<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

While the NLP community had success with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Language Modeling</a> and Translation using LSTM networks <span data-cites="hochreiter_long_1997">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)</span> and Encoder-Decoder architectures <span data-cites="sutskever_sequence_2014">Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le (2014)</span>, it was not until the invention of the <strong>attention</strong> mechanism <span data-cites="bahdanau_neural_2016">Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2016)</span> that things started to work spectacularly well.</p> <p>When processing language, each token, which could be a character, a word, or something in between, is fed into a recurrent network, such as an LSTM, which maintains a kind of memory of previously processed inputs. In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer. The optimizer is responsible for figuring out how to adjust the parameters of the network to make it learn the objective. Most optimizers are <a href="https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/">based on variations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</a>. However, many of these optimizers contain tunable parameters such as a learning rate themselves. Finding the right settings for a specific problem not only reduces training time, but can also lead to better results due to finding a better local minimum of the loss function.</p> <p>Big resarch labs often ran expensive hyperparameter searches that came up with complex learning rate schedules to get the best out of simple but hyperparameter-sensitive optimizers such as SGD.

Can add or remove some information from your context. The information is a powerful weapon in the programmer’s hand. If you call one of your classes <code>User</code>, what information this name gives you? Well, you can expect that this is a representation of a human, and he is using something. That’s all. But if you use a class name like <code>Guest</code>, <code>Gamer</code> or <code>Programmer</code>, you have more information. You know exactly, what that person does, what that person uses. The main question is: Do you need this information? As usual - it depends. You need to know the purpose of this name, what you want to achieve. Sometimes it is enough to have a <code>User</code>, but sometimes you need to be more precise.</p><h2 id="new-name-new-perspective">New name, new perspective</h2><p>Changing the name can give you a different perception, even a different context. It can allow you to look at the problem you are facing with from different angles. It’s like using six thinking hats by Dr. Edward de Bono. Each hat gives you a different perspective. Each hat focus on a specific area of the problem. The similar effect you can achieve with names. Take a look at the example below.</p><p>We want to get information about files from the S3 bucket. Of course, we have AWS SDK for that, but we want to be more specific. Adjust and wrap what AWS SDK gives us. So, we create a <strong>wrapper</strong> for that.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
 <span>class</span> <span>Wrapper</span>
   <span>def</span> <span>image_url</span>
   <span>end</span>

   <span>def</span> <span>get_file</span>
   <span>end</span>
   <span>...</span>
 <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>But wait, we just do file operations. We look for a file path, and we want to read/download the file from S3. Maybe we have something more than <code>Wrapper</code>. Maybe this is something like a <code>File</code>? A remote S3 file? Maybe we should think about that code not as a wrapper but as a remote S3 file:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>File</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>public_url</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>read</span>
    <span>end</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Don’t you think that this changed our perspective? I think so. Is the first name wrong? It depends. Our goal is important. We often say: <strong>Context is the king</strong>. The intention has meaning. The thing, we want to achieve. Good names are crucial for understanding the code. Sometimes we need many iterations for the name to be as descriptive as we want to. To show the right perspective on the problem. To be understood in the same way or at least in a very similar way through all the team. And even more, to have the same understanding with a client too. It’s the perfect situation when we use the same names/words during the development process not only in a development team but also with a client. We should create our common language - as Domain Driven Design calls it <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong>. It will allow us not only better understand our domain, our problem, and each other but also to see the right things and the connection between them.</p><h2 id="create-project-context-by-names">Create project context by names</h2><p>We are naming things that have meaning for us. Our words and our language shapes our world (problem or domain). Example from real life. Do you need one word for expressing a person very sensitive to the cold? People in Spain do. This word in Spanish is friolero. Or one word for telling about tiptoeing on hot sand? People in Nairobi have that word - hanyauku. It expresses their culture and the world around them. OK, but back to programming examples.</p><p>We have two names in the code:</p><p>You can look at these two variables for a long time, and it will be hard to understand their meaning. You can even think that this is a misspelling. Maybe someone just missed one letter <code>n</code> in the second variable? You need to go deeper into the code, spent some time reading it to understand what is going on. You will see that both variables are used. They have their declarations, so this is not a mistake. Then you can focus on the meaning. Plants have a scale of growth, which calls BBCH. They can be grouped in different stages of growing, blooming, or giving fruits. So, numbers 1 and 2 are this king of stages groups. Letter <code>n</code> is from how much nitrogen is in the soil during that stage. So <code>n1n2</code> is a multiplication of <code>n1</code> with <code>n2</code>. Variable <code>n12</code>, on the other hand, is a power of <code>n1</code> (multiplication <code>n1</code> with <code>n1</code>). Is it something you can easily get after reading these names? NO! Those names completely forget about context. They don’t explain their meanings, don’t create the language of the problem. In this situation, we should create specific language-related to the domain.</p><p>I hope those examples convinced you that names have a huge meaning. They can change your perspective, show code from different angles. Help you with understanding the problem, with the creation of the project language. Names can even help you with a better understanding of the project and show you the intention, bigger picture.</p><h2 id="13-tips-on-how-to-improve-names-in-the-project">13 tips on how to improve names in the project</h2><p>Now, this is a time for some tips to improve your names in the projects:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Name logical steps in your code</strong></p><p>When you have long calculations in your code, try to split them into smaller steps and descriptively name them. It will allow you and your team to understand the logic faster.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remaining_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>days</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>paid_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>-</span> <span>paid_amount</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div></li><li><p><strong>Names of methods should inform about what they really do</strong></p><p>For example, if a method changes the state of an object, it should inform you about this change. In Ruby, to do that, we use an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. Of course, this is only the names convention, so you can find methods that change the state but don’t have an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. No matter what, I think this is a good practice to use. The most important is to find a way to inform about what method really does.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use names for magic, static values in your code</strong></p><p>Give them meaning. Do not use 24. Instead of 24 use names like <code>day</code> and put it in the constant. In Ruby, we write a constant in an upper case like <code>DAY</code>. You have 7 in your code. Tell other team members that you mean <code>WEEK</code>. It will help you with communication via code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use descriptive names</strong></p><p>No more single-letter names. Use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, or modules. Create context for your code by using good and descriptive names. Allow other people in your team to quickly understand the code meaning based on names. If the name isn’t as precise as it should be, change it. Sometimes you need to do many iterations with the name to get the effect you want. It’s normal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the name to a specific level of abstraction</strong></p><p>It’s a hard one. Sometimes the name can be descriptive, but tells us too much or not enough on a specific level of abstraction. For example:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>create_tmp_file</span><span>(</span><span>image_path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I think <code>image_path</code> quite good tells what it is. It’s a path for an image file. But wait! Is that method only for image files or can be used in a wider context? Maybe the same code can be called for all kinds of files? When we have a name like <code>image_path</code> we narrow the usability of this function. It’s the name that isn’t good at this level of abstraction. Instead of <code>image_path</code> use <code>file_path</code>. It will show that you can put as an argument any file path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your programming language standards and conventions</strong></p><p>In Ruby, when you have to return a Boolean value, you should end it with a question mark <code>?</code> like <code>blank?</code>. When you want to convert an object to a string, you should use <code>to_s</code>. There is a lot of this kind conventions. Try to use your language conventions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tell what pattern you use</strong></p><p>I think it can help you with understanding the architecture. Try to use design patterns names in your code. For example, you have a <code>User</code> class, and you want to decorate it. You can create a <code>UserDecorator</code> class. Maybe even <code>AdminUserDecorator</code> if this is what it will decorate. More you are precise in your names, then better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your project standards and conventions</strong></p><p>When you have a complex domain, your project will need more conventions then only language level conventions. It’s why it is a good idea to create your project <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> and use it everywhere in the project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unequivocal names</strong></p><p>Try to create names that tell exactly what they really do. Name like <code>create_record</code> can be too general for your code. Maybe in your context name <code>create_blank_record</code> will be better. Don’t afraid long names too much. If you use the name once or twice, it’s OK to have a longer, more precise name.</p></li><li><p><strong>The longer scope, the longer name too</strong></p><p>If you have a short local scope, like a small loop, it is OK to use a variable like <code>i</code> to iterate by some range. But if you have a longer scope, like class scope, it will be much better to use more descriptive names. The longer scope you have, the longer, more descriptive names you should use. It will allow you to know exactly what is inside the variable. Remember also to don’t go with long names too much. At some point, long names also can be not clear and bring more complexity then readability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not use prefixes or suffixes with type or sub-domains</strong></p><p>It’s related to Hungarian notation too. Do not create a name like <code>i_age</code> because this is an <code>Integer</code> type of age value or <code>CRMInvoice</code>. It will be better to do <code>CRM::Invoice</code>. It will help you to put files into the right directories. If your whole system is …</p></li></ol></div></article></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/automated-content-distribution | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/automated-content-distribution">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>‍</p><p>Just recently, I started writing in public. First on '<a href="https://cowriters.app/" target="_blank">200 Words a Day</a>' (now called Cowriters); a digital community of people trying to keep up "writing at least 200 words per day", every day. After that, I started writing on&nbsp;Medium, which is a blogging platform. Then a little later, when I felt I could rationalize to myself&nbsp;the work of <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">building a website with webflow</a>, I started on my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>What channel? All channels!</h2><p>What I noticed posting on separate channels, is that different people hang out in various communities.&nbsp;</p><p>But these communities don't necessarily overlap. So some of my acquaintances, friends and family wouldn't see my&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran" target="_blank">Twitter</a>&nbsp;posts, while others only saw what I posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibranelbazi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Btw, I don't have Facebook or Instagram, so that is why there's nothing for me to talk about.)</em></p><p>This fragmentation of communities is no problem, of course.<strong> Everyone hangs out where they want to.</strong> But I did feel I wanted to reach some more people with my blog posts. And seeing my blog was new, it had not yet had the opportunity to rank in Google.</p><p>So I set out to post my articles on <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/how-to-divide-your-online-channels-in-the-4-most-important-segments">separate channels</a> by hand, which quickly turns into a repetitive chore. I don't like tedious tasks, <strong>which is why I automated the process </strong>— the details of which you can find below.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, I talk about what I automated, what tools I used, and how I set up the process automation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hopefully, you can use it for your processes!</strong></p><h2>Automation overview</h2><p>For every blog post I publish on my blog, I&nbsp;have automated a few steps:</p><p><strong>In Integromat:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Retrieve last published Article from Webflow</li><li>Search in an Airtable base if the article has already been published and shared before.</li><li>Extract the Category-ID of the article from the Webflow-object and map it to the right Category.</li><li>Check to which secondary flow (after the 'Router in Integromat) the article belongs.</li><li>Share the article on Twitter</li><li>Share the article on LinkedIn</li><li>Publish the article on 200-Words-a-Day</li><li>Retrieve the 200-Words-a-Day article URL</li><li>Save all article data in a 'Published Posts' table in Airtable</li></ul><p><strong>In Zapier:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Publish the article on Medium by retrieving the article data from Airtable</li></ul><h2>The Tools</h2><p><a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran" target="_blank">Integromat</a>&nbsp;- "... is the glue of the internet."

For that, you need to have a separate API-key from Medium (which I still have not received). <strong>Thus for that part of the process I used Zapier, which was easy peasy.</strong></p><p>By the way, I know there are services out there that do this (publishing automation) for you. But I like to have control over the specific format and filters of my processes. <strong>Also, I very much like building these automation flows.</strong></p><p>The flows are not perfect though. For example, I need to add the image source by hand on Medium.</p><p>What I still want to do is to add a flow where, when I update a post, it also updates on all channels I republished.</p><p>I genuinely hope you got some value out of this article.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Un guide pour intégrer les diagrammes Google Charts dans une page web et visualiser les informations provenant de la base de données dans un projet Laravel.</p><div>
							
							<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

							<p>On utilise une <a title="Voir représentation graphique sur Wikipédia" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repr%C3%A9sentation_graphique_de_donn%C3%A9es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">représentation graphique</a>&nbsp;pour faciliter l’interprétation des données, voir la proportion (l’importance) d’une valeur par rapport à un ensemble de valeurs, comparer les valeurs ou décrire une évolution, ...</p>
<p>Sur une page web, nous pouvons utiliser la librairie JavaScript <a title="Aller vers la page Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Charts</strong></a> pour représenter les données dans un graphique par des diagrammes interactifs tels que :</p>
<ul>
<li>Pie Chart : diagramme circulaire (« camembert » en France)</li>
<li>Bar Chart : histogramme, sous forme des bâtons</li>
<li>Line Chart</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Ce guide vous présente la technique pour représenter ou visualiser les données provenant d'une base de données avec Google Pie Chart et Bar Chart sur une vue (template Blade) dans un projet <a title="Aller vers le site web officiel Laravel" href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laravel</a>.</p>

								<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6226100796020554" data-ad-slot="1080726079"></ins>

							<h2 id="integrer-google-charts-dans-laravel">Intégrer Google Charts dans Laravel</h2>

							<p>La documentation sur <a title="Aller vers la galerie Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">la galerie Google Charts</a> présente le code source à utiliser pour reproduire un diagramme sélectionné.</p>
<p>La technique pour intégrer un diagramme dans un projet Laravel consiste à copier le code source présenté, le ramener (coller) sur une page ou une vue (template Blade), le personnaliser et adapter les données à celles de votre application :</p>
<ol>
<li>Copier le code source d’un chart depuis la galerie Google Chart</li>
<li>Coller le code source du chart sur votre page ou template Blade</li>
<li>Remplacer les valeurs du chart par celles de votre application</li>
</ol>
<p>Pour expliciter cette technique, nous allons prendre deux exemples d’intégration en récupérant les données de la base de données, les organisant pour les représenter au diagramme. Nous aurons pour cela besoin d’une route « diagram », d’un contrôleur « DiagramController » et d’une vue « diagram ».</p>
<p>Ajoutons la route « diagram » au fichier <strong>routes\php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>// La route pour afficher le diagramme
Route::get("diagram", "DiagramController@diagram")-&gt;name("diagram");</code></pre>
<p>L’action « diagram » de la route nommée « diagram » est gérée par le contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> que nous pouvons générer en exécutant la commande <em>artisan </em>suivante :</p>
<pre><code>php artisan make:controller DiagramController</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la logique de la méthode <code>diagram()</code> pour les données de chaque diagramme :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		$data = collect(); // Les données du diagramme

		// La vue "diagram"
		return view("diagram", compact('data'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Et la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> qui présente le diagramme avec les valeurs :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()-&gt;getLocale()) }}"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSRF Token --&gt;
    &lt;meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Laravel - Google Chart&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- Scripts --&gt;
    &lt;script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSS --&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
	
	&lt;h1&gt;Mon diagramme&lt;/h1&gt;

	&lt;!-- L'élément "#mon-chart" où placer le chart --&gt;
	&lt;div id="mon-chart" style="height: 500px; width: 800px;" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	// Le code du Chart
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la partie <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pour chaque diagramme.&nbsp; Mon diagramme sera placé dans l'élément <code>&lt;div id="mon-chart" &gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<p>L’arborescence des fichiers avec lesquels nous allons travailler est la suivante :</p>
<ul>
<li>app\Http\Controllers\<strong>DiagramController.php</strong></li>
<li>resources\views\<strong>diagram.blade.php</strong></li>
<li>routes\<strong>web.php</strong></li>
</ul>

															
							
							<h2 id="exemples-dintegration-google-pie-et-bar-charts">Exemples d'intégration Google Pie et Bar Charts</h2>

							<h3>Exemple 1 : Intégrer Google Pie Chart</h3>
<p>Supposons pour un site web e-commerce avoir une table « categories » dont le model <strong>App\Category.php</strong> représente une catégorie des produits (Ex : charcuterie, pâtisserie, viande, …) :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Chaque catégorie possède plusieurs produits. Nous voulons afficher la proportion des produits pour chaque catégorie dans un diagramme circulaire.</p>
<p>Pource faire, nous pouvons récupérer les catégories avec leurs produits de la manière suivante au contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

use App\Category;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		// Les catégories avec les produits
		$categories = Category::with("products")-&gt;get();

		// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
		return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Puis intégrer les données au <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Pie Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Pie</strong></a> sur la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {

    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégories', 'Produits'],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ "{{ $category-&gt;name }}", {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }} ], // Proportion des produits de la catégorie
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      title: 'Proportion des produits par catégorie', // Le titre
      is3D : true // En 3D
    };

    // On crée le chart en indiquant l'élément où le placer "#mon-chart"
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    // On désine le chart avec les données et les options
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1Y0e-UmRIC_RwCni2XB8xHeom6JUjmjRV" alt="Google Pie Chart avec des données d'une app Laravel"></p>
<h3>Exemple 2 : Intégrer Google Bar Chart</h3>
<p>Reprenons les mêmes données catégories avec produits. Nous voulons cette fois visualiser dans un histogramme le rapport quantité produits / ventes pour chaque catégorie.</p>
<p>Pour le nombre des ventes par catégorie, nous avons la relation suivante avec la table des ventes « sales » au modèle <strong>App\Category.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }

    // Les ventes de la catégorie
    public function sales () {
        return $this-&gt;hasManyThrough(Sale::class, Product::class);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Récupérons les catégories avec les produits et les ventes dans la méthode <code>diagram()</code> du contrôleur&nbsp;<strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>public function diagram () {

	// Les catégories avec les produits et les ventes
	$categories = Category::with("products", "sales")-&gt;get();

	// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
	return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

}</code></pre>
<p>Enfin, intégrons les données au&nbsp;<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Bar Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Bar Chart</strong></a> sur la vue&nbsp; <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['bar']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégorie', 'Produits', 'Ventes' ],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ '{{ $category-&gt;name }}', {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }}, {{ $category-&gt;sales-&gt;count() }} ],
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      chart: {
        title: 'Performance Catégories - Produits - Ventes',
        subtitle: 'Produits, Ventes pour chaque catégorie',
      },
      bars: 'vertical' // Direction "verticale" pour les bars
    };

    var chart = new google.charts.Bar(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    chart.draw(data, google.charts.Bar.convertOptions(options));
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1b0H6z_LXO4bQKJ5iuo5KuRSPQdmY__n7" alt="Google Bar Chart avec les données d'une app Laravel"></p>

															
							
							<h2 id="packages-laravel-google-charts">Packages Laravel - Google Charts</h2>

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain. Put on your poker face and ask hard subjective questions.</li><li>Bend the solutions to your problem, not new problems to old solutions.</li><li>Own your toolchain and not the other way around.</li><li>If the only tool you know is a hammer, everything will look like a nail. Identify those hammers. Be on the lookout for power drills.</li></ul><hr> <!-- Mailchimp for WordPress v4.7.7 - https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/ --><!-- / Mailchimp for WordPress Plugin --><hr></div> <!-- .entry-content --></article> <!-- .post --></div> <!-- #content .site-content --></div> <!-- #primary .content-area --> <!-- #secondary .widget-area .sidebar --></div> <!-- layout --></div></div>]]>

<p>Galaksija was to be in Yugoslavia what Commodore and Sinclair were in the west. Whether it succeeded or not, its deceptively simple design can still teach us a lot of interesting tricks on how to make a usable computer and operating system with as few transistors and bits as possible.

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>

<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>
<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>

<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly performing plant.</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>We are very happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.1 is released with some more great new features such as HEVC(H.265) support in WebRTC stack and WebM Recording. Previously <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-vp8-data-channel-and-4k-60fps-support/">In Ant Media Server v2.0</a>, VP8 and <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">Data Channel</a> features were released. We are continuously adding new features and doing performance optimizations. Before starting the post, let me thank you for your all interest to the Ant Media Server because you’ve made it run in more than 120 countries.After a brief introduction, let’s start the post.</p> <p>I think the most important feature in this release is the HEVC (H.265) support in WebRTC stack because it shows that what Ant Media can do beyond the limits in the industry. Of course, there are many more features and improvements such WebM recording, Unified Plan or PlanB,&nbsp; forcing quality in WebRTC playback, etc. Let me give the highlights for v2.1 and then you can also take a look the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole change log</a> for sure.</p> <h2>HEVC(H.265) Support in WebRTC Stack</h2> <p>I think the main question is about why it’s important to add HEVC aka. H265 support in WebRTC stack. The answer is clear: <strong>Providing better quality with the same bitrate.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg" alt="Ant Media Server HEVC Support in WebRTC" width="1022" height="376" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg 1022w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-300x110.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-768x283.jpg 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-600x221.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 1"></p> <p>Let me tell what we’ve done in Ant Media Server side. We originally use the <a href="https://webrtc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebRTC stack implemented by Google</a> and we’ve made it scalable to work in the server side. The recent changes is adding packetization and depacketization of HEVC frames in RTP protocol according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 7789</a> and adapting these changes to the WebRTC stack.&nbsp; &nbsp;We’ve also adapted these changes to the Android WebRTC SDK because most of the android devices have H.265 decoder to play the H.265 encoded WebRTC Stream.&nbsp; Before proceeding how to test HEVC, let us tell that HEVC support is an experimental feature for now.</p> <h2>How to Play HEVC WebRTC Stream in Ant Media Server</h2> <p>Most of the devices(mobile or desktop) do not have H.265 Encoder to be able use in WebRTC stack. Luckily, Android devices have H.265 decoder to play H.265 encoded streams. So it works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</li> <li>Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</li> <li>Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</li> </ol> <h3>1. Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</h3> <p>By default H.265 support is disabled in Ant Media Server so we need to enable it first. After you install the Ant Media Server,</p> <ul> <li>Open the following file <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li> <li>Enable H265 by adding below property to the file above <pre>settings.h265Enabled=true</pre> <p>I think we should also point out that Ant Media Server uses libx265 for soft encoding and it also support hevc_nvenc for hard encoding.</p></li> <li>Then make the following changes in the file as follows <pre>settings.vp8Enabled=false
settings.h264Enabled=false
settings.encoderSettingsString=360,800000,64000</pre> </li> <li>Save the file and restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li> </ul> <h3>2. Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</h3> <p>You can send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server with <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Open-Broadcaster-Software-Publishing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OBS as documented here</a>. Just send a stream with height 360p or over.</p> <h3>3. Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</h3> <p>With the new Android SDK, you don’t need to do anything. Just add your server address to the MainActivity and change the mode to Play and open the Activity. It’ll play the H.265 Encoded WebRTC on your Android Device. You can even check the incoming and outgoing SDPs to see the HEVC parameters there.</p> <h4>Good news for Android and IOS SDKs</h4> <p>We’ve decided to provide Android and iOS SDK’s for free. It’ll be available to download on <a href="https://antmedia.io/">antmedia.io</a> later this week.</p> <h2>WebM Recording</h2> <p>In this release, we’re also happy to announce WebM Recording. You can configure WebM recording the same way you do for MP4 recording.&nbsp; Let me tell what I mean.</p>  <h2>Improved Performance and Stability</h2> <p>We constantly improve performance and stability. With this release, there are less threads in both Java and Native side. It means there are less context switching in the same name number of publishers and viewers according to the previous version. We’ve also optimized the WebRTC Stack&nbsp; to make it consume less resources.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 2" width="489" height="302" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png 489w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4"></p> <p>Second improvement is about stability. We’ve improved our devops pipeline for cluster tests. So we’re having more integration test cases for both standalone and cluster modes. Moreover, we’ve also increased our quality gate for test coverage from %70 to %80.</p>  <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 3" width="500" height="145" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png 832w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-300x87.png 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-768x223.png 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-600x175.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 5"></p> <h2>Force WebRTC Playback Quality in Adaptive Bitrate</h2> <p>Here is the another feature that we’ve got so many requests about that. Let me explain it. When there are multi-bitrates in the server side, Ant Media Server measures the viewers internet speed and sends the best quality according to the internet speed of the viewer.&nbsp; For instance,</p> <ul> <li>Assume that there are two bitrates on the server <ul> <li>First one is 360p and 800kbps</li> <li>Second one is 480p and 1500kbps.</li> </ul> </li> <li>if Viewer internet speed <ul> <li>is above 1500kbps, then the resolution with 480p is sent.</li> <li>is between 800kbps and 1500kbps or less than 800kbps, then the resolution with 360p is sent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This is done automatically on the server side. However some users want to force the resolution and don’t want to the server to make it automatically.&nbsp; So we’ve defined a new message in websocket communication&nbsp; and implement it on server side and JS SDK side. It’s <em>forceStreamQuality&nbsp; </em>which is having two parameters <em>streamId</em> and <em>streamHeight.&nbsp; </em>You can get the streamHeights information by <em>getStreamInfo </em>message. Let me explain how.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg 360w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-300x200.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 6"></p> <p>Assume that you are <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Playing" rel="dofollow noopener" target="_blank">playing a WebRTC stream</a> that has some <a href="https://antmedia.io/adaptive-streaming-is-supported-for-live-streams-on-the-fly/">adaptive bitrates</a> on the server side. It means that you’ve created WebRTCAdaptor and call <em>getStreamInfo </em>after you receive <em>play_started</em> message.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo("{your_stream_Id}");</pre> <p>The method above will trigger the <em>streamInformation </em>callback and you can parse it with the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/player.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">same way in this file</a>. Then the only thing is calling <em>forceStreamQuality </em>as follows.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.forceStreamQuality("{your_stream_Id}",&nbsp; {the_resolution_to_be_forced});</pre> <p>We’ll provide this to be very easy to use in the embedded player as a built-in feature in the next release.</p> <p>To sum up,&nbsp; these are the highlights for v2.1. You can check <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole release notes here</a> .Thank you again for your interest to Ant Media Server and we have some more exciting things on their way. Stay tuned and keep in touch.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<br><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/i.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="11"><span size="+1">n
October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/selections/charlotte/charlotte1.htm">Charlotte</a>.</span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><em>Serverless approach to real-time analytics now decouples storage from compute in the cloud to outperform operational model of Elasticsearch, Apache Druid and others</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SAN MATEO, Calif.</strong> – July 28th, 2020 – <a href="https://rockset.com/">Rockset</a>, the real-time indexing database company, today announced new product features—including decoupling of storage from compute in the cloud, and separation of query-compute from ingest-compute—further eliminating the operational barriers in achieving real-time analytics at scale.</p>
<p>To stay ahead in the digital economy, companies need to personalize user experiences, build real-time decision systems and automate actions using sensor data. These types of  applications demand both very low latency and complex analytical queries on a variety of data formats from different sources. Since real-time data is messy and bursty, the high operational cost and complexity in ingesting and querying real-time data at scale has been a major barrier for enterprises moving from batch to real-time.</p>
<p>Built by the creators of <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rocksdb-is-eating-the-database-world/">RocksDB</a>, Rockset automatically builds Converged Indexes™ on any data—including structured, semi-structured, geographical and time series data—for high performance search and analytics at scale. It supports real-time SQL queries on semi-structured data, so for the first time ever, developers have the flexibility to build features that search, aggregate and join any type of data from any source on the fly. When combined with serverless operations, it is a game-changing approach to making real-time analytics fast, flexible and easy.</p>
<p>With this new release, Rockset decouples query-compute, ingest-compute and hot storage in the cloud, allowing developers to scale the exact resources needed in the cloud and seamlessly adapt to variability. Traditional systems suffer from compute contention during bursty ingest or spikes in queries, so data becomes stale and queries slow down—making it operationally challenging to enable real-time decisions. Separating query compute from ingest compute avoids resource contention, and as a result, data freshness is guaranteed and query performance is never compromised. Additionally, while new data continues to stream in, old data grows over time and is less frequently queried. Scaling storage independently from compute allows customers to seamlessly control their price-performance over the lifecycle of the dataset, simply by adjusting the compute allocation over time.</p>
<p>Rumble Wellness, a company that encourages a healthy lifestyle by rewarding users based on their daily step count, uses real-time data to increase user engagement. "Rockset is pure magic. We chose Rockset over Druid, because it requires no planning whatsoever in terms of indexes or scaling. In one hour, we were up and running, serving complex OLAP queries for our live leaderboards and dashboards at very high queries per second. As we grow in traffic, we can just ‘turn a knob’ and Rockset scales with us," said Yaron Levi, Chief Architect at Rumble Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>With the new release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is served from hot storage, and automatically backed up on durable cloud storage, with per-GB pricing.</li>
<li>Compute resources are scaled independently as required, with per-minute billing.</li>
<li>The compute resources are used for ingesting data or querying data from hot storage. Scaling compute resources results in instant performance gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>“First-generation real-time analytics solutions like Elasticsearch and Druid tightly coupled storage and compute because they were optimized for the datacenter era. But this leads to over-provisioning of resources and makes it difficult to manage costs at scale,” said Dhruba Borthakur, co-founder and CTO, Rockset. “On the other hand, scaling storage and compute independently in the cloud provides the benefits of improved scalability, availability and better price-performance ratios. Rockset’s cloud-native architecture and serverless technology already enables massive operational gains for customers, and these new features will further enable developers to achieve real-time analytics at scale.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks. Reclaim works perfectly and noise-lessly to manage our calendars, and is free.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-34v18"><p><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Miro</strong></u></span></a><span>. From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members. And again, free. Amazing.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-b9h22"><span>That’s it, that’s what you need to start. Everything a SaaS startup needs to get up and running, for under $100 a month. </span></p><p id="viewer-61iv0"><span>--- </span></p><p id="viewer-8hurk"><span><strong>Epilogue</strong></span> </p><p id="viewer-dpf11"><span>As we’ve grown, there are other apps we’ve added or replaced. We needed a CI tool so we went with CircleCI. We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

                    <p>India made over 1.3 billion UPI transactions last month. Spread over 150 banks and hundreds of mobile apps, every single UPI transaction followed the same identical flow—Apps asked for the same set of user inputs, showed the same screens, used a common PIN to authenticate and displayed the same messages. Which begs the question;</p><blockquote><strong>What if loan applications were like this too?</strong></blockquote><p>What if we could dramatically simplify loan applications to make them almost as simple as making a UPI payment? Imagine a world in which every loan application is simplified, standardised, and digitised, regardless of which lender you approached—no more chasing after bank statements <em>(don't forget to get it stamped!)</em>, no more signing every page of endless agreements <em>(in blue ink Saar, black ink not acceptable!)</em>, no more branch manager certificates, no more filling out half a dozen forms, or uploading your grandparents’ kundalis.</p><p>And for those less fortunate among us, no more implicit judgement of a loan application based on arbitrary social status indicators like dark skin, or a poorer grasp of English. When it comes to financial inclusion, human biases and prejudices often come in the way of access to credit to those who need it the most. </p><p>What if we had a standardised fully digital credit flow, powered by a uniform set of open APIs? And what if we used these APIs to make credit available via any and all apps borrowers use—the UPI payment app used by a vegetable seller, the delivery agent partner app used by a food delivery boy, or the accounting software used by an SME—all of them.</p><blockquote><strong>This is OCEN</strong>—the Open Credit Enablement Network. A single API with a uniform flow to power a billion loans for India.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

Today large lenders favour larger ticket size loans because they create enough unit margin to cover the costs of distribution, servicing, and collections. The unit-economics of sachet-sized loans can be improved through a digital paperless customer experience. By lowering CAC, op-ex, and collection costs, through digitisation, &nbsp;we can make a small ticket-size loan of around ₹10,000 with a repayment cycle of a few days viable for even the largest banks. </p><p>Further, India needs new ways of <em><strong>distributing</strong></em> these credit products at massive scale. Only deeply-embedded digital distribution at scale can make smaller and affordable credit products economically viable for lenders. We can achieve this by seamlessly embedding lending flows into the very activity the credit is funding:</p><p><em>Credit for fuel for a trucker should be available at the point and time of fuelling.</em></p><p><em>A kirana store needs credit offers at the time of placing orders with their distributor.</em></p><p><em>A B2B SME struggling to collect payments from corporates, needs invoice financing immediately after a completed delivery.</em></p><p>Enabling these flows requires us to move selling loans via generic DSAs, agents, and towards specialised originators that work and transact deeply with the end-borrower in specific business flows. These entities haven't distributed financial products historically and are unfamiliar with existing paper-based processes of lenders, and are unwilling to take them on. </p><p>For specialised origination to work, we need to remove the barriers between lenders and these new-age originators. With <a href="https://lsp-spec.setu.co/">OCEN APIs</a> loan applications will be simplified, standardised, and digitised thus making it easier for new types of distributors to integrate and work with multiple lenders. Thus extending their ability to reach, underwrite, and collect from a borrower anywhere in the country.</p><p>In effect, India needs a new class of loan products—both in terms of design and distribution—to meet the special needs of the trucker, the kirana store and the B2B manufacturer, and to enable specialised lenders to reach these borrowers.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg" alt="" width="5606" height="2035" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Setu's OCEN APIs</figcaption></figure><p>The OCEN APIs enable financial institutions to deliver their products to wherever their customers are. A standardised API between a lender and a mobile app provider means the kirana store can get and manage a loan entirely on a non-financial app like WhatsApp—no paperwork, no branch visits, and no phone calls. </p><blockquote>OCEN APIs are <strong>designed for easy plug and play by customer facing platforms and apps</strong>, with minimal integration efforts.</blockquote><p>The OCEN APIs thus create a common interface—like UPI—so that value-chain players who are close to an MSME and financial institutions which have a deep understanding of the MSME’s business can come together to create a new class of loan products.</p><p>At Setu, we have been keen students of OCEN since inception.

						<article id="post-4178">

                             
							<section itemprop="articleBody">

								<p><span>I cannot think of a better interlocutor than <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/">Chris Dilow</a>. He raises another set of interesting questions in his <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/07/ideas-interests-and-capital.html">reply</a> to my <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/angrynomics-a-reply-to-chris-dillow/">reply</a>. I am in danger of completely forgetting our original divergence of thought, but that bothers me not at all.</span></p>
<p><span>I have read a lot of Marx, and always want to read more. Marx is rightly regarded as the greatest social theorist. Marx was legendary synthesiser of thought. In this regard, <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/values-in-economics/">Habermas</a> – the <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/the-most-important-social-scientist-since-keynes/">greatest moral philosopher since Kant</a> – is his true heir. </span></p>
<p><span>Marx also created a framework of making sense of social change, organisation and power which is unrivalled in its completeness and coherence. In addition to his profound perceptiveness, this very coherence and completeness appeals in its own right. But I feel a different form of intellectual affinity with Marx. The coherence he attributes to social evolution is also the weakness in his framework. Marx, if you take his writing as a whole, knew this instinctively. There is a coherent theory of social evolution to be found in his writings, but there is also repeated arbitrary divergence from this theory and creative, chaotic asides that make his writing so absorbing. We can thank Marx for providing a theory of social change, a theoretical ‘ideal type’. It is a model that it almost always pertinent, but – perhaps always – incomplete, and often completely misleading.</span></p>
<p><span>A perspective I have long held about markets I partly attribute to Marx. It is actually an argument for the moral force of markets (not capitalism, per se, but certainly markets) – that free exchange is the antithesis of tribalism. The great French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, put it most succinctly: “In order to trade, we must first lay down our spear”. Marx, too, saw very clearly how global capitalism could be the enemy of tribal nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps intriguingly, I also want to bring Hayek in here. Hayek, Marx and Mauss view markets in ways which are far more instructive than that present in microeconomic textbooks. And here simplistic economic ideology has hindered understanding. So, one evolutionary function of markets is as a positive-sum method of conflict resolution. Everyone should be aware of this. If we perceive there to be a finite resource – say oil – let us use prices to determine who gets what, and incentivise the invention of substitutes. It’s better than the alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek diverges from the standard micro-theory of markets by assuming imperfect information – quite rightly – and focussing on the role markets play in processing information. This too is profoundly insightful. In Hayek’s view, capital seeks informational advantages – this is a motivating force. If we already knew everything, we would do nothing. The pursuit of ‘excess return’ is the very lifeblood of innovative and dynamic capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek’s observations on the distribution of information are equally important. His critique of central planning significantly resides in the insight that the most important information is local to the individual and unobservable – it is in our heads. Only the individual knows what they want at any point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside, it is worth noting that Keynes, unsurprisingly, was the most astute psychologist in this cannon of thinkers on the motives of capital. He was totally open to the likelihood that many of the greatest investors – i.e. those that had the longest time-horizons and made the greatest contributions to human well-being – were motivated by nothing more than fascination at what could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span>How does any of this bear on my discussion with Chris? My sense is that the motives and forms of capital at work in our societies are more diverse than at any point since the industrial revolution.  As Mark and I argue in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angrynomics-Eric-Lonergan/dp/1788212797/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?adgrpid=100757164789&amp;cv_ct_cx=angrynomics&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAWWpdQP-57O0aMprUkKmpjQbVHNLZX8R0CBQQI7Zar3_prk6eVgopBoCIKEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=435785345402&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9045955&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17321262343375037874&amp;hvtargid=kwd-884601278301&amp;hydadcr=24397_1816021&amp;keywords=angrynomics&amp;pd_rd_i=1788212797&amp;pd_rd_r=9a0d48ba-8492-4b48-b95c-ff635870897b&amp;pd_rd_w=RS60x&amp;pd_rd_wg=H99aG&amp;pf_rd_p=9b1a9511-9af9-4d06-8643-d54ebec511ef&amp;pf_rd_r=AP1416WT4M1BSGAJVPF5&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1595773559&amp;sr=1-1-fdbae751-0fa5-4c0f-900b-865654896618&amp;tag=googhydr-21">Angrynomics</a></em>, deregulation has set capital against capital, and asset price delusions add spice to this chaos. Myopic speculators finance blue-sky infinite-horizon destroyers of capital, such as Elon Musk – the world’s embodiment of a Keynesian investor.  Somewhat hilariously, a new form of elite social status – start-upism – is fantastically anti-capital, and its effects are super-charged by the secular collapse in the cost of semi-conductors. Despite its importance, none of this was predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>I struggle to see capital as the obstacle to progress in this world. If anything, a chaotic series of capitalist motivations – a collapse in the cost of debt to the state and a plethora of extraordinary technological innovations – have provided us with the very <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM-Europe-roundtable.pdf">means to tackle our greatest challenges</a>. The failure of innovation is in public policy and democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me in conclusion to more a ominous question. Hayek explained why China could not succeed. Central planning doesn’t work because the most important information is in our heads – only we know what we want to do. Really? Why has China progressed more rapidly and pervasively than any other major economy in AI, machine learning, fintech and social media. Because the contents of our minds is now available to the social planner. Is Marx about to have the last laugh?</span></p>

<p>I’ve been enjoying the ongoing <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/2020-workshop-information/">MIT STAMP workshop</a>. In particular, I’ve been enjoying listening to Nancy Leveson talk about system safety. Leveson is a giant in the safety research community (and, incidentally, an author of <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/nver-tse.pdf">my favorite software engineering study</a>). She’s also a critic of <em>root cause</em> and <em>human error</em> as explanations for accidents.  Despite this, she has a different perspective on safety than many in the resilience engineering community. To sharpen my thinking, I’m going to capture my understanding of this difference in this post below.</p>



<p>From Leveson’s perspective, <em>the engineering design should ensure that the system is safe</em>. More specifically, the design should contain <em>controls</em> that eliminate or mitigate <em>hazards</em>. In this view, accidents are invariably attributable to design errors: a hazard in the system was not effectively controlled in the design. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"The operator's job is to make up for the holes in the designer's work." – Jens Rasmussen (1981)</p>— John Allspaw (@allspaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw/status/225615911074267136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2012</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By contrast, many in the resilience engineering community claim that <em>design alone cannot ensure that the system is safe.</em> The idea here is that the system design will always be incomplete, and the human operators must adapt their local work to make up for the gaps in the designed system. These adaptations usually contribute to safety, and sometimes contribute to incidents, and in post-incident investigations we often only notice the latter case.</p>



<p>These perspectives are quite different. Leveson believes that depending on human adaptation in the system is itself dangerous. If we’re depending on human adaptation to achieve system safety, then the design engineers have not done their jobs properly in controlling hazards. The resilience engineering folks believe that depending on human adaptation is <em>inevitable</em>, because of the messy nature of complex systems.</p>

<p><em>Quick side note: So far, I have opened two Google Home Mini. On these two units, the NAND Flash component used isn't the same. However, to keep things simple, this article will expect a <code>TC58NVG1S3HBAI6</code> flash is used all along.</em></p>
<p>Most components are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> components. It makes reverse-engineering the system harder: difficult for instance to probe individual signals between two integrated circuits. Further, reliably reworking the board (i.e. desoldering and soldering back a component) requires quite some skills.</p>
<p>I didn't find any active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a> interface during my research. Same goes for debug <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> test points.</p>
<p>Finally, it's important to note that the main CPU comes without public documentation. Very few details about this component are available online. All the juicy technical data is likely protected by a <em>NDA</em>.</p>
<p>To conclude, at first sight, the hardware looks rather annoying to work with and doesn't appear to be very <em>talkative</em>.</p>

<p>As you might expect, I'm not the only one who has been studying the Google Home devices. Here is a quick summary of what others have discovered at the time of writing of this article.</p>
<h2 id="chromecast vulnerabilities">Chromecast Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The hardware and software of the Google Home Mini is very close to what is embedded into Google Chromecast devices. Hence, it's interesting to have a look at what have been discovered against this product.  </p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> was able to root Chromecast devices with a vulnerability affecting the bootloader. A buffer overflow vulnerability triggered thanks to a special USB peripheral led to a full secure boot bypass. The vulnerability is detailed <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt1/">here</a> and <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt2/">there</a>.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has now been patched and the Google Home family was never affected by the issue.</p>
<p>However, the work from <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> has two interesting takeaways for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many eyes already had a look at the bootloader. It's reducing the likelihood I can still discover something to exploit in it to bypass the secure boot on a Google Home Mini.</li>
<li>The articles highlight that Google has released the source code for the bootloader and Linux Kernel running on the Chromecast. Same goes for the Google Home family. Everything is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0B3j4zj2IQp7MZkplRzRvcERtaU0">here</a>. This source code will be extremely useful in the second article of this series.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="defcon27 presentation">DEFCON27 Presentation</h2>
<p>Another very important piece of information is the presentation given during <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/">DEFCON27</a> untitled <em>"Breaking Google Home: Exploit It with SQLite(Magellan)"</em>. The slides are available <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Wenxiang-Qian-Yuxiang-Li-Huiyu-Wu-Breaking-Google-Home-Exploit-It-with-SQLite-Magellan.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the presentation, an attack affecting the userspace software of the Google Home is detailed. This led to the result I want to achieve: code execution on the Google Home.</p>
<p>While extremely informative, the attack described by the presentation cannot be used against my own device anymore. The bugs have all been patched already.</p>
<p>However, the presentation contains an interesting slide that summarizes quite well what the attack surface of the Google Home Mini is.</p>

<p><img src="https://courk.cc/running-custom-code-google-home-mini-part1/assets/google_mini_attack_surface.png"></p><p>The Google Home Mini attack surface</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> work is shown, as well as possible network attacks that are explored in the presentation.</p>
<p>What's left is to research vulnerabilities on the WiFi/BLE module of the device or to modify the firmware stored in the NAND Flash of the device.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my own goal">My Own Goal</h2>
<p>These studies make very clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Google Home Mini is protected by some kind of secure boot. Bootloader and Kernel are cryptographically verified.</li>
<li>Many interesting attack vectors have already been explored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering this, I chose to go the the <em>NAND Flash way</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My goal will be to modify the NAND flash content until I can execute my own code.</strong></p>
<p><em>"What's the point?"</em> you might ask. Well, here are a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's the most direct way of achieving code execution on the platform.</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis of the Goggle Home software <strong>running on the actual hardware</strong> becomes possible.</li>
<li>Similarly, it may be useful to explore the WiFi/BT module attack vector.</li>
<li>As explained before, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip">SoC</a> of the Google Home Mini comes without any public documentation. Being able to run custom code on it is valuable to understand it better. Things like dumping the <em>BootROM</em> of the system becomes possible.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it's an interesting challenge that will need me to go down the rabbit hole. The content and structure of the NAND Flash will need to be understood. A exploit could be needed to bypass the secure boot.</li>
</ul>
<p>This path may sound like the easiest way to go to achieve code execution, but an important challenge will first need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I explained in the previous section, the hardware design of the Google Home Mini is not <em>"rework friendly"</em> at all.</p>
<p>The NAND Flash is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> component. Desoldering and soldering it back is easier said than done, especially considering I'll likely have to do it multiple times. Some little tricks will need to be used.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="general concept idea">General Concept Idea</h2>
<p>Repeatedly desoldering and soldering back the NAND Flash would have been annoying and could have caused damage to to the PCB.</p>
<p>Manually soldering thin wires to the BGA footprint for breaking out the NAND Flash lines could have been risky because of signal integrity issues. It wouldn't have been a very clean and, more importantly, reliable solution.</p>
<p>Hence, to overcome this burden, I developed <em>NandBug</em>.</p>
<p><em>NandBug</em> is composed of three boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Interposer Board</em> that's soldered to the Google Home Mini PCB, right at the NAND Flash location. This board breaks out the NAND Flash signals to a tiny connector.</li>
<li>The <em>Main Board</em>, that can be connected to both the <em>Interposer Board</em> and <em>Daughter Board</em>. It can communicate with a computer through a USB interface.</li>
<li>The <em>Daughter Board</em>. The delicate BGA NAND Flash IC is soldered to this board.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general concept of <em>NandBug</em> is described by the following diagram.</p>

<p>In a word, thanks to this system, the NAND Flash IC can be accessed from both the Google Home circuit and the electronic of the <em>Main Board</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>The general idea is in fact to make the NAND Flash of the Google Home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming">in-system programmable</a>. It may sound like an over engineered solution and it maybe is. But, hey, I'm doing this project for fun anyway.</p>

<p>Our vision of the smart home today is a series of disaggregated interactions with smart devices that control the domestic flow of a household, from controlling light ambience and temperature control to front door security. However, Big Tech’s move into the smart home space is reflective of a vastly different approach. Consumer-focused Big Tech, Google Amazon and Apple are interested in the smart home as an extension of the consumer’s interaction with the digital world – where their core propositions lie. Currently, a consumer’s interactions with Big Tech’s core propositions whether it is search, commerce or software is through the mobile or the desktop. An individual in the privacy and the comfort of the home represents an opportunity to create a touchpoint that transcends both the desktop and the mobile. However, a disaggregated bundle of smart devices, while utility-driven, don’t tap into the full potential of a truly high tech smart home ‘experience’. So what is the lucrative future big tech is chasing in consumer homes?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across all three consumer tech companies, their approach to reach the consumer within their home has been through the combination of an AI assistant paired with a smart speaker, a voice portal to the digital world. In thinking about transcending interactions beyond mobile or desktop, voice-based interactions are an almost natural evolution. Voice is both intuitive and hands-free and eminently suited to the quiet and privacy of the home. For this reason, dominating voice-based interactions has become the front line in the battle for a lead on smart homes. While the market is currently segregated largely between Amazon’s Alexa/Echo and Google’s Assistant/Home, Apple has made a tentative first step with the Apple Pod. The real motivator is to become the gatekeeper of our digital interactions in the home insofar as they evolve beyond the mobile and the desktop.</p>



<h3>The voice portal: a defensive and offensive strategy</h3>



<p>For Big Tech the voice portal represents two-fold value. The first it helps to bulwark their existing core propositions from erosion. For example, Google dominates search and will want to ensure that it retains that dominance even as search evolves to include voice-based search. Similarly Google and Apple’s role as gatekeepers of software through the Android and iOS app stores and Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce benefit similarly by capturing and dominating any evolution of these propositions through voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is the more important value to pursue. It is that the voice portal and all of its interactions represent an opportunity to create new and fertile fields for Big Tech to laterally expand its core proposition. The closest representations of this lateral expansion is perhaps the app store. The mobile app store acted as the gateway to the consumer’s experience of the mobile phone. Similarly, when wearables became mainstream, smartwatch specific app stores focused on leveraging the smart watch’s specific mode of interaction determined the consumer’s experience of wearables. In a similar vein, the AI assistant and speaker combination acts as the app store equivalent for voice specific interactions. Just as existing digital services built for the mobile and the smartwatch, they will build for voice-based interactions by integrating with voice-enabled AI assistants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Smart home devices versus a smart home experience&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When we’re talking about smart home devices, it can range from a thermostat to a smart fridge – many of the use cases will require specific hardware that results in some type of discrete action. A smart home experience, on the other hand, would require an underlying cohesion that held the home ecosystem together and enhanced the resident’s life – this extends beyond isolated devices that perform isolated functions. We can think of the voice portal as the underlying system that provides cohesion for the smart home, needing to deliver an experience as robust and desirable as the digital experience currently available to us through phones and computers. When users feel notifications on their phone are equal in value to the notifications on their smart speaker, that’s when the portal really opens up to allow for immense value capture. This kind of potential is then able to be channelled profitably through killer applications catered to the voice portal. But let’s take a deeper look at why the experience, as opposed to discrete function, lends itself to greater adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the voice portal to become accessible to a broad audience, users have to be convinced of the added value in the experience of voice interactions. But in order to do this the voice portal will need applications that demonstrate value-add in a meaningful way – where the convenience and experience outweigh the cognitive expense of the transition to voice. To understand this, we can break down the tiers of voice interaction. While the more complex interactions bear a higher cognitive burden they are also the most lucrative opportunities to create an experience rather than an isolated function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tier 1: Routine one-way interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong>&nbsp; smart device feeds you information based on preset prompts – e.g. Lights turn on at a certain hour, reads the weather every morning etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>little to no cognitive expense on the part of the consumer</p>



<p>Tier 2: Two-way interaction:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to the device spontaneously and the device reacts – e.g. set an alarm, meeting reminder etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device to execute on commands</p>



<p>Tier 3: Consumer interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> purchases through the voice device – e.g. order groceries, pay bills etc</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device with the financial element of the consumers life</p>



<p>Tier 4: Push to public interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to platforms on the internet that will be visible to others&nbsp; – e.g. interact with social media through voice dictation&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden:</strong> cognitive expense of trusting the device to signal appropriately to the public, the consumer’s self and reputation</p>



<p>When thinking about the first three types of interaction&nbsp; (one way, two way and consumer) it becomes clear that the original experience remains largely unchanged except for the added convenience of not needing to pick up a device and do it manually. For example, using voice control to turn on the lights, set an alarm, order groceries etc. But ‘push to public interactions’ exhibit characteristics that enhance the existing experience of activities like social media interaction. For example, Facebook might allow for important notifications, status updates, voice dictation for posts etc. More importantly, it could give notifications on social signalling, such as number of likes, comments and other elements that the user would associate with their social capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way the digital social experience becomes a natural extension of the user’s home life, providing a more plugged in, socially intuitive voice experience that reflects traditional social interactions – the current digital experience of social media is static in the sense that it only exists when the user taps into it. The voice portal would allow users with a preference for it, to integrate their digital and physical social experience in a more seamless way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience-based functions are superior in being able to deliver additional value capture because they increase touchpoints for existing services while enhancing the experience of those services. ‘User based services’ are then probably best positioned to be the killer applications for voice portals, much like they are for the browser and mobile today. While smart devices and discrete functions are definitely useful, their value add remains scattered without the cohesion of voice enhanced experiences. It then becomes clear why Big Tech is in a race to dominate the home, as they become the gatekeepers to all the value that funnels through the voice portal as users make that transition.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. The execution of voice as a human-centric user interface will determine the adoption of voice-based technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>“Interfaces to digital systems of the future will no longer be machine-driven. They will be human-centric,” explains Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, “We can build human natural interfaces to digital systems and with that, a whole environment will become active.”</p>



<p>“VUI [Voice-user interface] allows for hands-free, efficient interactions that are more ‘human’ in nature than any other form of user interface. “Speech is the fundamental means of human communication,” writes Clifford Nass, Stanford researcher and co-author of Wired for Speech, “…all cultures persuade, inform and build relationships primarily through speech.” In order to create VUI systems that work, developers need to fully understand the intricacies of human communication.”</p>



<p>The benefits of voice as a mode of interaction above traditional user interfaces encompasses the ability to create efficiency and convenience (hands-free), design a more human experience and imbue personality and tone to interactions creating greater brand affinity.</p>



<p>“Google Home is totally au fait with pop culture references, from Star Trek to Sir Mix A Lot, as is Amazon’s Alexa. A more personable tone helps users to forgive those moments when virtual assistants are unable to complete tasks or answer questions that an actual human would have no problem with.”</p>



<p>There are however multiple roadblocks to an immersive and coherent implementation of voice-based technologies.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>After working at Google for four years after college, I’ve now been at
<a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> for a bit under a year. People often ask - how does
it compare?</p>

<h2 id="what-i-miss">What I miss</h2>

<h3 id="the-developer-tools">The developer tools</h3>
<p>Google’s internal developer tools are really nice - here’s a few things I
find myself missing or dealing with worse versions on a day to day basis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flume (<a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, sort of): The internal
tooling around building large scale batch compute pipelines is top notch,
and I didn’t appreciate it nearly enough at the time!</li>
  <li>Critique: The internal code review site. Nicely integrated with other tools
and the turn-taking philosophy and CL Monitor chrome extension were top
notch.</li>
  <li>BUILD files and Blaze aka <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>: I encounter more
mysteriously broken builds or build processes in a few weeks now than I did
in years at Google. (A couple of my friends missed it enough to start a
company, <a href="https://buildbuddy.io/">BuildBuddy</a>, around it)</li>
  <li>Codesearch: Sourcegraph just doesn’t cut it - I think the tighter
integration really benefits Codesearch (“Find References” basically always
works, etc). And command-line searching with <code>grep</code> or <code>ack</code> isn’t even in
the same category of tool.</li>
  <li>Cider and CitC: A really nice browser-based editor and source code that
magically synced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-401k">The 401k</h3>
<p>Google has one of the rare 401k plans that allows for the <a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/the-mega-backdoor-roth-ira/">“mega backdoor
401k”</a>, which
allow you to contribute after-tax dollars up to the $57,000 limit and convert
them to a Roth 401k. With the 50% match on the normal set of contributions,
you’d end up with <code>$19,500 * 150% = $29,250</code> in traditional pre-tax
contributions and <code>$57,000 - $29,250 = $27,750</code> in converted Roth contributions
per calendar year! It’s a really great way to put money away quickly and it’s
feasible on high L3 (new grad) or L4 (one level up) Bay Area engineer
<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/company/Google/salaries/Software-Engineer/">comp</a> on
up.</p>

<h3 id="memegen">Memegen</h3>
<p>Memegen is Google’s internal meme site and cultural icon; at its best it’s a
wonderful, hilarious place. (At its worst, not so much… read on)</p>

<h3 id="the-people">The people</h3>
<p>Maybe a little cliché, but I worked with a lot of great people at Google on
<a href="https://fi.google.com/">Fi</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/329395083">Tailor</a> (RIP) and
it’s sad to not be working with them any more!</p>

<p>I’ve enjoyed working at a place that’s generally a hungrier for success.  This
doesn’t mean working crazy hours, but it does mean making the ones you do work
count, and at this point in my career I’m not ready to rest-and-vest. (I
actually literally did that at Google for three months after my last team got
shut down, and hated it - but that’s a story for another time.)</p>

<h3 id="working-on-trying-to-make-money">Working on trying to make money</h3>
<p>This is maybe a weird comment to make about an extraordinarily profitable
company- but large parts of the Google engineering workforce are pretty far
removed from the actual business of making money, leading to some classic
issues like favoring new projects that’ll get you promoted. It’s refreshing to
get back to focusing on business success instead of fuzzier metrics.</p>

<h3 id="learning-transferable-tech">Learning transferable tech</h3>
<p>I’ve been pretty happy to expand my skillset to use a bunch of different AWS
tools (S3, EC2, Kinesis, Aurora, Elasticsearch) and others (Kubernetes) that’ll
be relevant at other companies; Google’s stack was good but I sometimes
got the feeling that I was over-specializing.</p>

<h3 id="no-memegen">No Memegen</h3>
<p>Memegen, especially post-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber">Damore
manifesto</a>,
became less of a fun way to poke fun at fancy lunches and instead became a
battleground. Ultimately it resulted in more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">employee organizing and
advocacy for important
issues</a>,
which was good, but mentally it made it tougher to justify staying. 
(Rightly so! But my early 2010s halcyon vision of Google had been broken.)</p>

<h3 id="the-people-1">The people</h3>
<p>Turns out I get to work with a lot of great people at <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> too!</p>

    <p>Large projects and mono repos can be a pain to navigate. <strong>gg</strong>
is a small script I use almost everyday to make it easier.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with WordPress —&nbsp;or really most CMSes for
that matter — the base application configuration, themes,
plugins, etc. are typically given their own sub directories to
help isolate them. For WordPress development, I use the
<a href="https://roots.io/">Roots</a> stack and it does a great job of
making the project structure relavant, however, since it is
still WordPress, the project structure is not exactly flat.
Often I’ll need to jump to Trellis’ directory to start the
development VM, run a deploy, or update an environment’s
configuration, but shortly after jump back to the directory of
the theme or plugin I’m working on. Remembering the level of
depth and simply writing out the path can be a tedious and
erroneous task.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h2>
<p><strong>gg</strong> is a very simple Bash script I wrote to make is 100%
easier to jump between directories in a large project. Here’s a
short clip of it in action with a Roots project:</p>

<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0SjUNTfzKk" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-script">Breaking down the script</h2>
<p>There are a few requirements you will need before you get started:</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: <code>git</code>, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"><code>ag</code></a></p>
<p>You most likely should be able to achieve the same thing with
built-in tools or alternatives to <code>fd</code> and <code>ag</code> (maybe even
<code>fzf</code>), but for this tutorial, I’ll use the tools listed above.
One note before diving into the script, I do have the following
set for my FZF default command:</p>
<pre><span>export </span><span>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>='</span><span>ag -g ""</span><span>'
</span></pre>
<p>The script itself is pretty simple. There are two parts to it.
First, if we want to see all of the directories within our
project, even if we are already in a nested directory, we will
need to jump to the root of the Git repo. Luckily, it is
relatively easy to do this with Git. Using Git’s <code>rev-parse</code>
subcommand with the <code>--show-toplevel</code> flag, we can get “the
absolute path of the top-level-directory.” Since this is useful
in itself, but still a tad cumbersome to remember and write out,
we’ll create a function for it:</p>
<pre><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>If you already have a set of Git-aliases, you might find naming
conflicts with the ones I will create in this tutorial and in
that case, or in the case you don’t like the names I’ve picked,
you will need to use a different name.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an easy way to find a sub-directory.
If you’ve ever used a fuzzy-search tool, you’ll know that that
they are pretty great. Knowing the fuzzy-search capabilities of
<code>fzf</code>, I know I can do something like <code>cd $(fzf)</code> to almost
achieve what we’re looking for, however, that finds directories
and files, the latter of which we do not need. Luckily, we can
use a finder tool with <code>fzf</code> to get what we need. I’ll use <code>fd</code>
to achieve this:</p>
<pre><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>We are telling <code>fd</code> to just find directories, follow symbolic
links, allow hidden directories, but exclude the <code>.git</code>
directory. Luckily, <code>fd</code> already respects <code>.gitignore</code> so we do
not need to worry about dependencies or build files polluting
our search selection. Also, we are making it fancy with a
preview window of the selected directory’s contents.</p>
<p>I prefer to leave these as separate functions in case I want to
just jump to the Git repo root or jump to a sub-directoy within
the current directory. For the final <code>gg</code> command, we can just
use an alias:</p>
<pre><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>
<p>And that’s it. Here’s the full and final script:</p>
<pre><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to Git root
</span><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to sub-directory
</span><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to a directory within the current Git repository
</span><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p>Early on at Compression.ai, our main image compression algorithm used to look a lot more like most other Machine Learning (ML) based image compression algorithms — an auto-encoder. We had a branched neural network as the encoder, a branched neural network as the decoder, and an entropy coding module sandwiched in the middle. We then trained this whole network using the 1M ImageNet dataset, which contain just over 1 million images.</p>
<p>It was super simple. And it worked! Our model compressed images at 0.8 bit-per-pixel (bpp), while keeping the MS-SSIM over 0.99. Comparing against all the published work at the time, we were at the top in terms of visual quality to compression ratio. It was great, and we thought we had something.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*SlUT3YbVlYw0N6HF" alt="A typical auto-encoder" width="337" height="226"></p><p>Figure 1: A typical auto-encoder</p>
</div>
<p>But trying to get people to adapt a new file format was way harder than we originally thought, it was nearly impossible. No one wants to download a codec (that handles decompression) to open their images, even if it’s anything open source – let alone a proprietary one. We figured this out early on, and knew that if we were to make something substantial in the compression space, it had to be about taking an existing standard and improving on it, rather than creating a completely new one.</p>
<p>JPEG, first introduced to the world almost 3 decades ago, is still the most widely used image compression standard in the world. It is surprisingly simple, yet extremely effective. We figured if we needed to create something for the masses, it needed to be JPEG. This is when we began our work in improving JPEG with ML. In this blog post, I’ll detail the process we took, and how we ultimately created the best image compression algorithm there is.</p>
<h2>Enter JPEG</h2>
<p>To really understand how we can bring ML to JPEG, we’d need to start with JPEG itself and understand how JPEG compresses images. For a given image, the following explains how the JPEG algorithm works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the image is broken in to 8×8, non-overlapping blocks</li>
<li>Then for each 8×8 block, the algorithm:
<ul>
<li>Converts the color space to YUV</li>
<li>Performs subsampling on the UV channels (In case for 4:2:0 for example)</li>
<li>Applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</li>
<li>Quantizes using a Q-Table</li>
<li>Entropy codes to obtain a bit string</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lastly, this bit string (each per block of 8×8), together with metadata (such as the Q-Table) comprises the JPEG file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JPEG decoder, on the other hand, performs the above in reverse to reconstruct the image. If we take the output after quantization, perform de-quantization (basically by multiplying element-wise with the Q-Table) followed by an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), and convert the color space back to RGB, then we end up with 8×8 blocks of the original image. To go into more depth into how the JPEG compression works, refer to the following articles:</p>
<ol>
<li>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-jpg-works-a4dbd2316f35/</li>
<li>https://medium.com/breaktheloop/jpeg-compression-algorithm-969af03773da</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enter Machine Learning</h2>
<p>So how do we go about improving this process with Machine Learning? When you take a step back, you realize that the above computational steps can be executed in tensor-flowy fashion.&nbsp; Take an image, say of dimensions (a, b, 3), and create 8×8 patches of it (N, 8, 8, 3), N being the number of patches. (It helps if the image dimensions are divisible by 8, otherwise zero-padding would do. Anyway, details don’t matter much here, let’s focus image flow for now).&nbsp; On each 8×8 patch, we apply DCT, followed by a quantization step. A dequantization step&nbsp; followed by IDCT will yield back the original color space.</p>
<p>Now, if we had trainable parameters, we can imagine this process as a flow of a tensor, and use a framework like TensorFlow to code the model. You can then start training it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and optimize the network for MS-SSIM, for example.</p>
<p>Quantization in the JPEG algorithm consists of two operations. The first is to divide the numbers element-wise using a table commonly referred to as a Q-Table. This division is then followed by rounding to the nearest integer (to convert from floating-point numbers after DCT to integers in order to save space).</p>
<p>What we realized was, all the meaningful compression in the JPEG algorithm happens at this Quantization step – it is when the output of the DCT gets divided by the Q-Table. If we then use a neural network to approximate the best Q-Table possible, while guaranteeing a minimum MS-SSIM score, we have a winner.</p>
<p>Compression.ai’s newest JPEG compression engine was built using this concept. At its heart, we have a neural network outputting the best Q-Table guaranteeing the smallest output files size for the highest MS-SSIM score, tailored for each and every input image. A super fast implementation of the traditional JPEG compression algorithm is then used to create the final output image file.</p>
<p>So there you go. There’s a peak into the machine learning side of our algorithms.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"encoding/xml"</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>

    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is - <span><span>(?i)\bcat\b</span></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>

    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

</div>
<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

Over the past decade, the field has experienced staggering growth, at a rate of more than 20% per year, printing pieces that range from aircraft components and car parts to medical and dental implants out of metals and engineering polymers. One of the most widely used manufacturing processes, selective laser sintering (SLS), prints parts out of micron-scale material powders using a laser: the laser heats the particles to the point where they fuse together to form a solid mass.</p><p>“Additive manufacturing is key to economic resilience,” say <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.columbia.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fhod-lipson&amp;t=NzAyODc2ZDcyMDg3MjkyZTNlZGFlNzhjZjFhM2Y5MThlY2EwZmYzZSxSZUtKazNaTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624923909627805696%2Flaser-inversion-3d-printing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596169089">Hod Lipson</a>, James and Sally Scapa Professor of Innovation (<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fme.columbia.edu%2F&amp;t=NmI2MGJiZThmODBlNDFiYzI0NWM3YzhiZWVlZjIyODEyZDhmZmNmYixSZUtKazNaTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624923909627805696%2Flaser-inversion-3d-printing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596169089">Mechanical Engineering</a>). “All of us care about this technology—it’s going to save us. But there’s a catch.”</p><p>The catch is that SLS technologies have been limited to printing with a single material at a time: the entire part has to be made of just that one powder. “Now, let me ask you,” Lipson continues, “how many products are made of just one material? The limitations of printing in only one material has been haunting the industry and blocking its expansion, preventing it from reaching its full potential.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Wondering how to solve this challenge, Lipson and his PhD student John Whitehead used their expertise in robotics to develop a new approach to overcome these SLS limitations. By inverting the laser so that it points upwards, they invented a way to enable SLS to use—at the same time—multiple materials. Their working prototype, along with a print sample that contained two different materials in the same layer, was <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.addma.2020.101440&amp;t=MTQ2NDg2NDc0Nzg1MzQ4NDk5MDRmMGE2MGZkNGM2N2Q2M2U0MTMwMSxSZUtKazNaTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624923909627805696%2Flaser-inversion-3d-printing&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596169089">recently published online</a> by <i>Additive Manufacturing</i> as part of its December 2020 issue.</p><p>“Our initial results are exciting,” says Whitehead, the study’s lead author, “because they hint at a future where any part can be fabricated at the press of a button, where objects ranging from simple tools to more complex systems like robots can be removed from a printer fully formed, without the need for assembly.”</p><p>Selective laser sintering traditionally has involved fusing together material particles using a laser pointing downward into a heated print bed. A solid object is built from the bottom up, with the printer placing down a uniform layer of powder and using the laser to selectively fuse some material in the layer. The printer then deposits a second layer of powder onto the first layer, the laser fuses new material to the material in the previous layer, and the process is repeated over and over until the part is completed.</p><p>This process works well if there is just one material used in the printing process. But using multiple materials in a single print has been very challenging, because once the powder layer is deposited onto the bed, it cannot be unplaced, or replaced with a different powder.</p><p>“Also,” adds Whitehead, “in a standard printer, because each of the successive layers placed down are homogeneous, the unfused material obscures your view of the object being printed, until you remove the finished part at the end of the cycle. Think about excavation and how you can’t be sure the fossil is intact until you completely remove it from the surrounding dirt. This means that a print failure won’t necessarily be found until the print is completed, wasting time and money.”</p><p>The researchers decided to find a way to eliminate the need for a powder bed entirely. They set up multiple transparent glass plates, each coated with a thin layer of a different plastic powder. They lowered a print platform onto the upper surface of one of the powders, and directed a laser beam up from below the plate and through the plate’s bottom. This process selectively sinters some powder onto the print platform in a pre-programmed pattern according to a virtual blueprint. The platform is then raised with the fused material, and moved to another plate, coated with a different powder, where the process is repeated. This allows multiple materials to either be incorporated into a single layer, or stacked. Meanwhile, the old, used-up plate is replenished.</p><p>In the paper, the team demonstrated their working prototype by generating a 50 layer thick, 2.18mm sample out of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) powder with an average layer height of 43.6 microns and a multi-material nylon and TPU print with an average layer height of 71 microns. These parts demonstrated both the feasibility of the process and the capability to make stronger, denser materials by pressing the plate hard against the hanging part while sintering.</p><p>“This technology has the potential to print embedded circuits, electromechanical components, and even robot components. It could make machine parts with graded alloys, whose material composition changes gradually from end to end, such as a turbine blade with one material used for the core and different material used for the surface coatings,” Lipson notes. “We think this will expand laser sintering towards a wider variety of industries by enabling the fabrication of complex multi-material parts without assembly. In other words, this could be key to moving the additive manufacturing industry from printing only passive uniform parts, towards printing active integrated systems.”</p><p>The researchers are now experimenting with metallic powders and resins in order to directly generate parts with a wider range of mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties than is possible with conventional SLS systems today.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;Laser beam transmitting upwards through glass.

                <section>
                    <p>Aaron Tilley of the Wall Street Journal has an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-forces-businesses-to-confront-cloud-computing-costs-11595849519">interesting piece</a> (paywalled) today that speaks to one of the challenges that businesses are facing on the pandemic related technology front. The net of it is that companies are spending more and more on cloud costs, sometimes independent of their business outcomes. It doesn't compute long term. <br></p><p>More importantly, we think this moment signals a shift, with the pendulum swinging in the direction of the private cloud. The direction of repatriation. &nbsp;<br></p><p>We are not suggesting that the public cloud is a phenomenon. On the contrary, it has established itself as one of the foundational components of the enterprise technology stack. It is a multi-billion dollar business for nearly a dozen companies, led most famously by the exceptionally talented and driven team at Amazon. Their web services business generates $40 billion per year, and while the S3 business represents the lion’s share of the revenue, there are valuable services that continue to proliferate, reducing AWS’s exposure to that line of business.</p><p>Why did the cloud become so ubiquitous so quickly?</p><ol><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – AWS and others made it simple to solve problems. Need compute? Done. Need storage? Done. Want to add to that storage? Done. Want to analyze the data inside that storage? Done. The public cloud dramatically reduced the friction associated with cloud and shifted the balance of power to the developer community and away from IT.</li><li><strong>Elasticity</strong> – The public cloud offered a novel model: pay for what you need, when you need it. The concept of spinning up storage and compute and then spinning it down was entirely new and offered an attractive alternative to sunk costs and over-provisioning.</li><li><strong>A Microservices Mentality</strong> – One of the least appreciated implications of the cloud is that it came ready with an unbelievably rich catalog of applications, services and APIs that dramatically accelerated the development of data rich applications.</li></ol><p>While these themes powered the rise of the public cloud, they are not fundamentally competitive differentiators. That is to say, that the same attributes can be replicated on other public cloud options and more notably the private cloud, with a number of other benefits. Specifically, on the private cloud you get:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Security</strong> – While the public cloud offers an increasing array of security options, it suffers from some key gaps, namely complexity and management.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> – As we have noted in many of our <a href="https://blog.min.io/tag/benchmarks/">benchmark papers</a>, the public cloud is plenty fast. Object storage is the primary storage platform in the public cloud for a reason: it offers superior throughput, albeit higher latency. For data-rich applications and analytics, this is the ideal tradeoff. In the private cloud, proximity comes into play and delivers better performance than the public cloud at a fraction of the cost. This is a function of how expensive bandwidth is compared to storage.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> – Ultimately, the public cloud, for all its benefits, doesn’t deliver cost saving at scale. This is what is driving the <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3532030/cloud-repatriation-rescues-cios-from-mounting-costs.html">repatriation phenomenon</a> for large enterprises and keeping other ones <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-americas-350-million-internal-cloud-bet-striking-payoff-2019-10?IR=T">out of the cloud.</a> The ease of spinning up an instance, coupled with the ease of forgetting about it, results in massive bills. If your enterprise is dealing with petabytes the economics favor the private cloud.</li></ol><p>Having said that there are some good reasons a company <em><strong>should</strong></em> move the public cloud. The answer is to learn. To develop cloud-native muscle. To change the DNA of your organization.</p><p>Once you have achieved that, you come back to the private cloud – to run your business at scale. Let’s explore that concept a little further:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Out of Your Comfort Zone</strong> – There are a number of skills you will never learn from sliding another blade into the rack and seeing it come up on your “single pane of glass”. This is not an insult to IT admins, as they have significant amounts of tribal knowledge that are immensely valuable. Further, the success of the blade vendors is predicated on making things simple. None of those blade vendors want to talk about Kubernetes, containers or programming skills or databases - but those are the components of the public cloud and they have to be mastered. What better place to do it than the cloud, where sampling different software solutions is as easy as cruising the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Cloud-Native Muscle</strong> – The cloud-native mentality is fundamentally different from the traditional IT mentality. The traditional IT mentality is about hardware appliances, integration testing, validation and labs. The cloud-native mentality is about software, applications, containerization, orchestration, APIs and microservices. The cloud-native way is to rapidly assemble infrastructure, applications and workflows, and then deploy that in the service of a business problem. The cloud-native way is the future. Kubernetes is the dominant model in the build/package/deploy framework. It was designed for the cloud-native world that we now live in. These are the skills that a modern enterprise needs to develop. Learning them in the traditional IT framework makes no sense. Moving to the cloud demands that the organization master the cloud-native skill set because that is the only skill set that works there.</li><li><strong>Understand Scaling</strong> – In the public cloud, simple scales, failure domains are kept small and building blocks represent the way things are built. Massive, monolithic systems don’t exist. Massive systems exist, just ask the CIOs with 8-figure AWS bills, but they are composed of smaller blocks. The basic premise of cloud-native architecture, whether it is for compute or storage, is to consume resources in small, discrete chunks. As you scale, you add additional instances and pack them as densely as possible in your infrastructure instead of scaling one instance up infinitely.</li><li><strong>Internalize Simplicity</strong> – One of the great gifts of the cloud is simplicity: the ability to <a href="https://min.io/pricing">start with a credit card</a>, to provision infrastructure with a click of the mouse, to add products and services. Simple wins in the cloud. For too long, IT used complexity as a method of control. Only certain, credentialed and certified individuals were given the keys to the castle. In the cloud, simple wins. If your app or service is simple to provision and deploy, more people will adopt it. Like water, consumers choose the path of least resistance. Simple does not mean lacking in features or power. Simple is often more powerful than complex – it just takes more effort to deliver the experience. Simplicity democratizes data. Every organization wants to democratize data – they need to learn its secrets and apply them at scale.</li></ul><p>Good? Now apply at scale.<br></p><p>As noted, the public cloud is an amazing place to learn but not an amazing place to scale – unless of course, you are the landlord (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba). The place to scale is on the private cloud, using the same technologies that you used on the public cloud: S3 storage, dense compute, high-speed networking, Kubernetes, containers and microservices. <br></p><p>This offers the ideal mix of operational costs, flexibility and control. It is true that you will take on CapEx, but by starting small and taking advantage of key cloud lessons (elasticity and scaling by components) enterprises can minimize the initial outlay and maximize the operationational savings.<br></p><p>The net effect is to drive superior TCO and ROI through the private cloud. <br></p><p>So go to the public cloud and learn the “way of the cloud” then apply it on-prem. That is where the economics, control and security reign supreme. <br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to join YC for the last 8 years. I've applied to and been rejected by YC three times.</p><p>But when we got into YC with <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a>, we turned it down. Here’s why…</p><h2 id="yc-as-an-employee">YC as an Employee</h2><p>I first learned about YC in 2012 from <a href="https://twitter.com/zebulgar">a friend</a> who was obsessed with startups. Soon, all of my smartest friends were dropping out of school to do YC. In 2014, I joined them by bailing on an internship to work for <a href="http://picnichealth.com/">Picnic Health</a> as they went through YC S14.</p><p>That summer I lived in a house in Redwood City with the rest of the team. YC forced us to focus and make progress each week. This culminated in Demo Day which allowed us to raise a seed round without much real traction.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_8nvbj2oFDnwe9iRc.jpg" alt="The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF."><figcaption>The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF.</figcaption></figure><p>At my mom's urging, I left Picnic Health to finish college, but that summer left a lasting impression. After graduating and joining <a href="http://benchling.com/">Benchling</a> (another YC startup), I watched jealously as friends started companies and got into YC.</p><h2 id="rejected-rejected-rejected-accepted">Rejected, Rejected, Rejected, Accepted</h2><p>After leaving Benchling to start my own company, I quickly learned that starting a company was much harder than expected. I applied to YC and got rejected. Rinse and repeat. I ended up starting 3 companies and getting rejected from YC three times.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_eGdhBVmpHcqwD4nj.png" alt="Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with Scooter Map."><figcaption>Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with <a href="https://scootermap.com/">Scooter Map</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This March, as COVID spread in the US, I stayed up late talking with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danqing_liu">Danqing</a> about what we could do to help. From these conversations, we built <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a> to help <a href="https://zmurl.com/whit2">a friend of mine</a> sell tickets to her Zoom Yoga classes.</p><p>In just a week, ZmURL went from an idea to being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">featured on TechCrunch</a>. To keep up with the growth, we focused on building product 7 days a week. For one weekend we took a break to lift our heads up, talk about the future, and to apply to YC.</p><p>To my surprise, after getting rejected three times, we got into YC for the current batch. Even more surprisingly, after weighing our options, we decided to turn down YC.</p><p>I realized that we applied to YC just because it was "the thing to do" and that YC is no longer the right fit for every startup. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_dTo3agVed4ANcClE.png" alt="The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever."><figcaption>The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-benefits-of-yc">The Benefits of YC</h2><p>Before explaining why we turned down YC, it's helpful to know what makes YC so awesome. From going thru YC with Picnic Health, YC helped us with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — Learn how to startup. Attend inspirational dinners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — You're forced to deliver results every week. Compete with your batchmates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network</strong> — Bond with other smart founders. Reach out to YC alums</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — YC is cool, it's cool to be part of YC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you are selling to startups, YC is full of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — Demo Day builds buzz and FOMO.</p></li></ul><h2 id="yc-without-yc">YC Without YC</h2><p>Today, many of these benefits can be gained without joining YC while other aspects of YC have gotten worse due to the increased the batch size.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — YC has open sourced <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/">Startup Class</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — Write a <a href="https://victor.pont.is/article/weekly-update">weekly update</a> to friends or post your progress to Twitter.</p></li><li><div><p><strong>Network</strong> — Join an early stage startup. Meet interesting people online.</p><p>I was able to build an invaluable network of mentors over the past 5 years working at startups and starting companies in San Francisco. I've made interesting friends from posting on Twitter and reaching out just to chat with interesting people. (See Tweet below.)</p></div></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — You can build a personal brand by writing online, but the YC brand is very good.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you aren't selling to startups, you don't benefit as much from YC’s network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — From the founders I've talked to, the first remote Demo Day failed. This could have been due to COVID, so it'll be interesting to see how the next Demo Day goes...</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_3qWItqVzC2aoeI6N.png" alt="I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL."><figcaption>I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter. In March, this Tweet led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">Techcrunch covering the launch of ZmURL</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="who-should-do-yc">Who Should do YC</h2><p>YC is still the best tech accelerator and they are doing amazing work to make starting companies more accessible. YC is a great fit for you if are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Tech Outsider</strong> — YC helps you meet other founders and can introduce you to any VC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selling to Startups</strong> — Stripe, Segment, Gusto, and Brex grew quickly by selling to other YC companies. As a YC founder, it's easy to reach out to alums and pitch them, although this is getting worse as the large batch sizes dilute the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hungry for Prestige</strong> — YC used to be for outsiders. "Why would you start a company instead of work for Google?" But now joining YC is cool, so it's a valuable stop on the Harvard → McKinsey → MBA trajectory. (This has also contributed to YC's dilution.)</p></li></ul><p>While increasing the batch size is the right thing for YC (and for the world), it's made the experience worse for founders who get less facetime with partners and end up directly competing with batchmates. While YC told us there wouldn't be competitors in our batch, we've already seen at least 3 very similar companies in the current YC batch...</p><p>After weighing our options, we decided to skip YC and to try to raise a seed round. I'll talk about how that went in my next post...</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>Today we are going to talk about some of my favorite tips, which are super easy to implement or to follow, and that can make your JavaScript code cleaner. Also keep in mind some of the things we are going to learn today apply to JavaScript in general, though the article will focus on React.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="object-destructuring">Object destructuring</h2>
<p>To get started we will review object destructuring, one of my favorites actually, that can help to keep the code small, clean, and elegant. This topic I love so much that I actually made a whole post about it here: <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-15-write-cleaner-code-by-using-javascript-destructuring/">Write Cleaner Code By Using JavaScript Destructuring</a>.
Destructuring allows you to break down complex structures into simpler parts. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> { <span>title</span> } <span>=</span> <span>props</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>title</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>A common place where React developers use this technique is with props. Though some people may argue that you lose context when you split the variables, it is usually the case in React, that the context is inherited by the component itself. Let’s take a look at an example to show what I mean.</p>
<p>First, let’s write a simple component to show Task information on the screen:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="react"><span>function</span> <span>TaskView</span>(<span>props</span>) {
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;{<span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>title</span>}&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;{<span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>description</span>}&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;{<span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>}&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>It is indeed very simple, however, look at how we repeat props all the time, not very pretty. Let’s look at another way to implement this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="react"><span>function</span> <span>TaskView</span>(<span>props</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>task</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;{<span>task</span>.<span>title</span>}&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;{<span>task</span>.<span>description</span>}&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;{<span>task</span>.<span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>}&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s a bit better but still, we have tasks everywhere. Now someone who perhaps doesn’t know destructuring may be tempted to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>title</span>
<span>const</span> <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>.<span>description</span>
</code></pre></div><p>which adds too much overhead to the declarations. Let’s now see how the component looks like when using destructuring.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="react"><span>function</span> <span>TaskView</span>(<span>props</span>) {
    <span>const</span> { <span>title</span>, <span>description</span>, <span>completed</span> } <span>=</span> <span>props</span>.<span>task</span>
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;{<span>title</span>}&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;{<span>description</span>}&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;{<span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>}&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now the code is very simple, we keep the JSX very clean from the rest, and we are still in context. It’s perfectly understandable that when we say <code>title</code> we are talking about the <code>Task</code> as is what the component is all about. So keep your names clean, and structure well your components and you will love this feature.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="simplify-your-conditional-statements">Simplify your conditional statements</h2>
<p>In this section, I want to talk about 3 different scenarios that can help us increase the readability of our code, and it’s so easy, though many times we forget to do it.</p>
<h3 id="conditional-execution">Conditional execution</h3>
<p>It is normal that at some point we need to run a statement only if a certain condition happens to be true. Usually, it goes something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>if</span> (<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>)) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong with that code, however, it can be simplified a bit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Nice, but how does it work? JavaScript as many other languages, read conditional statements such us <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> in order from left to right, and they exit at the time they can invalidate the arguments.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of this with all conditionals:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>t</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>t</span> <span>===</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>t</span> <span>===</span> <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In that example, JS will first take the first expression <code>t === 1</code>, since that expression is truthy and we have an <code>and</code> conditional, it needs to evaluate the next expression, as we need to guarantee they are all truthy. When it evaluates <code>t === 2</code>, which is falsy, it doesn’t need to evaluate <code>t === 3</code> at all, it can save that compute as we know the whole statement happens to be <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Amazing! now let’s learn something more about this. It is very common on the internet to see examples of this, however, did you know you can also use the <code>||</code> operator as well?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>||</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>) <span>// does not execute the console.log
</span><span></span><span>isFive</span>(<span>10</span>) <span>||</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is not the number five!'</span>) <span>// it executes the console.log
</span></code></pre></div><p>Did you notice that what we just did would be equivalent to apply a not to our first example?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>isFive</span> <span>=</span> (<span>num</span>) =&gt; <span>num</span> <span>===</span> <span>5</span>
<span>isFive</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is the number five!'</span>) <span>// it executes the console.log
</span><span></span><span>!</span><span>isFive</span>(<span>10</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'It is not the number five!'</span>) <span>// it executes the console.log
</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="ternary-operator">Ternary operator</h3>
<p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.</p>
<p>This is very commonly used to show different statuses or components to the user depending on a conditional statement. Though I don’t always recommend to use the ternary operator, sometimes a good old fashion if does the job very well. It can be extremely useful for small things.</p>
<p>Take a look a the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>completed</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'Completed'</span>
} <span>else</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>'Pending'</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Another variation of that, which I still see around is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>completed</span>) { <span>return</span> <span>'Completed'</span>} <span>else</span> { <span>return</span> <span>'Pending'</span> }
</code></pre></div><p>I’m not here to judge, but that can get real messy. Let’s take a look at a way using the ternary operator</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>return</span> <span>completed</span> <span>?</span> <span>'Completed'</span> <span>:</span> <span>'Pending'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Much nicer!</p>
<h3 id="optional-chaining">Optional Chaining</h3>
<p>Last but not least, we have optional chaining (<code>?.</code>) that allows reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate each reference.</p>
<p>In plain English, it helps to avoid a bunch of <code>if</code> statements just to make sure we have a value on a nested property. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>juan</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Juan'</span>,
    <span>marriedTo</span><span>:</span> {
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Diana'</span>
    }
}

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>marriedTo</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// Diana
</span><span></span><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ups…. when we tried to access the name of the person we are divorced from, we get an error, because <code>divorcedFrom</code> in our case is undefined. Normally we would solve it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span>.<span>name</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>But that can also get out of hands by adding a lot of ifs just for this purpose. There is a better way using optional chaining.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>juan</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Juan'</span>,
    <span>marriedTo</span><span>:</span> {
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>'Diana'</span>
    }
}

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>marriedTo</span><span>?</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// Diana
</span><span></span><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>juan</span>.<span>divorcedFrom</span><span>?</span>.<span>name</span>) <span>// undefined
</span></code></pre></div><p>And this can apply to multiple levels</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>juan</span>.<span>marriedTo</span><span>?</span>.<span>disvorcedFrom</span><span>?</span>.<span>kids</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Very nice! Let’s move on with the next topic.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="spread-operator">Spread Operator</h2>
<p>There is no React app without making use of the spread operator, maybe that’s exaggerated, but the spread operator is widely used in react applications, especially when working with reducers, though it is much more than just for that. This is another topic which I covered extensively in the article <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-05-23-how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript/">How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript</a>. I really recommend that you read it, it’s pretty cool and covers the topic in detail.</p>
<p>The spread operator allows you to expand an iterable object into a list of its individual elements. Let’s better take a look into some examples:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>x</span>, <span>y</span>, <span>z</span>) {
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
}

<span>const</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>=</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>sum</span>(...<span>numbers</span>)) <span>// 6
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, what we are doing is to transform an <code>array</code> into separate variables that are passed to our <code>sum</code> function. It’s a pretty neat trick. But we can also apply it for objects:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>obj1</span> <span>=</span> { <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'bar'</span>, <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>42</span> }
<span>const</span> <span>obj2</span> <span>=</span> { <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'baz'</span>, <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>13</span> }

<span>const</span> <span>copyObj1</span> <span>=</span> { ...<span>obj1</span> } <span>// This copies all the properties of obj1 into a new object.
</span><span></span>
<span>const</span> <span>merged</span> <span>=</span> { ...<span>obj1</span>, ...<span>obj2</span> } <span>// This merges all the properties of obj1 and obj2 into a new object.
</span><span></span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>merged</span>) <span>// {foo: "baz", x: 42, y: 13}
</span></code></pre></div><p>Because we can use this to create new objects or arrays, its ideal to use with Redux, as we can avoid mutating the original objects.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="template-literals">Template Literals</h2>
<p>Though very popular and beginners friendly, no list would be completed without them. Template literals are basically strings, but not any string, they allow embedded expressions. Let’s take a look.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`this is a string literal`</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>In its more basic form, a string literal is just a string, however, note that for it to be a string literal it must use <code>`</code> instead of <code>"</code> or <code>'</code>. It’s a small detail but makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>String literals, for example, support multi-line strings:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`line 1
</span><span>line 2`</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Or you can also embed expressions</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`a: </span><span>${</span><span>a</span><span>}</span><span> and b: </span><span>${</span><span>b</span><span>}</span><span> but more importantly a+b = </span><span>${</span><span>a</span><span>+</span><span>b</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>) <span>// a: 10 and b: 25 but more importantly a+b = 35
</span></code></pre></div><p>Really cool!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>JavaScript is packed with useful operators, expressions and tricks to power up our development skills, and writer cleaner code. It is also true that some of the things I mention can be personal judgment, but if you look at the React code written on very popular projects you will see they apply these small things all over the place. So they are really good to learn and implement when you write your next React component.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://numinous.productions/timeful/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://numinous.productions/timeful/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>The most powerful books reach beyond their pages—beyond those few hours in which they’re read—and indelibly transform how serious readers see the world. Few books achieve such transcendent impact, yet given their physical constraints, it’s remarkable that any do. As a medium, books have no direct means of communicating with readers over time. The physical text is stuck on the page, generally read linearly and continuously in a few sittings.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat. Unfortunately, readers must drive that process for themselves. Authors can’t easily guide this ongoing sense-making: their words are stuck on pages which have already been read. How might one create a medium which does the job of a book, but which escapes a book’s shackled sense of time? How might one create <em>timeful texts</em>—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?</p>
			
			<p>Each year, hundreds of thousands of students study <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em>. The text presents endless facts and figures, but its goal is not simply to transmit reference material. The book aspires to convey a strong sense of how to think like a cell biologist—a way of looking at questions, at phenomena, and at oneself. For example, it contains nuanced discussions of microscopy techniques, but readers can’t meaningfully try on those ways of thinking while they’re reading. Readers must carry this book’s ideas into their daily interactions in the lab, watching for moments which relate to the exercises or which give meaning to the authors’ advice.<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat1.png" role="presentation"> This model of change is brittle: the right situation must arise while the book is still fresh in readers’ minds; they must notice the relevance of the situation; they must remember the book’s details; they must reflect on their experience and how it relates to the book’s ideas; and so on.</p>
			<p>As we consider alternative approaches, we can find inspiration in the world’s most transformative books. Consider texts like the Bible and the Analects of Confucius. People integrate ideas from those books into their lives over time—but not because authors designed them that way. Those books work because they’re surrounded by rich cultural activity. Weekly sermons and communities of practice keep ideas fresh in readers’ minds and facilitate ongoing connections to lived experiences. This is a powerful approach for powerful texts, requiring extensive investment from readers and organizers. We can’t build cathedrals for every book. Sophisticated readers adopt similar methods to study less exalted texts, but most people lack the necessary skills, drive, and cultural contexts. How might we design texts to more widely enable such practices?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat2.png" role="presentation">
			<p>Guided meditation smartphone apps offer a promising design approach. Meditation’s insights unfold slowly. Aspirants are typically advised to practice daily. Over weeks and months, they may begin to experience the world differently. Some concepts in meditation make no sense if you still can’t perceive your breath clearly, so they’re best introduced later. A book on meditation isn’t well-suited to this kind of slow unfurling: much of it may not make sense initially; readers will need to re-read it again and again as their practice progresses. But a guided meditation app’s experience is naturally spread over time. Each day’s session begins and ends with brief instruction. Instructors offer topical prompts throughout the practice. Intermittent repetition can keep old ideas active in students’ minds until they’re ready to engage. Rather than delivering a bound monograph on meditation, instructors can slowly unfurl an idea over hundreds of days. Critically, these apps are a mass medium, just as books are: lessons can be “written” once and redistributed cheaply to huge audiences. Could this approach be applied more generally?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat3.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To engage with a book’s ideas over time, readers must remember its details, and <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books">that’s already a challenge</a>. One promising solution lies in <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition memory systems</a>, which allow users to retain large quantities of knowledge reliably and efficiently. Like meditation, these systems involve a daily practice: every day, a reader maintains their memory library by reviewing a few dozen lightweight prompts. Each prompt asks a detailed question, like “What types of stimuli does George Miller’s span of absolute judgment describe?” Each day’s session is different because each prompt repeats on its own schedule. When a user remembers or forgets the answer to a prompt, the system expands or contracts that prompt’s repetition interval along an exponential curve. These expanding intervals allow readers to maintain a collection of thousands of prompts while reviewing only a few dozen each day. Practitioners generally complete their review sessions in moments which would otherwise go unused, like when waiting in line.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/timeline.png" alt="This figure illustrates pages of a book being presented along a timeline of expanding intervals.">
			<p>Despite their efficacy, these systems are not yet widely adopted. One important barrier to adoption is that it’s surprisingly difficult to write good prompts. To explore one potential solution, we created an experimental quantum computing textbook, <em><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a></em>. It’s written in a “<a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">mnemonic medium</a>,” interleaving expert-authored spaced repetition prompts into the reading experience. Our goal was to help readers engage with challenging technical material by supporting their memory. <img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat2.png" role="presentation">As we interviewed readers, though, we noticed that the regular review sessions didn’t just build detailed retention: the ongoing practice also changed readers’ relationship to the material by maintaining their contact with it over time. These people didn’t just read the book once and proceed with their lives. <em>Quantum Country</em>’s review sessions returned readers to its ideas again and again over weeks and months.</p>
			<p><em>Quantum Country</em>’s prompts are designed to help readers remember technical material, but it may be possible to adapt similar mechanisms to support future timeful texts.</p>
			<p>Consider <em>The Elements of Style</em>, a classic writing primer by Strunk and White. The authors demonstrate the value of parallel construction with this example from the Bible: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” But it’s not enough to read an example. Good writers’ ears become automatically alert to these constructions. They notice opportunities to create parallelisms, and they notice dissonance when similar phrases are presented differently. It takes time to develop this awareness.</p>
			<p>What if, a week after learning about parallel construction, a reader’s review session included this prompt?</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The following quote has been modified to remove a parallel construction. How might you rewrite it to add parallel construction? How do the two differ in effect?</p>
				<p>“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Instead, reflect on what you can contribute to these United States.” (modified from a quote by John F. Kennedy, which would be revealed in its original form once the reader had finished with the prompt)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A week or two later, a similar prompt might appear with a different distorted quote. For example: “You can fool all the people some of the time, and you can mislead many listeners consistently. But you won’t be able to fool everyone reliably.” (adapted from Abraham Lincoln)</p>
			<p>Such prompts might seem onerous or strange on their own, but what if most educated people maintained a regular review practice of the kind we’ve described? The example reflection prompt would sit between others on physics, poetry, and whatever else you’d been thinking about. If you found the prompt useful, it would recur in another week; if not, perhaps it would reappear in a few months. A book like <em>The Elements of Style</em> might include dozens or hundreds of prompts like these on various topics, so that you’d see one or two each day over weeks and months as you integrate its ideas into the way you view and practice writing.</p>
			<p>In early chapters of <em>Quantum Country</em>, readers see every prompt as they read the text, and the prompts remain the same in the ensuing review sessions. But in the final chapter, we added a new kind of prompt which changes over time in a programmed sequence. Perhaps future timeful texts could unfurl their contents over the course of many sessions, much as we observed that digital meditation lessons do.</p>
			<p>Of course, spaced repetition is just one approach for writing timeful texts. What other powerful tools might it be possible to create, making future books into artifacts that transcend their pages, as they slowly help readers shape their lives?</p>

One even sees increasing talk about the need for better online social networks — ones that foster positive human experience and development, reasonable thinking and imaginative creation.</p><p id="a079">What I haven’t yet seen, however, is much real understanding of why our current online social networks are the way they are, and what might be done to fix them.</p><p id="46c1">What we need to create a better social network, in my view, is relatively straightforward to state:</p><p id="eb94"><strong>1.</strong> Code should be open source.</p><p id="e4af"><strong>2. </strong>Ownership and control should be decentralized… so there is no company and no government tasked and burdened with calling all the shots. Embedding blockchain technologies deep in the technical design of the network is the right way to achieve this.</p><p id="f752"><strong>3.</strong> Major decisions should be made democratically. If some group systematically doesn’t like the outcomes votes are getting, they can fork the code and make a new version, or copy the code and create a new network using the same software.</p><p id="d04a"><strong>4.</strong> Recommendations of connections and content should be made using AI that has the ability to explain the reasons behind its judgments — and these explanations need to be shown routinely to users in a way they can understand.</p><p id="c2c7">Due to SingularityNET and a variety of other recent developments, we already have the basic technologies needed to support this sort of approach — as far as tech is concerned, we could have decentralized, democratic, transparent and ethical alternatives to Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and so forth right now. We even have some existing websites — such as <a href="http://minds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minds.com</a> — embodying significant parts of the above.</p><p id="ab48">What we still don’t have — yet! — is the alignment of resources to get alternatives fulfilling all four of the above points fully built-out … and then pushed toward wide adoption.</p><p id="6e32">In this essay, I’m going to dig a bit into the collective-psychology implications of current centralized social networks and future potential decentralized alternatives. Given the key role that social networks currently play in channelling, guiding and crystallizing collective human thought and emotion, these are not just issues regarding the infrastructure of a particular technology sector — they may actually be critical to the future path of humanity.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png" width="1288" height="709" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7b1f">The current mode of organizing social networks presents companies like Facebook with seemingly unsolvable problems. Should Facebook take down racist posts? What about posts with indirect racist implications? Posts explicitly aimed at affecting political elections using false information? What about questionable information? What makes information “too questionable”?</p><p id="5947">In relatively free regions like e.g. the US or Western Europe, government’s role in modulating public speech is restricted to extreme cases of directly dangerous speech (directly advocating violence, explicit forms of “hate speech” etc.). I believe this is for the best, as the alternative of giving government stronger control over speech has glaringly obvious failure modes — i.e. it can be used by fascist-minded government leaders to squelch the public dialogue needed to organize opposition to their rule.</p><p id="19e4">However, less extreme, less directly dangerous instances of public speaking can also have a dramatic and systematically destructive impact on individual minds and the public mind — and in the current situation in the “free world”, these are being modulated by corporations in a very ad hoc way. And these corporations, run by digital marketing and tech geek types, are wholly unsuited to the subtle problem of modulating online information, knowledge and relationship flow for humanity. These organizations are optimized for delivering software and delivering ads and making money — not for guiding the public mind toward the broader good.</p><p id="dfa8">On the positive side, there are all sorts of brilliant ideas and wonderful creations being put out there on the Internet every minute of every day — but most of these have a hard time finding the audience they deserve because most of the currently widely operational information dissemination mechanisms are oriented toward corporate profit maximization rather than general human (or transhuman!) benefit maximization.</p><p id="8343">So given that it’s best to keep governments out of the modulation of non-extreme, not-directly-dangerous public speech — and given also that corporations running social media networks are not well suited for the job — then what can we do?</p><p id="fb1f">What we can do, of course, is roll out information and relationship coordination systems that allow the community of individuals engaged in social networks to carry out intelligent information and relationship management themselves — via their explicit judgments and decisions, and their implicit actions.</p><p id="2b59">SingularityNET’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation system</a> is one tool designed to help with this — it provides a framework for leveraging data regarding user behaviours to estimate the reputation or value that a given user assigned to another person or an information source or piece of information. Using tools like this, each person guides what information they see, based on AI algorithms calibrated for their own benefit rather than the benefit of corporations seeking to profit from them.</p><p id="82b6">You can learn more this here <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation systems for marketplaces</a>, also on the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.singularitynet.io/computing-reputation-for-discourse-users-with-aigents-25b806277e74]">Discourse forums</a>.</p><p id="c6ed">But how can people know these AI algorithms are acting for their own benefit? Transparent and explainable AI is another key ingredient here. SingularityNET reputation system can leverage either opaque or transparent AI for making predictions of how much a given user will appreciate a given other person, source or datum. Embedding neural-symbolic AI into the reputation system is one strategy that can enable a reasonable degree of explainability, as symbolic patterns can generally be simplified and rearranged into explainable form via automated transformations.</p><p id="5a97">Creating analogues of modern social networks architected according to the above principles would not be incredibly hard given available technologies. There would be a lot of engineering required, but mankind is now capable of doing a lot of engineering.</p><p id="51c0">The essential reason fair and democratic and non-stupid large-scale social networks built along these lines do not exist, is that nobody with adequate financial resources has wanted to put in the money to build one.</p><p id="81c9">One may ask why such a thing hasn’t just been created by volunteer OSS developers or entrepreneurial devs. One core issue is that such a social network framework would only be valuable once it had a lot of users. Because of this, the reality or perception is that getting such a project off the ground at this stage — with huge entrenched centralized competitors — would require a massive marketing budget.</p><p id="fa00">I would love to see SingularityNET and OpenCog used as foundational tools for the implementation and operation of this sort of social network, and would welcome partnerships with other groups interested to collaborate on this sort of work.</p><p id="40ff">But what I want to explore a little more here in this article are some of the subtler reasons why <strong><em>transparency, explainability and decentralization are so important in social network construction</em></strong>.</p><p id="c6a9">I’m going to get a little theoretical here — but before long I’ll get back to the practical.</p><p id="9d73">How and why did our social networks become this way?</p><p id="d63e">Of course, the profit motive underlying the companies that build and operate these social networks — Facebook, Twitter and the rest — is part of the problem. The goal of the social network becomes maximum addictiveness because this is the most straightforward way to maximize profit in this particular business niche … and human psychology being what it is, the way to achieve maximum addictiveness is to appeal to a mix of emotions in a rather perverse way.</p><p id="df6a">Much as junk food perverts our taste and smell system to create unhealthy addictive food experiences of a sort that didn’t exist in the Paleolithic environment we evolved for, similarly, current social networks pervert our social, cognitive and emotional systems to create unhealthy addictive informational and relational experiences of a sort that didn’t exist before Internet tech came along.</p><p id="2f30">But the drive to profit from maximum addictiveness is only one of the more proximal aspects of the problem. The destructive perversity we see in modern social networks is a self-organizing phenomenon, which is fed by the drive on the part of social network designers to create addictive experiences but has additional special properties.</p><p id="17af">The nature of addiction is that: <strong><em>Not only is the addictive thing enjoyable, but its absence is painful … and the amount needed to get enjoyment keeps going up.</em></strong> So if you’re addicted to something, the more you use it, the more urgently you need to use it more… etc. in a feedback loop.</p><p id="220e">One may rephrase this as:<strong><em> The more an addictive thing is done, the less psychological energy it takes to do it again … and the more psychological energy it takes to not do it again.</em></strong></p><p id="a5c6">In a way addiction is a lot like long-term potentiation (LTP), a basic principle of learning in the brain — the more a synaptic connection between two neurons is used, the easier it gets for the charge to spread along that connection. I.e., the more that charge flows along with a connection, the less energy has to be spent to get a given amount of charge to the other end of that connection.</p><p id="d2d7">LTP in the brain — also known as “<a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Hebbian_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebbian learning</a>” after 1940s neural learning theorist Donald Hebb — leads to the formation of complex cell assemblies representing knowledge, ideas, behaviours and so forth. Similarly, addictive dynamics in social networks — addiction to messaging in particular groups, or to particular people, in particular …</p></div></div></section></div>

<figcaption>Ma Yuan, Scholar Viewing a Waterfall</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Georges Dumézil in his 1929 book Flamen-Brahman proposed that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social groups: The productive class, which practiced agriculture, pastoralism, and artisanship; the martial class, which waged war and defended the tribe; and the sovereign class, wielding authority both juridicial and spiritual, whose place it was to rule. As societies grew more complex and division of labor became more granular, further specializations came to be recognized, but they remained grounded in the original tripartite: worker, warrior, and priest.</p>

<p>The earliest incarnation of the priestly class made sense of the chaos of the natural world, locating agency in what appeared to be random processes. They performed rituals in an effort to beseech or control the spirits or gods that governed the land. They read the auspices by which the gods made their will known to mortals. They served as the memory of a people and enacted judgment against transgressors.</p>

<p>The priestly role is, in a word, systematization. Their chief purpose is to construct the reality in which their adherents live. They provide order and grounding, defining the base truths those of a society take axiomatically. It is on these axioms that all else is built.</p>

<p>It is customary to divide the history of communication into four periods: oral, manuscript, print, and electronic. Systems native to each period were in large part defined by the the means they provided to catalog and disseminate information. Writing enabled the development of institutions of knowledge unbound by the limits of memory and generational transmission, marking a shift from teaching and knowing to study and interpretation. Print allowed for texts to be distributed to the masses directly rather than dictated by an intermediary and enlisted their participation in the act of interpreting. The internet now is the means by which anyone may author and transmit their own texts unencumbered by previous physical constraints.</p>

<p>The Church in the manuscript era constructed a shared reality, a substratum of truth binding its members together and which they sought to recruit all peoples into, which we may call Christendom. The Reformation, waxing alongside print, irrevocably destroyed this framework; however, the Protestant faiths by nature could never provide the same unity of purpose. Instead, the writers who reformulated concepts such as rights and sovereignty such that they could stand alone, as axioms, laid the groundwork for the new reality to follow. In this way secularism, republicanism, and such can be seen neither as a salve for the century of bloodshed the Reformation inaugurated, nor as the culmination of the ideas Luther put forward. Rather, they formed a distinct set of beliefs competing for and eventually winning preeminence in lands Catholic and Protestant alike over a longer, multi-century period of religious war. This worldview likewise energizes its adherents to spread it across the globe, and it remains the most powerful and widespread meaning-making system to this day, commanding the mass of peoples that we may call the Public.</p>

<p>With the internet, we are in the early stages of its destruction. The trend from the rotary press to the television was cohesion, toward a unitary Public. The trend for the past two and a half decades has been one of fragmentation, a diffusion of various publics. Just as the Church formed the basis of people's understanding of themselves and the society they lived in in the era of the manuscript, and the press did the same in the era of print, a new mode is emerging shaped by present technology.</p>

<p>The major platforms at present incentivize the profusion of cloistered micro-communities, exchanging ideas among themselves and with their immediate neighbors that come to form their own realities inscrutable to outsiders. This is not a necessary consequence of the underlying technology, but rather the result of design decisions made by the programmers who author these systems. Discourse over how platforms "ought" to function tends to focus on a tension between the desire of tech companies to operate as simple businesses disinterested in higher questions against a perceived necessity for them to fill the role once occupied by the press as defenders of liberal democracy. This framing, however, misses the wealth of options available beyond letting events run their course or stemming the unwinding of the present order. A programmer class conscious of its potential to fill the now-vacant priestly role could leverage this position for arbitrary ends, design its systems to shape the reality of its choosing. Whether one finds this intriguing or frightening is a matter of taste.</p>

<p>❧</p>

<p>Before there was writing, there was speech. Orality is best regarded as a technology in its own right, with its own techniques and affordances. In contrast to a common view of oral culture as necessarily egalitarian and collaborative, the priestly role, concerned with narration and preservation of societal memory, was a specialized one. The guru-shishya system of preserving the Vedas was the most highly developed form and serves as a testament to the possibility for thoroughness without relying on the written word. Students learned various recitations, or pathas, of the corpus—continuous, word-by-word, with or without euphonic combinations—and their consonance served as a built-in form of error-checking. Phonology was standardized as the Vedic pitch accent, sidestepping the problem many traditions have with linguistic drift. Putting the Vedas to paper was later done almost as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Most cultures were not nearly as thorough or organized, however, and over time many traditions drifted or diverged from their original forms. Especially in times of upheaval, there are no caches of texts to rediscover after the crisis abates. Tellers must simply make do with what they are given, and indeed the kernel of a shared tradition can often be found in wildly divergent bodies of knowledge from cultures cleaved from each other by distance, war, or time.</p>

<p>The advent of written language allowed oral cultures to be centralized and canonized, relieving the burdens and lossiness of memory. Traditions were made into texts, singular and authoritative. Externalizing memory to papyrus or parchment enormously expanded the scope of what could be retained. It also eliminated the necessity for exactitude and endless repetition when instructing students, allowing for a stronger focus on meaning and interpretation.</p>

<p>Socrates called writing "the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom" in a dialogue with Phaedrus, remarking that it enabled surface-level understandings and made up for deficiencies of recall. He goes on however to make a rather subtler point:</p>

<blockquote> Writing, Phaedrus, has this strange quality, and is very like painting; for the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they spoke as if they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing. And every word, when once it is written, is bandied about, alike among those who understand and those who have no interest in it, and it knows not to whom to speak or not to speak; when ill-treated or unjustly reviled it always needs its father to help it; for it has no power to protect or help itself.</blockquote>

<p>Writing, he argues, cannot elaborate on its meaning any further than what is written, a quality unlike that of a speaker. But where Socrates sees this as an objective deficiency, it instead comes to serve as a defining characteristic of the written word. With no necessity for chain of transmission from author to student, independent interpretation and commentary become central to text. Where the priesthoods of orality focused on memory, the priesthoods of the manuscript monopolized meaning.</p>

<p>As the Vedic guru-shishya traditions exemplify a structure defined by orality, Catholic Christianity serves as one shaped by the manuscript. Catholicism had since its institutionalization with the conversion of Constantine, been intensely hierarchical and strictly focused on the precision of doctrine. Many of its major controversies centered on theological disagreements by the clergy on unsettled questions of interpretation. In contrast to explicitly outsider folk movements such as the earlier gnostics or later medieval heresies, those pushing positions later declared anathema under labels such as Arianism, Nestorianism, or Monophysitism were insiders made into outsiders by conciliar fiat. The Great Schism, despite originating as a political dispute, became a dogmatic one as the two churches diverged, with East moving toward an experiential focus with theoria and hesychasm, while West embraced pagan philosophy and the austere studiousness defined of an emerging scholasticism.</p>

<p>Catholicism, in other words, evolved into a system organized around command structure and authoritative interpretation of texts exclusively done by the priestly class. As dogma proceeded down the hierarchy and completely excluded the input of the laity, much of the role of the clergy was to dictate to congregants passages of text and their proper meanings. The primary duty of lay members in Catholicism was to receive, in faith, the sacraments. Their access to and understanding of scripture was mediated by the figure of the priest, who offered narration during Mass and guidance during Penance. Lay Bible-reading was not only unnecessary for salvation but actively discouraged all the way until Vatican II, and to this day the practice is comparatively rare next to the Protestant traditions.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>



<h3 id="which-shell-to-use">Which Shell to Use</h3>

<p>Bash is the only shell scripting language permitted for
executables.</p>

<p>Executables must start with <code>#!/bin/bash</code> and a minimum
number of flags. Use <code>set</code> to set shell options so that
calling your script as <code>bash script_name</code>
does not break its functionality.</p>

<p>Restricting all executable shell scripts to <em>bash</em> gives us a
consistent shell language that’s installed on all our machines.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is where you’re forced to by whatever
you’re coding for. One example of this is Solaris SVR4 packages
which require plain Bourne shell for any scripts.</p>



<h3 id="when-to-use-shell">When to use Shell</h3>

<p>Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper
scripts.</p>

<p>While shell scripting isn’t a development language, it is used for
writing various utility scripts throughout Google. This style guide
is more a recognition of its use rather than a suggestion that it be
used for widespread deployment.</p>

<p>Some guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re mostly calling other utilities and are doing relatively
little data manipulation, shell is an acceptable choice for the task.</li>
  <li>If performance matters, use something other than shell.</li>
  <li>If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, or
that uses non-straightforward control flow logic, you should
rewrite it in a more structured language <em>now</em>. Bear in
mind that scripts grow. Rewrite your script early to avoid a more
time-consuming rewrite at a later date.</li>
  <li>When assessing the complexity of your code (e.g. to decide whether
to switch languages) consider whether the code is easily
maintainable by people other than its author.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="shell-files-and-interpreter-invocation">Shell Files and Interpreter Invocation</h2>



<h3 id="file-extensions">File Extensions</h3>

<p>Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a
<code>.sh</code> extension. Libraries must have a <code>.sh</code>
extension and should not be executable.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when
executing it and shell doesn’t require an extension so we prefer not
to use one for executables.</p>

<p>However, for libraries it’s important to know what language it is and
sometimes there’s a need to have similar libraries in different
languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but
different languages to be identically named except for the
language-specific suffix.</p>



<h3 id="suidsgid">SUID/SGID</h3>

<p>SUID and SGID are <em>forbidden</em> on shell scripts.</p>

<p>There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly
impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID. While bash does
make it difficult to run SUID, it’s still possible on some platforms
which is why we’re being explicit about banning it.</p>

<p>Use <code>sudo</code> to provide elevated access if you need it.</p>



<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>



<h3 id="stdout-vs-stderr">STDOUT vs STDERR</h3>

<p>All error messages should go to <code>STDERR</code>.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to separate normal status from actual issues.</p>

<p>A function to print out error messages along with other status
information is recommended.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>err<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"[</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> +<span>'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z'</span><span>)</span><span>]: </span><span>$*</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;2
<span>}</span>

<span>if</span> <span>!</span> do_something<span>;</span> <span>then
  </span>err <span>"Unable to do_something"</span>
  <span>exit </span>1
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>









<p>Start each file with a description of its contents.</p>

<p>Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of
its contents. A
copyright notice
and author information are optional.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented. Any
function in a library must be commented regardless of length or
complexity.</p>

<p>It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your
program or to use a function in your library by reading the comments
(and self-help, if provided) without reading the code.</p>

<p>All function comments should describe the intended API behaviour using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Description of the function.</li>
  <li>Globals: List of global variables used and modified.</li>
  <li>Arguments: Arguments taken.</li>
  <li>Outputs: Output to STDOUT or STDERR.</li>
  <li>Returns: Returned values other than the default exit status of the
last command run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#######################################</span>
<span># Cleanup files from the backup directory.</span>
<span># Globals:</span>
<span>#   BACKUP_DIR</span>
<span>#   ORACLE_SID</span>
<span># Arguments:</span>
<span>#   None</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
<span>function </span>cleanup<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  …
<span>}</span>

<span>#######################################</span>
<span># Get configuration directory.</span>
<span># Globals:</span>
<span>#   SOMEDIR</span>
<span># Arguments:</span>
<span>#   None</span>
<span># Outputs:</span>
<span>#   Writes location to stdout</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
<span>function </span>get_dir<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>SOMEDIR</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#######################################</span>
<span># Delete a file in a sophisticated manner.</span>
<span># Arguments:</span>
<span>#   File to delete, a path.</span>
<span># Returns:</span>
<span>#   0 if thing was deleted, non-zero on error.</span>
<span>#######################################</span>
<span>function </span>del_thing<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>





<p>Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your
code.</p>

<p>This follows general Google coding comment practice. Don’t comment
everything. If there’s a complex algorithm or you’re doing something
out of the ordinary, put a short comment in.</p>





<p>Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.</p>

<p>This matches the convention in the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#TODO_Comments">C++ Guide</a>.</p>

<p><code>TODO</code>s should include the string <code>TODO</code> in all
caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person
with the best context about the problem referenced by
the <code>TODO</code>. The main purpose is to have a consistent
<code>TODO</code> that can be searched to find out how to get more
details upon request. A <code>TODO</code> is not a commitment that the
person referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a
<code>TODO</code> , it is
almost always your
name that is given.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># TODO(mrmonkey): Handle the unlikely edge cases (bug ####)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>

<p>While you should follow the style that’s already there for files that
you’re modifying, the following are required for any new code.</p>



<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>

<p>Indent 2 spaces. No tabs.</p>

<p>Use blank lines between blocks to improve readability. Indentation is
two spaces. Whatever you do, don’t use tabs. For existing files, stay
faithful to the existing indentation.</p>



<h3 id="line-length-and-long-strings">Line Length and Long Strings</h3>

<p>Maximum line length is 80 characters.</p>

<p>If you have to write strings that are longer than 80 characters, this
should be done with a here document or an embedded newline if
possible. Literal strings that have to be longer than 80 chars and
can’t sensibly be split are ok, but it’s strongly preferred to find a
way to make it shorter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># DO use 'here document's</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>END</span><span>
I am an exceptionally long
string.
</span><span>END

</span><span># Embedded newlines are ok too</span>
<span>long_string</span><span>=</span><span>"I am an exceptionally
long string."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<h3 id="pipelines">Pipelines</h3>

<p>Pipelines should be split one per line if they don’t all fit on one
line.</p>

<p>If a pipeline all fits on one line, it should be on one line.</p>

<p>If not, it should be split at one pipe segment per line with the pipe
on the newline and a 2 space indent for the next section of the pipe.
This applies to a chain of commands combined using <code>|</code> as well as to
logical compounds using <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># All fits on one line</span>
command1 | command2

<span># Long commands</span>
command1 <span>\</span>
  | command2 <span>\</span>
  | command3 <span>\</span>
  | command4
</code></pre></div></div>



<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>

<p>Put <code>; do</code> and <code>; then</code> on the same line as the
<code>while</code>, <code>for</code> or <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>Loops in shell are a bit different, but we follow the same principles
as with braces when declaring functions. That is: <code>; then</code>
and <code>; do</code> should be on the same line as the if/for/while.
<code>else</code> should be on its own line and closing statements
should be on their own line vertically aligned with the opening
statement.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># If inside a function, consider declaring the loop variable as</span>
<span># a local to avoid it leaking into the global environment:</span>
<span># local dir</span>
<span>for </span><span>dir </span><span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dirs_to_cleanup</span><span>[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>do
  if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>log_date <span>"Cleaning up old files in </span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>/"</span><span>*</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>((</span> <span>$?</span> <span>!=</span> 0 <span>))</span><span>;</span> <span>then
      </span>error_message
    <span>fi
  else
    </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dir</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>ORACLE_SID</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>((</span> <span>$?</span> <span>!=</span> 0 <span>))</span><span>;</span> <span>then
      </span>error_message
    <span>fi
  fi
done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<h3 id="case-statement">Case statement</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Indent alternatives by 2 spaces.</li>
  <li>A one-line alternative needs a space after the close parenthesis of
the pattern and before the <code>;;</code>.</li>
  <li>Long or multi-command alternatives should be split over multiple
lines with the pattern, actions, and <code>;;</code> on separate
lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The matching expressions are indented one level from the <code>case</code> and <code>esac</code>.
Multiline actions are indented another level. In general, there is no need to
quote match expressions. Pattern expressions should not be preceded by an open
parenthesis. Avoid the <code>;&amp;</code> and <code>;;&amp;</code> notations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>expression</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>in
  </span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>variable</span><span>=</span><span>"…"</span>
    some_command <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>variable</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>other_expr</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> …
    <span>;;</span>
  absolute<span>)</span>
    <span>actions</span><span>=</span><span>"relative"</span>
    another_command <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>actions</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>other_expr</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> …
    <span>;;</span>
  <span>*</span><span>)</span>
    error <span>"Unexpected expression '</span><span>${</span><span>expression</span><span>}</span><span>'"</span>
    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simple commands may be put on the same line as the pattern <i>and</i>
<code>;;</code> as long as the expression remains readable. This is
often appropriate for single-letter option processing. When the
actions don’t fit on a single line, put the pattern on a line on its
own, then the actions, then <code>;;</code> also on a line of its own.
When on the same line as the actions, use a space after the close
parenthesis of the pattern and another before …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Cold email outreach is one of the most effective ways of boosting your exposure online. Numerous fortune 500 companies have successfully utilized it in a number of different ways. One of the least talked about aspects of a successful campaign is the preparation needed to do beforehand with the inboxes you plan on sending out mail from. This process is typically referred to as ‘warming up’ an inbox, where you take a brand new email address under your domain and get it prepared to send out a large amount of emails. In this blog post we will be going over all the basics about what this process is, how it works, and why doing so is an important step to perform for any type of cold email campaign. Let's get started.</p><h2 id="what-is-warming-up-an-email">What Is Warming Up An Email?</h2><p>To put it basically, warming up an inbox is simply making a new email account appear to be active and in use by a real person through routinely checking your inbox, sending out emails to other existing addresses, and maintaining email/conversation threads. You are establishing a reputation for this email address that will increase the likelihood that your outreach messages land in the primary inbox of the recipient and not get stopped by spam traps.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-necessary">Why Is This Necessary?</h2><p>The primary reason as to why fresh accounts need to be warmed up is that spammers will constantly be creating new accounts to utilize for their own spam outreach, where they typically get disabled, banned, or blacklisted quickly. This tactic existing within the spam industry has the negative effect on anyone performing an outreach campaign of their own, as one of the red flags for an email getting marked as spam is if it was recently created and does not have any type of reputation associated with it yet.</p><p>Warming up an inbox takes time and patients, but this effort will demonstrate to other mailboxes that this webserver is the real deal and any type of outreach you are performing is not malicious in any way. This will in turn increase your</p><ul><li>Rate of Delivery</li><li>Open Rates</li><li>Click Through Rates</li><li>Positive Engagement rates</li></ul><p>Essentially every aspect of your campaign has a better chance at success when you properly warm up an inbox. This also will drastically decrease the likelihood of an inbox being locked or flagged for violating any TOS under an email service.</p><h2 id="how-long-does-it-take">How Long Does It Take?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/calendar-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/calendar-1.png 600w, https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/calendar-1.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>It's important to maintain a time table for warming up an inbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Warming up an inbox is a long process that cannot be done in a single day or even over the course of a week. Based on past experiences we have had warming up inboxes, the sweet spot appears to be around 2 weeks of work to get an email address ready to be used in a cold email campaign.</p><p>Thankfully, this process is more about maintaining a schedule in which you are performing actions that will demonstrate activity rather than having to dedicate multiple hours every day towards this task. Later on we'll go over the specifics of how you should go about planning out your schedule, but keep in mind that the more time you perform actions to warm up an inbox, the better your reputation will be for the account.</p><h2 id="1-setting-up-the-basics-of-an-address">1: Setting Up The Basics Of An Address</h2><p>After the creation of a new email address, there are a few quick and simple steps that you should follow to establish a baseline identity for the account. The first thing you should do is set up a proper ‘from line’ and signature.</p><p>The from line of an address is what appears right next to the subject line of a piece of mail in a recipients inbox. Typically for personal email addresses, the from line of their account will be their first name + last name, since if you are sending out an email to another individual or business you would want the recipient to know who this email is from without having to guess based on the address itself. For an email account that you are using for cold email outreach, what you set the from line too is entirely dependent on the identity you are going with for this account. For most companies, the identity for an address will either be</p><ul><li>A personalized email with the identity of either a real or fake person at the company</li><li>A role based identity similar to an info@/contact@ address.</li></ul><p>Having a personalized email account when reaching out to contacts is typically the approach I would personally go with, as people are generally much more receptive when they feel like there is a real person on the other end instead of an address where the identity of the sender is not directly obvious. Whatever your purpose is for an email address being used for cold email outreach, you will want to configure your from line accordingly as it adds to the legitimacy of an address as well as will make your outreach attempts appear more legitimate.</p><p>The signature of an email address is what appears as a footer in mail sent to recipients. They will typically appear like this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U5Hrwq8A0fD8X8BBXVABh6OSijqLDu1XuZ2Yi2bwndYYAVABTYbYMI9Yj5QyjS2tufg10Co_QBmnaJRW5mCLKEfelhv-ijuNK9cO0J4Gcfpz1uXsThXss_MVcwbkFuXlnz1FjcJC" alt=""><figcaption>Example of an Email Signature</figcaption></figure><p>I like to think of an email signature in the same way you would a business card, where you essentially place all the relevant information and contact information you can into a small, compact space. This not only adds to the legitimacy of your new email address but also can be used to provide additional information regarding your company and the identity you are setting for this address.</p><p>Performing these two tasks after creating an account will not take much time, but go a long way for building up the legitimacy of your address.</p><h2 id="2-configuring-your-spf-dkim-and-dmarc">2: Configuring Your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/server.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/server.png 600w, https://blog.companywell.co/content/images/2020/07/server.png 665w"><figcaption>Setting up your web server can drastically increase your delivery metrics</figcaption></figure><p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These are acronyms that the average person probably hasn’t heard of but are extremely important for ensuring a successful email outreach campaign.These trio of terms refer to a set of email security protocols that ensure your domain is protected and ensure that emails sent out have a very low likelihood of ending up in the spam folder of the targets inbox. All three of these protocols are inter-related and work together, so it is very important to at least understand what they are, how they work, and how to configure them if you need to. If your company utilizes an IT service, &nbsp;these protocols are most likely already implemented but it is very important to verify that they are yourself. Let's explore each of these protocols.</p><h3 id="spf"><br>SPF</h3><p>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication technique that is designed to confirm the identity of sender addresses and prevent any forged mail from being sent on behalf of your sender domain. The SPF framework is what allows an organization to publish authorized mail servers for the purpose of further authentifying any incoming mail received by other mail servers.</p><p>On a mail server, an SPF Record is simply just a DNS record that is added to your domain. In this record, you simply just specify which IP addresses or hostnames are allowed to send mail under your specific domain.</p><h3 id="dkim">DKIM</h3><p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is another email authentication method that is designed to detect email spoofing, which is the process of creating outgoing mail with a forged sender address. DKIM works in tandem with SPF records in that it allows the receiving inbox to check the validity of a piece of mail that comes from a specific domain. This process is done through the process of attaching a digital signature linked to the domain, where the receiving inbox can match this signature with the public signature of the domain DNS. These signatures are not seen by the user but hide in the metadata of each piece of mail as they are only needed on the backend of the server.</p><p>In relation to SPF, DKIM essentially provides another level of authentication when sending and receiving mail as it just another security handshake to ensure that the mail that other servers are receiving is real and being sent from validated inboxes.</p><h3 id="dmarc">DMARC</h3><p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is the final common email authentication protocol that is designed to further verify mail being sent to an external inbox. DMARC acts as an extension to DKIM and SPF authentication protocols as it allows the administrative owner of a domain to enter a DNS record to specify what protocols are in effect on a domain so the server knows what to look for (As in if you have DKIM enabled on your end but not an SPF record, the DMARC DNS entry will specify this so that the receiving server will know to only check the DKIM signature.)</p><p><strong>3: Sending Out Individualized Emails</strong></p><p>The most important aspect of warming up an inbox is slowly sending out and receiving emails on a daily basis. This is the biggest indicator to email hosting services that an account is indeed being used by an actual person and not being created purely for the purpose of sending out mass mail. This is done in a relatively straightforward manner, where you obtain a number of emails (preferably existing contacts who know beforehand that they will be receiving mail from a fresh account) and simply reach out to them in an organic way. A thing to note is that you do not want to be sending out emails containing random characters, as that can be a clear indication that you are sending out some sort of spam. Even if your emails are different copy and pasted emails, they have to be legible in some way that makes sense if someone were to read them.</p><p>The ideal amount of emails you want to send out per day is around 10-20 per day, spread across a 24 hour period of time where you do not send more than 2 emails out per hour. An ideal workflow will look something like this.</p><ol><li>Send out 10-20 unique, individualized emails out (With subject lines, and content within the body) to existing inboxes per day.</li><li>Open and read all mail that gets received back to you (signing up for newsletters will help this).</li><li>Maintain conversation threads with unique mail received back to you (have receiving inboxes reply back to you will help a lot with this task).</li><li>Perform these steps daily for 2 weeks</li></ol><p>The sending limit is a general rule of thumb I follow as almost every hosting service has a limit …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Broadly speaking, <strong>composition is putting two or more different things together, and getting the same “kind” of thing — a combination of the inputs — as a result.</strong></p>
<p>The concrete meaning might depend on the context, so we’ll look at a few examples that come up in front-end JavaScript development.</p>
<h3><a href="#composition-in-math" id="composition-in-math">Composition in Math</a></h3><p>While math is somewhat unrelated to front-end development, it’s useful to recap the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mathematical definition</a> — if only to show where the term originates.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have two functions. One function is <code>y = 2 * x</code>, which doubles its argument. The other function is <code>y = x + 10</code>, which adds 10 to its argument.</p>
<p>If we put them together so that the output of one function is fed to the other function, we get <code>y = (2 * x) + 10</code>. This is an example of composition — we’ve “composed” this function out of two other functions. <strong>That’s all this term means.</strong></p>
<p>Note how composition of two functions gives us another function. It doesn’t give us something entirely different. As a result, we can keep composing it many times.</p>
<p>Composition is a broad term, but we will only use it when the result of putting things together is the same “kind” of thing — whether it’s a function, a component, etc.</p>
<h3><a href="#function-composition" id="function-composition">Function Composition</a></h3><p>Composition often comes up in the context of functional programming. There, it refers to the same concept as in mathematics, but expressed in code.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have code like this:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> date </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getDate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> text </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> label </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createLabel</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showLabel</span><span>(</span><span>label</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>There is some repetition to this code. A <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1216142369181093889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rhythm</a>, if you will. We take a thing, convert it to something else, take <em>that</em> thing, convert it to something else, and so on.</p>
<p>But can we go further and remove the repetition, leaving only the steps?</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> steps </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>]</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Some might say this code is <a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaner</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s write a function that we’ll call <code>runSteps</code> that applies each step one by one:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>steps</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i </span><span>&lt;</span><span> steps</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> step </span><span>=</span><span> steps</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>step</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>With this function, our original code becomes:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Now let’s say we want to perform all of these steps, but from different places in our program, and at different times. We could write a function that does this for us:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    showLabel</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>Or we could have a function — we’ll call it <code>pipe</code> — that <em>generates</em> our function:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> showDateLabel </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>This code does exactly the same thing, but we didn’t have to explicitly implement <code>showDateLabel</code> (which merely called <code>runSteps</code>). We’ve <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/closure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tucked it away</a> inside <code>pipe</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>steps</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>runSteps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i </span><span>&lt;</span><span> steps</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>let</span><span> step </span><span>=</span><span> steps</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>step</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This reusable function lets us rewrite our code so that <strong>instead of manually calling functions one by one in a sequence, we only specify the steps</strong>. We called it <code>pipe</code> because it “pipes” the output of each previous function to the next one.</p>
<p>Recall our original code:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> date </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getDate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> text </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> label </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createLabel</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showLabel</span><span>(</span><span>label</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>And this is what it looks like with <code>pipe</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> showDateLabel </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  getDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  formatDate</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  createLabel</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  showLabel</span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showDateLabel</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre><p>If you’re not sold on expressing everything using function composition, you might be wondering — what was the point? Why did we go through all of these steps? Isn’t the first example a bit more readable? Are you the only person not “getting” it?</p>
<h4><a href="#functional-eureka" id="functional-eureka">Functional Eureka</a></h4><p>Understanding <code>pipe</code> and function composition for the first time is a lightbulb moment. We don’t have to call our functions manually — instead, we can feed our functions to another function that will give us back a function to call our functions!</p>
<p>How “beautiful”.</p>
<p>There is definitely a profound insight there that we shouldn’t disregard. We have <em>raised the level of abstraction</em> by making the structure of our program itself — a sequence of steps — into something our code can manipulate. For example, we could teach <code>pipe</code> to wrap every step with some logging, or to run every step asynchronously. This is a powerful technique that deserves our understanding.</p>
<p>This programming style can also be a nightmare to work with. We’ve “outsourced” the actual business of function calls to helpers like <code>pipe</code>, and as a result we can no longer clearly see how each piece of data flows in and out of our functions because it all happens inside of <code>pipe</code>. We’ve added a piece of “indirection” — our code is more flexible, but less direct. Add too many layers, and <a href="https://overreacted.io/the-wet-codebase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our heads will overflow</a>.</p>
<p>While this programming style can be used with great success (especially in strongly typed languages that enforce <em>which</em> things can “fit” into other things), it’s a tad overused by enthusiastic programmers who get a dopamine rush from writing clever one-liners and hiding the control flow in “elegant” helpers. I did that, too.</p>
<h4><a href="#function-composition-is-neat-though" id="function-composition-is-neat-though">Function Composition Is Neat, Though</a></h4><p>That being said, the fundamental idea of function composition is important. Essentially, it means that when we have <code>doX(doY(doZ(thing)))</code>, we can <em>first</em> compose <code>doX</code>, <code>doY</code>, and <code>doZ</code>, and <em>then</em> apply the resulting function together.</p>
<p>In the trivial cases like above, using it directly brings more trouble than it’s worth. But it might get more useful if the problem is more challenging. Perhaps, we want each step to be <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/memoization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memoized</a>. Perhaps, each step happens asynchronously and the control flow is more complex. There can be cases where we want something to happen before or after each step, without repeating that fragile logic everywhere. Perhaps, the steps themselves need to be “interpreted” in different ways by our program, so we want to separate their order from how they are being executed.</p>
<p>Function composition can inspire interesting solutions if we keep it mind. This doesn’t mean that we need to take out a <code>pipe</code> every time we want to put two functions together. We don’t need to prove to the computer that we’re smart and learned our lessons about composition. Usually, plain function calls are enough.</p>
<h3><a href="#component-composition" id="component-composition">Component Composition</a></h3><p>Another context in which we might hear the word “composition” is related to declarative UI programming. We’ll take React components as an example.</p>
<p>React components render other components, all the way from <code>&lt;App&gt;</code> to a <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Screen</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Screen</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Form</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Form</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Button</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hey</span><span> there</span><span>.</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This is also called “composition” because we are putting things (components) into other things (components), and they fit with each other (“compose”) pretty well.</p>
<p>One interesting variant of composition is when a component has “slots”:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Layout</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> sidebar</span><span>,</span><span> content </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div className</span><span>=</span><span>"sidebar"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>sidebar</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div className</span><span>=</span><span>"content"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>content</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Then we can “fill in” those slots from different parent components:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>HomePage</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span><span></span></p><p><span>      sidebar</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HomeSidebar</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      content</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HomeContent</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>AboutPage</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span><span></span></p><p><span>      sidebar</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>AboutSidebar</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      content</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>AboutContent</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Note how these “slots” aren’t a special React feature. They are a consequence of our ability to pass down pieces of UI the same way we would pass any other data.</p>
<p>This is also called “composition” because we compose (“fill in”) <code>Layout</code> with different child components. Putting things inside other things.</p>
<h3><a href="#composition-vs-inheritance" id="composition-vs-inheritance">Composition vs Inheritance</a></h3><p>People sometimes say “composition” when contrasting it with inheritance. This has less to do with functions (which we’ve been discussing all along) and more to do with objects and classes — that is, with traditional object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>In particular, if you express your code as classes, it is tempting to reuse behavior from another class by extending it (inheritance). However, this makes it somewhat difficult to adjust the behavior later. For example, you may want to similarly reuse behavior from <em>another</em> class, but you can’t extend more than one base class.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people say that inheritance “locks you into” your first design because the cost of changing the class hierarchy later is too high. When people suggest <em>composition</em> is an alternative to inheritance, they mean that instead of extending a class, you can keep an instance of that class as a field. Then you can “delegate” to that instance when necessary, but you are also free to do something different.</p>
<p>Overall, the industry has largely moved away from modeling UI components as deep inheritance hierarchies, as was common in the 2000s.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean inheritance is always “bad”. But it is a very blunt tool, and it should be approached with moderation. In particular, inheritance hierarchies deeper than a few levels often cause problems that shallow inheritance doesn’t.</p>
<p>Modern front-end codebases rarely use inheritance for their UI because all of the popular UI libraries today feature powerful built-in support for composition. Say, in React, instead of extending a <code>Button</code>, you would <em>render</em> a <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code> in a parent component. Even JavaScript UI libraries that embrace classes typically don’t use inheritance as a way to reuse rendering code. And this is probably for the best.</p>
<h3><a href="#recap" id="recap">Recap</a></h3><p>To sum up, we say that we compose two things when we make a third thing out of them that is similarly shaped. The term has a mathematical meaning, and it is close to its meaning in functional programming. But the further we move away from pure functional programming, the less formal and more colloquial this term becomes.</p>
<p>Function composition is a powerful concept, but it raises the level of abstraction and makes your code less direct. If you write your code in a style that …</p></article></div>

		<p>I’ve never been good at what you might call “life admin”, but I used to keep track of it through having a high level of 1) recall, 2) guilt and anxiety.</p>
<p>I can’t say this system was working <em>well</em>, I was pretty behind on this stuff (such as… still having an Australian bank account five years after I moved away). But the critical things were mainly taken care of and the non-critical… remained in runtime memory.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, having dealt with what I termed the “inner monologue of self hate”, my every failing as a person was no longer running on a loop in every moment of downtime. At this point, I realised I needed a system that didn’t involve me remembering everything and worrying about it.</p>
<p>Enter: Trello.</p>
<h2>Board 1: Life Admin</h2>
<p>I created a board that I “jokingly” called “Life Failures” (since renamed to Life Admin), and set up a bunch of columns. I don’t exist kanban style in my life so the main features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of areas of responsibility, such as “finances”, “house”, “car” etc.</li>
<li>Labels, primarily: “waiting”, “work hours phone call”, “easy”, “blocking”. During lockdown I created a “post-pandemic” label to filter out visually the things I couldn’t expect to make progress on, which was helpful.</li>
<li>A done column that resets each month, i.e. “Done – June”, and “Done – July”. I tend to keep the previous month’s around and then archive when I create a new one. So right now in July, June is still around. When I create August, I will archive June.</li>
<li>Extensive use of checklists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each card is on some level a mini life “project”, and I keep tabs on things using the labels and the checklists. This is the one where I changed my bank account, it entered waiting / blocking states multiple times, was closed off in May, even though it began in March.</p>

<p>This sometimes creates a disconnect between the amount of work I’ve done and the amount I really get to “check off” but I am trying to embrace with this list the idea that life admin is something that is continually chipped away at. The goal is not to empty the board, the goal is to be more on top of things and not create cascading failure in my personal life (again).</p>
<p>Since adopting this system I’ve made progress on so many things that have dragged on for <em>years</em>. Particularly in the “financial” list which has always been my biggest struggle (there is no visual reminder, it’s extremely boring and usually bureaucratic which I find disproportionately stressful). The Australian bank account is closed, I <em>finally</em> managed to transfer my stock from the Conglomerate out of the mandated system and to my regular investment manager (this was so painful and had stopped and started multiple times before we really made a concerted effort earlier this year). I managed to untangle the mess of paying emergency tax for ~18+ months over three tax years. Addressing these things doesn’t really affect my day to day, but it does make it easier to make bigger decisions, because everything is accessible and where it should be.</p>

<p>The board is broad, and there are obvious ways to streamline it or break things out into their own board, but I choose not to. The board is broad because life is broad, and because some months I may move things from one column, and other months from other columns, the point is that everything is tracked, and moving overall.</p>
<p>List of columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Car</li>
<li>Travel</li>
<li>Cate as a Person</li>
<li>Self-Employment</li>
<li>Professional</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Misc</li>
<li>Things to buy</li>
<li>Done – Current Month</li>
<li>Done – Previous Month</li>
</ul>
<h2>Board 2: Day to Day</h2>
<p>At the start of this year, I created a second board, which I call “Day to Day”. The idea of that one is to capture the repeating tasks. This consists of three lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week</li>
<li>Month</li>
<li>Current Month</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given time I have a “week” card which captures the things I try to do every week, and a “month” card which captures the things I try to do every month. When the week is up, I move it under the current month, and then I archive that at the end of the month. Initially I had “day” cards but I found that it was just annoying me, so I got rid of them.</p>
<p>I use template cards, so each time I create a new week or month card, they come with the same checklist. If I was going to add something, I would add it to the template card. For instance, I didn’t feel the need to track going to the gym on the week card because it was 1) more of a daily thing, and 2) a strong habit. After the gym being shut for nearly 4 months, I might add it in as I rebuild that habit.</p>
<p>This is the current state of the board:</p>

<p>The month list is relatively short, and really just captures 1) taking some time for myself (the spa!), 2) a task that I dread (the personal expense report) and 3) the vague thing that I feel is best done through continuous small efforts (the “external thing”, a profile building/maintaining exercise).</p>

<p>The week list is longer, and captures the aspects that I think create a well rounded life – good friendships (regular social interaction, doing something nice for other people), personal well being (writing, cultural experiences, regularly chipping away at the hardest list in life admin) and self care (making an effort with my appearance, maintaining a beautiful home). It’s always interesting what drops off depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>Initially I had the idea that these lists should capture everything, and had the concept of “extras” where I would note down things not covered by the list. But over time I’ve concluded that it works best for me when the concepts are general, and it creates regular opportunities to consider what, of the things I consider important, am I making time for? And what am I not?</p>
<h2>&nbsp;✅</h2>
<p>Both boards combine to address the nagging sense that I’m behind or not doing enough, and allow me to capture what goes into keeping my life moving along and the things make me happy. The things I “should” do no longer run in a loop in my head; they are captured in Trello, and it’s a vastly better way to live.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hopefully by now you have all upgraded to Element, with Android users leaving behind the old legacy Riot Android app. If you haven’t already been previewing it via RiotX (which has been in beta for a year now), it should hopefully feel like a game changer: as we said in our <a href="https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">Welcome to Element</a> post, we’ve got more than just a rebrand going on here!</p><p>But let’s rewind a bit.</p><p>On the 12th of July 2019 (yep, just over a year ago), we <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-the-riotx-beta-for-android-b17952e8f771">released the very first version of what was a complete rewrite of the Riot Android app</a>. This was the beginning of a new era for us; where our UX is intuitive and polished, our apps are fast, and code is modern.</p><p>The step change was needed because, since it was launched in 2015, Riot Android (or Vector as it was called originally) had accumulated quite a lot of technical debt. After 8,113 commits and 1,270,939 changed lines of code, it was hard to maintain, and its limitations were starting to show in the user experience.</p><p>So off went the Android team, led by our UX team, setting up for a year-long marathon, and here goes the result!<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/a_BM-2Sm3GW9LUXoSZOcGIunaf2RvZZ-4PzP5_EnKfSprrJfmsZ3mUV2s3sUewNABgQ3PLwN2F5QTxB17X5CuQib4Zt8J3XrYnK7EAOuQYtbgPc0_6YAxoKE0IOvMN4D07WcHaVE" alt=""></figure><p>Element is built in Kotlin, rather than Java, so it has a much smaller and more maintainable codebase. It means we’re using all the latest Android frameworks (all the good stuff from <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack">jetpack/androidx</a>) and the latest approaches resulting in a clean architecture, well defined dataflows and a proper DB storage layer at last.</p><p>However, the biggest focus on Element Android has been on improving the user experience - throwing away all the stuff which evolved organically in Riot/Android, and replacing it with a user interface which was deliberately and methodically designed and implemented from the outset. Some of the biggest user-facing changes we’ve made for Element Android are:</p><h3 id="radically-simplifying-tabs-">Radically simplifying tabs.</h3><p>Riot previously had separate tabs for Home (showing all icons of your recent rooms on one page, complete with… opinionated horizontal scrolling), and then separate tabs for Favourites, People and Rooms, which duplicated the contents of the Home page, but adding in room previews. &nbsp;Finally, we had the Communities tab, letting you browse the users and rooms of the communities you’re in, which is a bit of a niche use case (especially given Communities need more love to fulfil their full potential in Element).</p><p>So we’ve simplified these five tabs into two: one for people (DMs), and one for rooms. &nbsp;There is no longer any duplication. &nbsp;Favourites sit at the top of the respective two lists, and you always get a one-line preview of the most recent activity in the room. &nbsp;Communities have become a side-panel you get at by tapping on your avatar, along with Settings.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/tabs.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tabs.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/tabs.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/tabs.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/tabs.jpg 2200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>This should be incredibly familiar to folks used to WhatsApp, Telegram or other messengers - and in fact is almost more simple. &nbsp;For power users, we’ve kept a secret ‘Notifications’ tab around too, which you can enable in Settings: Labs, which highlights the unread rooms, just to help you avoid missing any messages.</p><h3 id="reactions-edits-mentions-oh-my-">Reactions! Edits! Mentions! oh my!</h3><p>We’ve had the ability in Matrix to react to messages with emoji, edit messages, and @-mention people as a fancy embedded ‘pill’ for a while now - but poor Riot/Android users had to go without, as we implemented these on RiotX instead (given the last thing we wanted was to burn time implementing them on both codebases). &nbsp;But now RiotX is Element, the spell is broken and everyone can finally enjoy cross-platform reactions, edits and mention-pills!<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/reactions-edits.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="way-better-voip-">Way better VoIP!</h3><p>The 1:1 voice and video calling in Element has been rewritten from scratch - complete with support for picture-in-picture for video calls!<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/voip.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/voip.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/voip.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/voip.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/voip.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="improved-notifications-">Improved notifications!</h3><p>At last, you can now properly set notification levels within the app by long pressing on the conversation in question. &nbsp;Notifications as a whole will get a massive overhaul in the near future, but this is a big step in the right direction.</p><h3 id="qr-scanning-and-cross-signing-for-device-verification-">QR scanning and cross-signing for device verification!</h3><p>We turned on <a href="https://blog.riot.im/e2e-encryption-by-default-cross-signing-is-here/">end-to-end encryption by default</a> back in May. This was possible due to massively improved user and device verification; supporting QR code scanning and emoji comparison for verification - as well as letting users verify their own devices at login, ensuring that they are then trusted by everyone else (“cross-signing”). &nbsp;Folks on Riot/Android were deprived of all of this goodness until Element landed. We hope you’re enjoying the simplicity of user verification relative to the bad old days of having to constantly manually verify everyone’s devices one by one…<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/qr.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/qr.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/qr.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/qr.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/qr.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="massively-improved-onboarding-">Massively improved onboarding.</h3><p>Last but not least, the experience of installing the app, registering, and subsequently logging in is massively improved. &nbsp;We’ve put a huge amount of effort into designing and polishing these flows - which are surprisingly fiddly to get right (especially when you’re decentralised and need to support multiple servers, and especially when you’re end-to-end encrypted and have to support things like cross-signing). &nbsp;The end result should speak for itself though: relative to the ugly old registration/login screen on Riot/Android, Element’s signup and login should feel like a whole new app!<br></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/onboarding.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/onboarding.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="still-to-come-">Still to come.</h3><p>Now, the initial goal before turning the switch from Riot to Element was to get to a state where the features available in Riot Android were also available in Element.</p><p>To be honest, and you may have noticed, we didn’t get <em>completely</em> there and a few things are missing - but hopefully the new features and much better experience will make up for it as we push through finalising the last few things. You can check the remaining gaps between the two apps by looking up the “legacy-feature” tagged issues in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/projects/2">this dashboard</a>, but the biggest ones are probably the lack of integrated video conferencing (meaning that you’ll have to install the Jitsi app in order to do video conferences), and you won’t be able to send stickers yet. 1:1 voice and video calls work however. The other gaps are mostly related to settings - for example associate an email to your account, block/un-block devices, or the option to encrypt the messages only to verified devices - but these are coming soon.</p><p>For those who were using RiotX as the preview for this upgrade, heads up the app is not maintained anymore and will be removed from Google Play at the end of August, so if you haven’t heard the memo: <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">please install Element</a>!! </strong></p><p>Element is even <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/">available on Fdroid</a> already (and made it out before the Google Play version!💥). The ‘old’ Riot app will be deprecated in due course, joining Matrix Console on the nostalgic dusty shelf of memories... </p><p>Logically something can’t be simultaneously new and improved, but the new Element app is exactly that: breaking boundaries wherever it goes!</p><p>Please enjoy our brave new Android world 🤖🚀</p></div></div>]]>

We ran a standard dataset through all three tools to see how they stack up against each other.</p><p>If you are considering using computer vision services from Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure in your product (or you have trained an object detection model of your own and are wondering where you stand in comparison to AutoML) this is the post for you.</p><p>In this post, we review <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/">Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Azure Custom Vision</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl">Google Cloud AutoML Vision</a>.

Evaluating tradeoffs among the big three cloud providers depends on your project specifications (how important is inference speed; what accuracy threshold is required; what inference volume do you expect; what is the size of your dataset). Open source model architectures, while expensive to build and maintain, perform on par with big cloud provider options.</p><p>Unfortunately, each platform uses its own proprietary API and data format so it is very cumbersome to get started and compare solutions. Moreover, once you're up and running, you're locked in. (Luckily, <a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow</a> solves this by seamlessly integrating with all three.)</p><h2 id="overview-of-the-automl-process">Overview of the AutoML Process</h2><p>No matter which platform you choose, you will be entering a similar workflow to create and deploy your computer vision model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-54.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The AutoML Process in a diagram</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong> - In order to train a computer vision model, you first need to acquire images that appear in your domain of interest. The narrower you keep your domain the better your model will perform. Then, your images will need to be labeled providing supervision to train your model to learn the vision concepts in question.</p><p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong> - you will kick of training, a process where the computer formulates an algorithm based on training images to apply to images that it has never seen. Your model will then be evaluated based on how well it performs during predictions. This may be an iterative process as you add data and adjust training length. </p><p><strong>Model Deployment and Inference - </strong>Once you have a suitable model, you will deploy this model to a compute instance and stand up an API endpoint that you can hit to receive predictions based on what your model is seeing in your production images. </p><p>The cloud providers separate data labeling from AutoML, and we will be focusing on reviewing the AutoML service in this post, <strong>assuming you have already collected a labeled dataset.</strong></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-ms-coco">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - MS COCO</h2><p>The original plan was to benchmark these services on the modern standard, the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">Microsoft Common Objects in Context Object Detection</a> (COCO) dataset.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>all three tools failed this challenge</strong> and we were unable to complete training on COCO.</p><p><strong>Rekognition Custom Labels</strong><em> -</em> has a hard-cap on the maximum training time of 72 node-hours per job. If your dataset takes longer than that to converge, the job will time out.

To do this efficiently, the AutoML services will boot up GPU nodes.</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Cost - </strong>Training is started and runs until the model has reached maximum performance. You are unable to control how long training occurs for. Training costs $1/hr/instance and Amazon may provision multiple compute instances to train your model. So your training job may complete in two hours but you will be billed for more if more instances were started. Training can run for a maximum of 72 node hours. If it times out, your training cost is refunded. Be careful, you cannot stop training jobs that have started! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Cost - </strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision trains their model with 8 nodes with Tesla V100 GPUs. Each node hour is $3.15/hr, so ~$25 per wall clock hour. AutoML Vision allows you the ability to start, stop, and resume model training, which can be nice to anticipate the costs before the training job has started. There is no limit to the amount of training time you can provision in Google Cloud AutoML Vision. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/pricing">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Cost - </strong>Azure Custom Vision is less verbose in explaining their training costs - it costs $20/compute hour, but the underlying hardware is undisclosed so it is unclear how this stacks up against the Google and Amazon price/performance. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><h2 id="training-time">Training Time</h2><p>It is hard to benchmark training costs without factoring in training time. Each service may be running a larger or smaller model architecture, and may have varying levels of training time software optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--10-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Waiting for training to complete in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>When starting your training job, you have the ability to choose between large or compact models based on your downstream inference time needs in Azure and Google Cloud.

To make a fair comparison, we sought to use this as our training budget across platforms.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Time - </strong>To stick with with the Rekognition training cost baseline, we would need to use 9 node hours in Google Cloud AutoML Vision, but the minimum time allowed was 20 hours for our PascalVOC 2012 dataset, costing $60. The <strong>recommended</strong> training time was 1,080 node hours - which would have cost a whopping $3402. We chose to train for the minimum time allowed (which still cost &gt;2x Rekognition).</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Time - </strong>Sticking with the Rekognition baseline, we provisioned 1 hour of training time for Azure Custom Vision, costing $20.</p><p>It is worth noting that Google Cloud AutoML Vision and Azure Custom Vision could have likely earned better evaluation performance with a larger training budget. Rekognition does not let you configure this tradeoff at all.</p><h2 id="reported-evaluation-metrics">Reported Evaluation Metrics</h2><p>Object detection systems are rated by <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">the mean average precision metric</a>, a measure of how well the model is detecting objects in test images that it has never seen.</p><p>Google Cloud AutoML Vision is the only platform that reports unbiased evaluation metrics. <strong>Azure Custom Vision and Rekognition are slanting their results in their favor. Here are the gory details. </strong></p><p>As a primer, you may consider reading the blog regarding <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">what is mean average precision in object detection</a> or really getting into it with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqXDdxF_Wuw&amp;t=2s">the mean average precision YouTube</a>. </p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Evaluation Methodology</strong> - Google Cloud reports performance according to the mAP @ 0.5.

                <div>
                    <p>Emulator development has never been simple, but contemporary emulators face a tremendous set of challenges created by the modern era. Having witnessed some of the trials developers have gone through personally, I feel it's necessary to try and give an idea of what I've seen and my perspective on the situation. Some of the following topics are rather touchy, so please try to keep an open mind while reading.</p><h2 id="my-short-history-within-emulation">My Short History Within Emulation</h2><p>I joined the emulation development community mid-2013. Compared to many of the stalwarts of emulation I've met throughout the years, I'm a mere toddler. I'm not a coder and I'm definitely not a genius. I'm just a busy body that tests games and likes to write articles.</p><p>What invited me into emulation was <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a> and the idea of fixing up netplay so that we could get games like Super Smash Bros. Melee working consistently on netplay. With help from my brother, who is an accomplished software engineer now, we worked on netplay issues, asked developers questions, and even released our own modified builds with the goal of eventually getting our changes merged into master. </p><p>Our branch was never fully finished, but others joined the cause and netplay saw great improvements from many developers. Nowadays, the situation is far beyond my wildest dreams, and I can play pretty much any game I want on Dolphin's netplay. There are entire communities built around Dolphin's netplay, including websites like <a href="https://www.smashladder.com/">smashladder</a> which are far beyond the ambitions I held back in the day.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/GALE01-2.png"><figcaption>Back in 2012/2013, working netplay was little more than a pipe-dream.</figcaption></figure><p>During my work on Dolphin netplay, I realized I really enjoyed working on Dolphin and testing these games. There was something cathartic about digging into a game and figuring out what it was doing, how it was doing it, and how Dolphin was emulating it. The feeling of accomplishment when you finally <em>get it</em> and figure out what's going wrong is incredibly powerful.</p><p>Through constant testing, I began to build up my now encyclopedic knowledge of weird game behaviors and how Dolphin handles them that I have today. That knowledge would then come into play as I became one of the writers on the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/series%23series-1">Dolphin Progress Reports</a>. Thanks to the patience and kindness of developers, I know Dolphin well enough to write <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/06/booting-the-final-gc-game/">full length articles on hardware, how games take advantage of that hardware, and what makes things more difficult to emulate.</a></p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/finalgcgameheader.jpg"><figcaption>Learning enough about the GameCube MMU to write about Dynamic BATs was incredibly difficult.</figcaption></figure><p>It may not seem all that surprising nowadays, but back then I never thought it'd be possible to contribute to an emulator as a non-coder. But other skills come into play, and I've contributed to projects like <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a>, <a href="http://mgba.io/">mGBA</a>, <a href="https://citra-emu.org/">Citra</a>, <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/">yuzu</a>, <a href="https://rpcs3.net/">RPCS3</a>, and others. Dolphin itself has definitely influenced the community on the whole as the idea of <em>Progress Report </em>style monthly updates and blog teams have become fairly common.</p><hr><h2 id="the-core-emulator-team-open-source-and-forks">The Core Emulator Team, Open Source and Forks</h2><p>Since the Nintendo 64 and PSX era, emulation development has become about collaboration. The paradigm quickly shifted from plugin based emulators to open source emulators and that's where things have mostly settled for over a decade. After all, open source offers what one would think to be the ultimate advantage of allowing anyone with any skill set to look at the emulator and modify it.</p><p>Regardless of how many contributors a project has, there tends to be a core emulation team that manages the project. Some are more active in development than others, but they all care deeply about the project and will often weigh in on decisions and fight against or for particular changes. While everyone wants to improve the emulator, the core team can deeply affect the direction of the project.</p><p>A strong core team and good decision making is the key to keep a project maintainable and active. Considering that the <em>master branches</em> are the ones that most people contribute to and fork off of, it's especially important to make responsible decisions for the health of the emulator and community on the whole.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/MastervsFork-1.png"><figcaption>Commit history comparison between Dolphin (left) and Ishiiruka (right). Dolphin has a cleaner commit history to show exactly what every change does for people who want to modify Dolphin. Ishiiruka is developed by a few people who are familiar with their changes and thus don't need to spend as much time documenting them.</figcaption></figure><p>There are actually thousands of forks of Dolphin that are based off of this master branch. While the core developers are very careful about what gets merged into master, people can do whatever they want with their own fork, resulting in many specialized versions of Dolphin.</p><p>When open source works, the results can be incredible. Anyone can fix, create, or implement anything while having unparalleled access to the internals of the emulator and the software it can run. You don't even need programming experience to contribute, with many people contributing through services like <a href="https://www.transifex.com/">transifex</a> to help translate and increase accessibility of emulators around the world.</p><hr><h2 id="a-new-generation-of-open-source-emulation">A New Generation of Open Source Emulation</h2><p>I was introduced to Citra long before its initial public release. Since developers worked with me for the blog, I had a bit of an inside line on things they were working on. So imagine my excitement when one of the developers showed me the beginnings of a 3DS emulator as it booted its first game!</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/EarlyCitra.png"><figcaption>This image dates back to 2014, right around when Citra was announced and prompted much excitement.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, Dolphin's Progress Reports had become extremely popular with users and this new emulator, Citra, wanted to do a similar thing. For me? It seemed like a match made in heaven. Unlike Dolphin where I joined it as a fairly mature emulator, I'd be with this one from day one. I was one of the only non-coders within their development channels before the initial announcement.</p><p>Everything at the beginning was exciting with Citra. It felt like this new project with new games to test and new bugs to discover, report, and write about. The first few months went by at a crazy pace, with performance, compatibility, and feature-set expanding at an incredible rate.</p><p>Yet, something was off about the project. I didn't know exactly what, but, I didn't have the same devotion toward it that I did Dolphin. Part of the problem actually had to do with me. I had become specialized to how Dolphin worked through years of testing and working with developers. I didn't put forth enough effort to learn about Citra and developers were too busy still discovering new things about the 3DS to waste time walking someone like me through concepts that would normally be far beyond me.</p><p>In the articles and videos that I did make, I was rather vague because I didn't quite understand how things work. I would constantly compare things to how Dolphin worked, because that was my only frame of reference.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XFcTqoZ3nk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The thumbnail to this video should say everything you need to know.</figcaption></figure><p>If things had proceeded normally and Citra stabilized like Dolphin did, I probably would have adjusted and eventually figured things out. Unfortunately, I didn't last quite that long with the project.</p><h3 id="a-userbase-at-war-with-developers">A Userbase At War with Developers</h3><p>One core thing to remember is that developers care about their projects. While some of the minute details may vary, in the end most of the people working in emulation are working to preserve hardware and/or games in their own ways. It doesn't matter if that means working on the ultimate enhancements, pixel perfect accuracy, or improving performance - they all care.</p><p>Some users don't seem to understand that. They seem to think that these emulators are purposefully crashing or too slow just to frustrate them. That their Pentium IV is newer than a GameCube, and thus should be able to emulate a GameCube regardless of what these people who have worked on this emulator for decades say.</p><p>That isn't to say users are bad. Users are necessary as many of these emulators support giant libraries of games. They report bugs that developers would never know about otherwise, and some of those users fix the bugs themselves and join the project as a new developer!</p><p>I know it's wrong, but, I've lost my temper many times when working within the support forums. I understand that many of these users just want to load up their favorite game and have it work. When you deal with thousands of reports, even if only 10% of them are problematic, they start to weight on you.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/Android-1.png"><figcaption>Users like this are fairly rare on Dolphin's forums but became the normal for Citra for a time.</figcaption></figure><p>Working on Citra's social media and forums was an absolute nightmare because it seemed like <em>everyone </em>hated us. The desires of the userbase and developers shifted so far apart that it bred vicious malcontent and distrust. Before you could even answer a question on a thread, another user would have already replied that the developers don't care. It didn't matter if it was on reddit, facebook, chat logs, or anywhere else, it felt like users hated us.</p><p>What caused this massive divide? Because users wanted to play Pokémon <em>now. </em>Okay, that's a slight exaggeration, it wasn't just Pokémon, compatibility with a few popular games was slow in Citra due to some rather difficult features to emulate that they relied on. Pokémon fans only stood out because they were the most vocal of the annoyed fanbases.</p><figure><img src="https://emucross.com/content/images/2019/06/Comments.png"><figcaption>Even when unrelated features were posted, users were pretty adamant about the things they wanted.</figcaption></figure><p>Early on in Citra it started out with just asking for the games to boot, but the longer things went, the more tense things became. Simple questions became more annoyed as they disregarded the projects efforts until this one, single, thing was supported.</p><p>I don't know if they thought that downplaying everything they didn't care about would move developers toward something they wanted, but it had the effect of making it harder to work …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Getting a calmer and more data informed digest can help you  stay in the loop without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>A dashboard can be one such informational digest, but there are some challenges to making this happen. Creating a live updating dashboard usually involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data acquisition: <em>writing code</em> (usually in Python or R) to query a COVID data API on some regular interval.</li>
<li>Data cleaning: <em>writing code</em> to prep and transform the data for visualization.</li>
<li>Data storage: <em>writing code</em> to store the data in a database or data store of some kind.</li>
<li>Data visualization: <em>writing code</em> to specify how the data should be visualized.</li>
<li>Deployment: <em>writing code</em> to deploy your pipeline, database, and dashboard to the cloud.</li>

<p><a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Apache Superset</a> is an open source dashboarding tool that <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#database-dependencies">supports most databases and data engines</a>. Traditionally, Superset users integrate with one of the supported data stores and have to jump through the code-heavy process described earlier. However, <a href="https://github.com/betodealmeida">Beto Dealmeida's</a> excellent work on the <a href="https://github.com/betodealmeida/gsheets-db-api">gsheets-db-api</a> plugin lets us empower Superset to talk to Google Sheets. <em>(Note: under the hood, Superset saves the data in it's local SQLite instance).</em></p>
<p>To complete this tutorial, you'll need 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Google account to create your Google Sheets</li>
<li>an instance of Apache Superset (installation is quick using Docker -- <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-05-11-getting-started-installing-superset/">instructions here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard way to interface with data hosted on another website is through a REST <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>. API's provide a clean, programmatic way to send or receive data with other web services without needing to understand <em>how those services work</em>. The meteoric rise in web services in the last decade has caused some to declare that API's are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/apis-fuel-the-software-thats-eating-the-world/#:~:text=Marc%20Andreessen%20once%20famously%20said,the%20rapid%20creation%20of%20software.&amp;text=All%20of%20this%20is%20made,into%20a%20world%20of%20services.">eating the world</a>.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://covid19api.com/">covid19api.com</a> provides an API that returns the latest COVID data when you send a <a href="https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/"><strong>GET</strong> request</a>. </p>

<p>Out of the box, Google Sheets doesn't know how to request data from an API like this nor does it know how to handle the common data type that's returned (which is <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>). Thankfully, Google has added <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">support for running custom scripts</a> that allow us to extend the functionality of products like Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The engineer <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper">Brad Jasper</a> has written and open-sourced an excellent script called <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON">ImportJSON</a> that we can add to Google Sheets. This script will expose functions like <code>ImportJSON()</code> that we can use as a spreadsheet formula to fetch JSON data from the COVID 19 API and correctly structure the data in spreadsheet form. </p>
<p>Before we geek out about the power of Brad's script, let's add it to Google Sheets. When we add a Google Apps Script, it's linked to a specific spreadsheet in Google Sheets. So first things first, create a new Google Sheet.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Delete the default code that's there, copy and paste the full text from <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON/blob/master/ImportJSON.gs">ImportJSON.gs</a>, and then save the script. Optionally, you can rename the <code>.gs</code> file to <code>ImportJSON.gs</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Create a new script by selecting <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Script file</strong>. Copy and paste the code from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/aborruso/68547b8df77423226bf7ac0b57d9b73e">code snippet</a> into the new script file and save it as <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. The last step is to rename the first sheet (found on the bottom bar) to <strong>Data</strong> and the second sheet to <strong>DoNotDelete</strong> (the <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code> script looks for this sheet name, so this one is important).</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-data-fetching-and-auto-refresh"><a href="#setting-up-data-fetching-and-auto-refresh" aria-label="setting up data fetching and auto refresh permalink"></a>Setting Up Data Fetching and Auto Refresh</h2>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Once you've added both the <code>ImportJSON.gs</code> and <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code> scripts, add the following formula to cell <strong>A1</strong> in the <strong>Data</strong> sheet.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>=ImportJSON("https://api.covid19api.com/summary", , )</code></pre></div>

  </span>
  </a></p></div></div>
<p>When you press Enter or click outside of the cell <strong>A1</strong>, Google Sheets will run the <code>ImportJSON()</code> function from <code>ImportJSON.gs</code> and display the text <strong>Loading..</strong> until it's done. This function:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes a <strong>GET</strong> request to our API of interest: <a href="https://api.covid19api.com/summary">https://api.covid19api.com/summary</a></li>
<li>parses the JSON data returned from the API</li>
<li>transforms the JSON data to tabular, spreadsheet data by making some assumptions on how that transformation should look</li>
<li>populates the spreadsheet with this transformed data</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything worked correctly, you should see the following data populated.</p>

  </a></p>
<p>To make sure the COVID data is up to date, we need to setup Google Sheets to re-run the <code>ImportJSON()</code> code on some time interval. We can accomplish this using a time-based <strong>Trigger</strong> that runs the <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code> script on a schedule we specify (say every 1 hour or every 4 hours). </p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://gist.github.com/aborruso/68547b8df77423226bf7ac0b57d9b73e">code</a> for <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code>, you'll notice that it just sets the cell <strong>A1</strong> in the <strong>DoNotDelete</strong> tab to a random integer. When this value is updated, Google Sheets will also re-run all formulas in all tabs. This means that <code>=ImportJSON("https://api.covid19api.com/summary", , )</code> will run again and fetch the latest COVID data.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>. Navigate to <a href="https://script.google.com/">Google Scripts</a>, select <strong>ImportJSON</strong>, select the 3 dots on the right, and then select <strong>Triggers</strong>. </p>

  </a></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>. Make your Google Sheet public so Superset can access it. </p>
<p>We are all setup now to create dashboards! If Google Sheets fails to run <code>triggerAutoRefresh.gs</code>, it will email you. </p>
<h2 id="connecting-google-sheets-and-apache-superset"><a href="#connecting-google-sheets-and-apache-superset" aria-label="connecting google sheets and apache superset permalink"></a>Connecting Google Sheets and Apache Superset</h2>
<p>The last configuration step is to add this Google Sheet as a table in Apache Superset. Read our<a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-01-connect-superset-google-sheets/">tutorial post</a> on learn how to connect Google Sheets with Apache Superset.</p>
<p><strong>Two important things to note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each tab (sheet) in a Google Sheets document has a different URL (the URL is auto-updated in your browser when you switch tabs). When adding data sources to Superset, make sure you copy the URL corresponding to the sheet you want to work with.</li>
<li>The Google Sheets plugin for Superset sometimes fails to parse the header row properly when spreadsheet cells have formulas. To get around this, you should add <code>?headers=1</code> in the Google Sheets URL after <code>../edit</code>. Here's an example: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXru_ib0h8c_WwRP4DNKeJg8alWtre9VpJx3Mqs1SrE/edit?headers=1#gid=1393498242">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eXru<em>ib0h8c</em>WwRP4DNKeJg8alWtre9VpJx3Mqs1SrE/edit?headers=1#gid=1393498242</a></li>

<p><strong>Step 10</strong>. In Superset, navigate to <strong>Sources &gt; Tables</strong> and select the table you just added that corresponds to the tab in Google Sheet you want Superset to query.</p>

<p>The Kissat SAT solver is a condensed and improved
reimplementation of <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/cadical">CaDiCaL</a>
in C.</p>
<p>It has improved data structures, better scheduling of
inprocessing, optimized algorithms and implementation.</p>
<p>The solver is not incremental yet, but can be used as a
library.</p>
<h3><a name="news" id="news">News</a></h3>
<p>Kissat won first place in the main track of the <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2020">SAT Competition 2020</a>
and first place on unsatisfiable instances.</p>
<h3><a name="winners" id="winners">SAT Competition Winners</a></h3>
<p>In order to show that SAT solving improved considerably in
recent years, particularly also with Kissat in 2020, we collected
<a href="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners.html">winners</a> of the <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/">SAT Competition</a> from 2002 to
2020 and fixed and ported them to be compatabile with modern
compilers.</p>
<p>Then we were running those "all-time winners" on our cluster on
the competition instances from 2011, 2019 and 2020, more precisely
on the 300 instances from the <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/">SAT Competition 2011
application track</a>, the 400 instances from the <a href="http://sat-race-2019.ciirc.cvut.cz/">SAT Race 2019</a> and the 400
instances from <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2020/">SAT
Competition 2020 main track</a>.</p>
<p>Here are plots showing the number of instances solved within a
certain time limit, thus in essence the runtime cumulative
distribution function (higher is better).</p>
<a name="year-2020" href="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners-2020.pdf" id="year-2020"><img src="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners-2020.png" alt="winners-2020"></a> <a name="year-2019" href="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners-2019.pdf" id="year-2019"><img src="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners-2019.png" alt="winners-2019"></a> <a name="year-2011" href="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners-2011.pdf" id="year-2011"><img src="http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/winners-2011.png" alt="winners-2011"></a>
<p>Note, the <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/">SAT
Competition 2011 application track</a> had only 300 instances,
while the other two benchmarks sets from 2019 and 2020 consist of
400 apparently much harder instances each.</p>
<p>Our cluster has two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10GHz
CPUs and 128 GB of main memory on each node, thus is slightly
slower, but comparable to the StarExec cluster used in the
competition. As time limit we used 5000 seconds as it is now common
in the competition. Main memory was limited to 8 GB for 2011 and
2019 to utilize our cluster best. For 2020 we increased the limit
to 32 GB, which allowed all solvers to stay below the memory limit
(the organizers announced a 24 GB memory limit originally but
actually used 128 GB).</p>

No cluster creation, no maintenance, and you only pay for what you use. We will start by providing a context on why we think this is important, a brief introduction to a couple of concepts and then go directly into a use case.</p><p>Scaling Machine Learning models is hard and expensive. It is costly mainly for two reasons: because the infrastructure is expensive, and because your experimentation pipeline is slow causing your ML team to be constantly waiting for the results.</p><p>It is easy to underestimate how is expensive it is to have an ML team waiting for results. Not only because of the time wasted but also because people get frustrated and end up losing motivation.</p><p>One way to optimize your ML experimentation process it is to build and manage your own infrastructure. This is common in big companies, but this is often prohibitively expensive for smaller companies.</p><p>Traditional software development had similar challenges years ago, companies needed to scale, mainly driven by business needs (slow services/API/website don't scale). Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to provide services that allow companies to scale without upfront costs. They mainly approach this issue in two ways: services that are easier to manage and serverless services. The latter were particularly attractive for small companies that didn't have a big DevOps team or much money to pay for their own infrastructure.</p><p>A similar trend is happening in Machine Learning. This time is driven by the scarcity and high cost of ML talent. Like SW, small companies can't invest a huge amount of money to create a custom optimized infrastructure to ML, it requires a team of experts to build it and maintain it.</p><p>Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to add value similarly by providing Serverless solutions to ML. GCP, in particular, has done this for a while. GCP AI Platform offers different services for each stage of an ML project. But they also count on other services that can help solve ML challenges.</p><a id="what_is_dataflow?" href="#what_is_dataflow?"><h2>What is Dataflow?</h2></a><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a> is a fully managed processing service, that uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> as its programming model to define and execute pipelines. Dataflow is one of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/">many runners</a> that Beam supports.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.</p></blockquote><p>Dataflow in particular has some interesting features:</p><ul><li>Fully managed</li><li>Autoscaling</li><li>Easy implementation</li></ul><a id="what_is_apache_beam?" href="#what_is_apache_beam?"><h2>What is Apache Beam?</h2></a><p>As mentioned above, Beam is a programming model used to define and execute a processing pipeline. It provides an interface to create a processing pipeline that can be executed in multiple environments (such as Spark, Hadoop, Dataflow).</p><a id="use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50" href="#use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50"></a><p>As Computer Vision engineers, we often need to extract embeddings using a CNN model. Here we will present how to build a Dataflow pipeline that generates image feature embedding using a pre-trained ResNet50. Our pipeline will consist of 3 simple steps:</p><ol><li>Load images</li><li>Extract features</li><li>Store features</li></ol><p>To implement our pipeline we are going to use the Apache Beam Python SDK, Keras, Pillow, and Click. Because we will use non-python dependencies we have to structure our code as it is described <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#nonpython">here</a>.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is create a pipeline configuration:</p><pre><pre><code>if local:
    # Execute pipeline in your local machine.
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DirectRunner",
    }
else:
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DataflowRunner",
        "temp_location": "...",
        "staging_location.": "...",
        "max_num_workers": max_num_workers,
    }

options = PipelineOptions(
      project=project_id,
      job_name=job_name,
      region=region,
      **runner_options
  )

options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
options.view_as(SetupOptions).setup_file = os.path.join(
    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute(), "..", "setup.py")
</code></pre></pre><p>As you can see the options change depending on whether we are executing the pipeline locally or on Dataflow.</p><p>Then we need to create a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline">Pipeline</a>:</p><pre><pre><code>with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        ...
</code></pre></pre><p><code>p</code> is our pipeline, to add new steps to the pipeline use the operator <code>|</code> as follow:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | Task();
</code></pre></pre><p>If you want to explicitly name the step you can use the operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code>:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | ("task_name" &gt;&gt; Task());
</code></pre></pre><p>And now we need to specify the steps for our pipeline. There are multiple ways to implement it:</p><ul><li>Built-in implementations: BigQuery connector, ReadFile, etc.</li><li>Custom implementation: Map, Filter, ParDo</li></ul><pre><pre><code>(p
 | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
 | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
 | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)
 | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
</code></pre></pre><p>Here you can see we have added the three steps mentioned above. We are loading the paths to the images from a CSV file in Google Cloud, then we load the images, extract their embedding, and store them in Google Cloud Storage.</p><p>In all the steps in our pipeline we expect to receive one input and return one output. To apply these type steps we must use the method <code>beam.Map</code>. Alternatively, If you are dealing with steps that could potentially receive/return zero or more inputs/outputs, you could use <code>beam.ParDo</code>.</p><p>Now that the pipeline is defined, let's take a look at implementations.</p><a id="loading_images" href="#loading_images"><h3>Loading images</h3></a><p>At this step, we need to download the image from GCS, load it as a Pillow Image, resize it, and convert it into a numpy array object. The reason why we download and resize in a single step, is that we want to reduce the data transferred between steps in the pipeline, thus decreasing the cost.</p><pre><pre><code>def load(path):
    """
    Receives an image path and returns a dictionary containing
    the image path and a resized version of the image as a np.array.
    """
    buf = GcsIO().open(path, mime_type="image/jpeg")
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(buf.read()))
    img = img.resize((IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    return {"path": path, "image": np.array(img)}
</code></pre></pre><p>Beam provides a set of <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/">built-in Connector</a> to handle I/O.</p><a id="extracting_features" href="#extracting_features"><h3>Extracting features</h3></a><p>In this step, we need to load the ResNet model and run the predictions. To avoid loading the model multiple times on the same worker, a singleton wrapper was added to the <code>FeatureExtractor</code> class. Once we extract the embedding, we add it to the item dictionary, and as we do not longer need to have the full image loaded in memory, we remove it from dictionary.</p><pre><pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]

    return get_instance

@singleton
class Extractor:
    """
    Extract image embeddings using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = ResNet50(
            input_shape=(IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 3),
            include_top=False,
            weights="imagenet",
            pooling=None,
        )

    def extract(self, image):
        return self.model.predict(np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))[0]

def extract(item):
    """
    Extracts the feature embedding from item["image"].
    """
    extractor = Extractor()
    item["embedding"] = extractor.extract(item["image"])
    # We do not longer need the image, remove it from the dictonary to free memory.
    del item["image"]
    return item
</code></pre></pre><a id="storing_features" href="#storing_features"><h3>Storing features</h3></a><p>Now that we have the embedding we just need to store it in GCS.</p><pre><pre><code>def store(item, output_path):
    """
    Store the image embeddings item["embedding"] in GCS.
    """
    name = item["path"].split("/")[-1].split(".")[0]
    path = os.path.join(output_path, f"{name}.npy")

    fin = io.BytesIO()
    np.save(fin, item["embedding"])

    fout = beam.io.gcp.gcsio.GcsIO().open(path, mode="w")
    fin.seek(0)
    fout.write(fin.read())
</code></pre></pre><p>Dataflow allows you to specify the machine type, number of workers, objective, etc, providing a lot of flexibility to find the right configuration for the task at hand. You can check all the options <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">here</a>.</p><p>Once you run your Dataflow pipeline you will see logs about the status of the execution in your machine. Another alternative is to use Dataflow web UI. You can learn more about it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-monitoring-intf">on its doccumentation</a>.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow-pipeline.webp" alt="Dataflow UI"></p><p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/dataflow-demo">full code here</a>.</p><p>Apache Beam also supports branching your pipeline. Let's say you want to create 2D visualizations of your embedding, you can do this by branching your pipeline in the following way:</p><pre><pre><code>p = (
   p
     | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
     | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
     | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)))

(p | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
(p | "reduce_dim" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(reduce_dim))
</code></pre></pre><p>This allows Beam to execute <code>store</code> and <code>reduce_dim</code> independently, providing more flexibility to optimize the pipeline, and therefore improving its performance.</p><a id="scale" href="#scale"></a><p>Dataflow provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">multiple configurations</a> that allow you to customize the way you want to scale, in a really easy way. By default, it chooses the values that improve performance. During the execution itself, Dataflow changes the configuration to optimize the performance, changing, for instance, the number of workers, the machine type, etc.</p><p>You can let Dataflow find out what is the best configuration each time you run the pipeline. But if you already know what your jobs need, such as the amount of RAM, or whether it is CPU intensive, what is the maximum throughput supported by your external services (i.e.: your DB or API capacity), it is better to specify this information directly. This will help Dataflow converge faster into the right configuration, speeding up the executing and reducing costs.</p><p>Dataflow should be enough to cover most of small/medium size companies requirements to scale.

<p>It must be a Monday -- someone has trademarked "Infocom"!</p>
<p>No, this doesn't happen <em>every</em> Monday. But over the past twenty years, a surprising number of people have tried to register "Infocom" as a game-related trademark.</p>
<p>The original Infocom company trademarked their name in 1979. Activision purchased the company and the trademark in 1986. But, of course, the Infocom brand didn't last long after that. Activision allowed the trademark to lapse in 2002. (They let "Zork" lapse in 2003. Curiously, they renewed the trademark on "Return to Zork", which remains live today.)</p>
<p>This set off a weird slow-motion frenzy in which some Infocom fan or other would notice the dead trademark and try to do something with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oliver Klaeffling filed a registration in 2007. He posted a web page for a game called <em>Triumvirate</em>, apparently a fan-sequel to <em>Trinity</em>. (I <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2010/02/that-new-official-infocom-web-site.html">wrote about this in 2010</a>.) The game never appeared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.omniconsumerproductscorporation.com/">Omni Consumer Products</a> <em>also</em> filed a registration in 2007. This is a silly but real company run by Pete Hottelet. It sells real version of fictional products like Fight Club Soap and Stay Puft Marshmallows. Omni held onto the trademark until 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob Bates, one of the original Infocom folks, filed a registration in 2017. This was shortly after his <a href="https://www.thaumistry.com/">Thaumistry</a> kickstarter. The game shipped that year, but the trademark registration was not completed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, just a few months ago, a company called <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/">SmartMonsters</a> has filed for it. </p>
<p>Interestingly, this registration only covers "online, non-downloadable" videogames. If you look at the <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/">SmartMonsters</a> site, you'll see that it runs a set of old-school MUDs. By old-school, I mean they are strongly oriented around RPG-style stats, skills, and XP. This is what all MUDs were like before the "social" TinyMUD/MUSH/MOO tree branched off.</p>
<p>One of their available games is a port of <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/Dungeon/Players/index.jsp">Dungeon</a>. It claims to be "mashed-up from several of the 1980s C ports". It's running in a MUD framework, but it's not multiplayer. It's also pretty alpha; I couldn't manage to take inventory or attack the troll.</p>
<p>The SmartMonsters people are clearly long-time MUD-and-IF folks. Their <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/Links/interactiveFiction.jsp">IF resources</a> page links to IFDB, the forum, and a bunch of classic games (including mine). Their <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/Welcome/CompanyInfo/index.jsp">bio page</a> describes co-founder Gary Smith as "...the guy who ported Zork from MDL to C on the PDP."</p>
<p>(I'll note that this is an unrecovered port! All the extant C versions of Zork/Dungeon are translated from Bob Supnik's Fortran version. I dropped SmartMonsters a note asking about it. They say Gary's C port is lost, but he might have a VisualBasic port lying around from the old days...)</p>
<p>I'm pleased to have stumbled across <a href="https://smartmonsters.com/">SmartMonsters</a>. But that's not the weird part of this story! There's <em>another</em> company trying to pick up the Infocom trademark right now. I'll post about them <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com/2020/07/trademarking-infocom-again-part-two.html">tomorrow</a>.</p>
<p>("How do you keep a dornbeast in suspense?")</p>

        <p><strong>Postman is a handy tool that can help you do full stack integration testing of your APIs. Learn how to use it without requiring any panic flips</strong>.</p>
<p>For all <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/importance-upstream-unit-testing/">the value of unit tests</a>, sometimes there’s no replacement for testing an entire application <em>in situ</em>. By <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-api-testing/">hitting your API endpoint in a running system</a>, in one fell swoop you can test the functionality of both your code and deployment integration. This philosophy is popular for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">web-facing applications</a>, with tools such as Selenium letting you exercise the functionality of your website, but similar tools are available for applications that can expose themselves via REST-style APIs.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular of these collaboration platforms for API development and testing is <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a>. Part of Postman’s popularity, no doubt, is because it has a free version, but it also has a lot of useful features and can scale to enterprise needs if you’re willing to fork out some dough.</p>
<p><em>But James</em>, I hear you say, <em>I can test my endpoints using wget or curl</em>! Yes, and you can also start a fire using two rocks. But when there’s a blowtorch sitting right there, wouldn’t you rather use it? (Note: The author in no way endorses using a blow torch to kindle a fire, and any claims that he does so regularly are base slander.)</p>
<p>The problem with poking at your API using command-line tools such as wget and curl is that APIs don’t live in isolation. Frequently, you need to pass the results of one REST call to the next. For example, consider endpoints protected by SSO authentication. You authenticate yourself on one endpoint, take the cookie it provides as a result, and then stick it in the header of subsequent requests to an entirely different endpoint. Yes, you can accomplish that using command-line tools and a bunch of intermediate “glue” code to extract the cookie and pass it on, but Postman basically lets you do it for free.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I show you how to use Postman to extract data from one API call and pass it forward to another. (I don’t tackle SSO, though.) For the purposes of demonstration and to appease my <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77541/11-playful-pieces-pinball-slang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flipper-fixated</a> editor, herein I write some tests against the open-source <a href="https://pinballmap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PinballMap.com</a> REST API, which lets you access a crowdsourced map of public pinball machines.</p>
<p>To start, fire up Postman. Once the application is launched, we can prevent long-term headaches by creating an <em>environment</em>. An environment is a way to specify a bunch of attributes; you can easily change those attributes and settings by switching from one environment to another. This is handy when you need to switch among development, testing, and production endpoints with the same test suite. Rather than duplicating all the tests with three different endpoints, you can define a “host” variable with different values for each platform you test.</p>
<p>In this case, we only know the URL for the production endpoint, but let’s use an environment anyway to show how it’s done.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="520" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-3-1-768x499.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><br>
After we add this environment, the variable called “host” is available whenever this environment is selected. If we had other tiers to test against, we could create a “dev” or “test” environment using a different value.</p>
<p>Once the environment is squared away, it’s time to create a <em>collection</em>. Collections are groups of requests that you can string together into a suite of tests, passing values between them.</p>
<p>Collections can have their own variables. So, for example, you could define the common portion of the API URL in a variable and use it in requests. This can be handy if, say, your REST API incorporates a version number (as Pinball.com does). Put in the version number as a variable; when the API is bumped a version, you can test against the new one by changing the version in one place, rather than in every request.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-2-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="973" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-2-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-2-1-247x300.png 247w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-2-1-768x934.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Another nice feature of Postman is that you can define a collection’s authorization mechanism; then, whatever authentication you choose is carried over onto all the requests you make.</p>
<p>With our environment and collection set up, we’re finally ready to write some requests. We start by requesting a list of all the regions where there is pinball table data.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="507" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1-300x190.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-4-1-768x487.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>We include that “host” variable in the URL for the request, which is replaced with the value defined by our selected environment. When we send the request, we get back a boatload of data in JSON format, which Postman nicely pretty-prints for us. (You can get the raw view as well, should you want it.)</p>
<p>But we don’t just want to fetch the data. We want to test it, and we want to extract values to use for subsequent calls. That duty is fulfilled by the “Tests” tab, where you can plop in JavaScript. In this case, I wrote a simple status code sanity test and a piece of code to pull out the region name of the first record and put it in a variable.</p>
<pre>pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

let jsonData = pm.response.json()

postman.collectionVariables.set('regionname', jsonData.regions[0].name)</pre>
<p>The JSON tree can be walked the same way you’d access JSON data in any other JavaScript code.</p>
<p>You have a choice of scopes for your variables. In this case, we save it at the collection level, which means that it’s available to any other request in the collection. You can also save it as an environment variable, globally, or as even a temporary variable only available during the current test run. (The latter has the disadvantage that you can’t use it if you run the requests one by one, but it’s nice to know about.)</p>
<p>Now that we have a region name, we can get a list of all the locations in that region (which includes the tables available in that location). The URL for that request is:</p>
<pre>/api/v1/region/:region/locations.json</pre>
<p>To replace the “:region” segment with the region name we got from the first request, we create a new request with the URL:</p>
<pre>{{host}}/api/v1/region/{{regionname}}/locations.json</pre>
<p>The {{host}} portion is replaced with the variable we defined in our environment. The {{regionname}} comes out of the collection variable set in the previous request.<br>
<img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1.png 800w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1-300x188.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Turner_API_2020-07-22-5-1-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>That’s the start. You can continue to write further tests, exploring the JSON data and validating results. One critical thing to remember is that because we’re querying a live database, values can change over time. Your tests shouldn’t assume that any particular record will be returned as the results of a request. You should also remember that if you play the <em><u>Pirates of the Caribbean</u></em> machine at Antonio’s Pizza &amp; Pasta in Buelton, CA, it has a very weak left flipper.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In November of 2018 a malicious Javascript package was identified and subsequently removed from the NPM ecosystem. A nefarious modification was introduced into this package, <code>flatmap-stream</code>, which was then added as a direct dependency to the popular <code>event-stream</code> package - and downloaded nearly <strong>8 million</strong> times.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

In 2019 another package, <code>bb-builder</code>, was identified as malicious and removed from NPM. In 2020 over 700 Ruby gems were taken offline. So what can we learn from these types of attacks against the open source community? Software supply chain attacks are both common and extremely effective attack vectors against developers and their end users.</p><p>A newly published paper titled <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09535.pdf">The Backstabber's Knife Collection</a></em> recently made waves in the security community. This paper provides a great analysis across a broad spectrum of software supply chain attacks over the last few years. Not only have we seen a dramatic rise in these sorts of attacks (including some rather high profile breaches, such as the Magecart attacks targeting British Airways, among others), but there has also been a very lackluster response across the industry to the threats posed by these problems. This is a startling revelation considering that according to the Synopsys 2020 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis Report, the majority of commercial code bases across a broad spectrum of industries not only contained open source software, but were composed <em>mostly</em> of open source software. This means that across the board we have effectively given tens of thousands of unknown developers indirect write access to our source repositories with no checks, balances or governance and simply hoped for the best.</p><p>So what does a software supply chain attack look like? The incidents examined in the paper looked at several classes of issues: typosquatting, dependency injection, and repository compromise. </p><h3 id="what-is-typosquatting">What is typosquatting?</h3><p>Typosquatting comprised a bulk of the malware found. The whole idea behind this sort of attack is to take an existing package, add a backdoor to it and re-upload the package with a slightly different name (e.g. <code>raect</code> instead of <code>react</code>). Attackers performed a number of tricks in order to get their package downloaded by developers including: stealing the names of legitimate packages in new ecosystems, making blog posts encouraging the use of the imposter package, or simply hoping developers would mistype the package name.</p><p>Typosquatting has been a prevalent attack against users of NPM. In August of 2017 NPM identified a typosquatted package with a name very close to that of the popular <code>cross-env</code> package. NPM worked to remove this package, and in doing so, identified an additional 40 malicious packages that needed to be taken down.</p><h3 id="injecting-software-dependencies-upstream">Injecting software dependencies upstream</h3><p>In these cases, packages were added upstream from a major project and were able to infect a wide variety of packages downstream. This particular attack takes advantage of the fact that developers rarely investigate their dependencies past the few top level ones that they directly rely on.</p><h3 id="turning-packages-malicious-through-repository-compromise">Turning packages malicious through repository compromise</h3><p>Finally, there were a number of cases where package repositories themselves were compromised. This could happen for several reasons - in one case, the maintainer of a major package, used by thousands of downstream projects, quit, passing ownership of the package to a new maintainer. The new maintainer, having gained control of a very influential piece of the ecosystem, added a backdoor to the package. </p><p>Our independent analysis at Phylum has shown that across the board large centers of gravity exist within package ecosystems, where compromise of a single package may influence many thousands of projects downstream.</p><h3 id="how-do-we-mitigate-software-supply-chain-risks">How do we mitigate software supply chain risks? </h3><p>Since this is clearly a huge issue, what is currently being done about it? Shockingly, the answer is <em>nearly nothing</em>. This is especially interesting as many products now advertise into the space of threat detection and prevention within the software supply chain. However, the reality of the situation is that their focus is on simple threat intelligence feeds - data derived from painstaking manual analysis. An approach that is not only purely <em>reactive</em> rather than <em>proactive,</em> but also doomed to fail. The scope and scale of the data involved is simply too massive to manually analyze, let alone keep up with as new packages are published and existing ones changed. For reference, NPM (which is the largest repository of Javascript packages) contains over a million published packages, with nearly a thousand more published daily. It has grown from around 350,000 published packages to over 1.5 million packages in merely three years! Considering that NPM is simply one of dozens of such repositories, it is easy to see that manually analyzing even a fraction of the packages in existence is simply untenable.</p><p>The authors of <em>The Backstabber's Knife Collection</em> noted that across the board, discovered malicious packages were able to stay in distribution for great lengths of time - in many cases greater than a year before discovery. While each ecosystem makes some attempts at curation they do not seem to be terribly effective at preventing future attacks. The efforts are restricted to small silos of data, which fail to address some of the major issues the paper uncovered (such as cross-ecosystem package listing). Additionally, of all the products currently on the market that do any sort of package analysis, the only solutions provided essentially boil down to manual analysis. If Pitchbook's industry analysis puts the global count of all infosec professionals at 6 million, it is flatly impossible to hire enough staff to police an ecosystem of 60 million or greater packages that are constantly evolving, with tens of thousands more being published every day.</p><p>Clearly, this needs to change. Here at Phylum we are working to bring modern analysis and data mining to bear, providing a path to unite these ecosystems and help protect the open source community.</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/bounce2.png"></center>
<p>When my mother in law told me the solitaire game she loved was no longer online, my friend and I thought that it might be a fun project to launch our own site. We had previously built a consumer business that reached 30M students yearly, and thought solitaire could be a fun playground to learn about gaming and even tie in and test concepts like mental stress and cognition. </p>
<p>We launched our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">free solitaire game</a> on Solitaired.com. </p>
<p>As users came in, we saw that our bounce rate averaged around 37%. â€œNot bad,â€� we thought. Most content sites had much higher bounce rates, and our past businesses that were optimized had bounce rates in that range. When we studied other gaming sites though using Similar Web, we saw that they had lower bounce rates. What if we can achieve something similar or better?</p>
<h2 id="1investigatingbrowserissuesmovingfrom37to34">1. Investigating browser issues: moving from 37% to 34%</h2>
<p>From past experience, we know getting our site to work across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari is no easy feat. Each browser has its nuances, and even if our solitaire game works smoothly on one browser, it doesnâ€™t mean it will work smoothly on others. </p>
<p>Having quickly launched our solitaire site, MVP style, we hypothesized this may be a good place to look based on past experience. </p>
<p>Low and behold, we saw that Safari had a terrible 56% bounce rate. </p>
<p>When we loaded the game in the browser, we noticed that upon clicking the cards, they sometimes did not move as expected. It was a major bug!</p>
<p>We also saw that IE Explorer had an even worse bounce rate of 73%. </p>
<p>With IE Explorer being less than 1% of our traffic and being phased out for Edge, we decided not to invest our time there, and instead fix the Safari bug. </p>
<p>The result: bounce rate decreased by 8%, and dropped to an average of 34%!</p>
<h2 id="2optimizingmobileresponsivenessmovingfrom34to30">2. Optimizing mobile responsiveness: moving from 34% to 30%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/mobile.png"></p>
<p>We saw in our data that mobile users represented approximately 20% of our user base, so we knew that was a segment we needed to pay attention to. </p>
<p>When we looked at our mobile bounce rate in Google Analytics, it was well above our new average of 34%, hovering at 51%. That was clearly an issue. </p>
<p>We first saw in our vertical orientation on mobile that the cards were almost illegible. When we increased the size, mobile bounce rate improved meaningfully to 40%. </p>
<p>Still though, the cards were small because they were limited by the length of the phone in vertical orientation. </p>
<p>What if we optimized our horizontal orientation?</p>
<p>First, we made sure that when tilted horizontally, the cards would take up the entire screen, making the card interaction easier. Then, we created a graphic to encourage uses in vertical orientation to try horizontal orientation for a better experience. </p>
<p>The result: overall bounce rate dropped to 30%!</p>
<h2 id="3changingthecardbackmovingfrom30to28">3. Changing the card back: moving from 30% to 28%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/design2.png"></p>
<p>In our support center, a user asked if we could offer a better design for our card back. We reached out to this user, and asked why.</p>
<p>She said that our current design looked pixelated and didnâ€™t contract well with the green felt. Instead, a red card back that looked like a real card could be better, and indicate that our site was a high quality one. It was one of those insights where you kick yourself and say â€œduh.â€� </p>
<p>To be sure, we ran a user survey via hotjar showing a new card design. 71% of respondents said they preferred our current red card back on the site.</p>
<p>After making this change and our bounce rate decreased to an average of 28%</p>
<h2 id="4addingimportantfunctionalityandreducingbouncerateto26">4. Adding important functionality and reducing bounce rate to 26%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Features.png"></p>
<p>In classic solitaire, there are two popular forms of games played. One is where you turn 1 card at a time over from the stockpile, and another where you turn 3 cards over from the stockpile. </p>
<p>We default to turn 1, but only in our all games menu did we link to the turn 3 options. </p>
<p>We hypothesized that many of our users wanted a turn 3 option, and may have been bouncing when they didnâ€™t see that immediately available. We ran a quick user survey via HotJar and which confirmed this, giving us confidence itâ€™s worth adding this to the game. We added a tab that allows you to flip between modes.</p>
<p>Not only did we see turn 3 solitaire play increase materially, but we further reduced our bounce rate to 26%. 
Whatâ€™s interesting is our users did not naturally write in saying they couldnâ€™t find turn 3. Those users who were looking for it likely just naturally bounced. We had to research and hypothesize to unearth this.</p>
<h2 id="5leveragingdatatodropthebouncerateto22">5. Leveraging data to drop the bounce rate to 22%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/getstarted.png"></p>
<p>Once we added Google event tracking to all our buttons, we were able to get insights into what features were most engaged, and it was eye opening. </p>
<p>It turned out that the hint button was a popular feature. In retrospect, it made sense. Itâ€™s easy to get stuck in solitaire, and undoing is the only way to get you back on track. </p>
<p>We found that after the new game and undo feature, this was the next most popular one, with 20% of our audience clicking it. </p>
<p>However, the hint was on the far right of our navigation. Knowing that internet users look at websites in an F-shaped pattern, this meant that some users who might be new to solitaire might not even notice this feature. If they donâ€™t know how to play, the hint feature is critical to getting them started.</p>
<p>We moved the hint button right after the undo button, closer to the left of the screen. We not only did this increase clicks on it by 25%, we reduced our bounce rate to 22%. Users who had to brush up on how to play solitaire suddenly had an easy way to do that.</p>
<h2 id="youcanalwaysimproveuserexperience">You can always improve user experience.</h2>
<p>Focusing on bounce rate is a great place to start when improving your site. Improving your bounce rate is the rising tide that lifts all business KPIs.</p>
<p>Start collecting data and try user tracking tools like HotJar to understand where there are opportunities to improve. Youâ€™ll be surprised by how much you can improve.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Avo, we receive a number of requests to recommend best practices. In this first post in our best practices series I’d like to tell you about the Purpose Meeting, a great platform to find and prioritize the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking to understand the success for every feature release.</p><h2><strong>Meet the Purpose Meeting</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p><strong>purpose meeting</strong></p><p>/ˈpəːpəs ˈmiːtɪŋ/</p><p><em>noun</em></p><p>A platform to align stakeholders on the purpose of a product release, and map out the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking to understand its success.</p><p><strong>30 minute meeting where stakeholders go through these 3 steps:</strong><br></p><figure id="w-node-a468629a17b6-c4a10212"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e2fb0285251e18fb3221f3e/5ea2389d52f0aa1e99d8c457_Tracking%20the%20right%20product%20metrics%20-%20asset.png" alt="avo-tracking-the-right-metrics"></p><figcaption><em>If you're unsure what to track, try the 30 minute Purpose Meeting, that helps align stakeholders on shipping good metrics and highlights the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking. While building good analytics culture, we recommend doing this with all stakeholders for every feature release. </em><strong><em>Read on for tips on each step.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>We developed the Purpose Meeting at QuizUp, to make our data better. Before every feature release, we’d gather the stakeholders for 30 minutes – an engineer from each development platform (iOS, Android, web, backend), a PM, a designer, a data specialist – and we’d go through these steps ☝️</p><p>‍</p><p>The impact of doing this for every feature release went way beyond ensuring we had the highest-impact-lowest-effort tracking in place to understand the success of our releases. It turned out to be a fundamentally helpful process to ensure alignment on <em>why</em> we were shipping what we were shipping.&nbsp;</p><p>Purpose meetings revolutionized engineering buy-in for analytics at QuizUp. Engineers would request purpose meetings before they kicked off feature development because it made their work more efficient and purposeful. With analytics defined before writing any feature code, iOS and Android would always be in sync. It eradicated the need to refactor code to add analytics after-the-fact. <strong>Analytics went from being a “chore” that was done “for the data team” and “not for the end user”, to something that devs were interested in to understand how successful their release was</strong>. The developer conversion from looking up release metrics in Amplitude sky rocketed – from a couple of developers, to the majority of developers being curious.</p><h2><strong>Your data is a product. It has stakeholders.</strong></h2><p>Your data is a product. It should be considered from usability, market, business viability and engineering feasibility, just like other products. The stakeholders for these four pillars are:</p><p><strong>Data consumers:</strong> Typically Product Managers and Data Scientists, who consume data to build insights and make decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Data producers:</strong> Typically Product Developers who add tracking calls to the product code base to produce data for the consumers.</p><p>To get the most out of your data, you should align these stakeholders, and agree on what data is important and attainable. If you don’t, you won’t be able to prioritize your tracking based on impact and effort.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Purpose Meeting: Deciding the highest impact lowest effort tracking</strong></h2><p>‍</p><h3><strong>1. Align on goals</strong></h3><p>The first step is knowing the reason for your release. Define your goals by asking yourselves questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>What are we trying to help our users accomplish?</li><li>What is the problem that we are trying to solve?</li><li>Who are we solving it for?</li><li>What does success look like?</li></ul><p>Iterate and discuss your goal until you have clarity and alignment for all stakeholders.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> aligns us on the problem we want to solve <em>for our users</em> and what value that brings them. A <strong>bad goal</strong> is framed only from our own business perspective.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> supports our other goals. A <strong>bad goal</strong> creates ambiguity around what’s most important.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> encompasses that problem we want to solve. A <strong>bad goal</strong> leads us to a local maxima by focusing only on a part of the problem.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> is specific enough that it helps us make better decisions for the release. A <strong>bad goal</strong> leads us to want to expand our work out of scope by being too broad.</p><p>A <strong>good goal</strong> is one that all stakeholders can align behind. If you get the right group of people together, the room (or... ehh... Zoom…) will develop great ideas together. A <strong>bad goal</strong> decreases clarity, muddies up the release missions and obscures the goal of the release.</p><h3><strong>2. Commit to metrics</strong></h3><p>Next up is to commit to how you will measure the success of your goal. You can do this by asking questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>How will we know if this goal is successful?</li><li>What steps will the user need to go through to achieve the goal?&nbsp;</li><li>Are there likely user journey drop-offs or dead-ends that we’d want to detect?</li></ul><p>It can be very helpful to think through what our success report and narrative will look like, because it clarifies requirements for the type of data we will need, which helps us design the relevant data in step 3:</p><ul role="list"><li>How will we measure the impact of the release? Compare cohorts of users? A/B test the release? Change over time?</li><li>What is a relevant metric to measure the success of our users?</li><li>Is it the conversion through a set of steps? E.g. open the app and choose a song to play.</li><li>Is it the total count of something? E.g. count of users who play a song per day, or just total number songs played per day?</li><li>Is it a rate? E.g. day one retention, or checkout conversion.</li><li>How do we visualize these? Time series? Bar chart with conversion funnel?</li><li>How do we visualize the comparison? Bar per group? Line per group?</li></ul><p>Iterate on your metric until stakeholders agree that it would help determine the positive or negative impact of the release:</p><p>A <strong>good metric</strong> has clear definitions. A <strong>bad metric</strong> is vague. For example “create a playlist and add at least 5 songs to it”, vs “use playlists”. Or for example, what defines “active” users? Is it enough to open the app or do they need to play a song? Are we talking about daily, weekly or monthly “active”?</p><p>A <strong>good metric</strong> has a way to be understood and visualized. A <strong>bad metric</strong> has multiple ways of interpretation.</p><p>A <strong>good metric</strong> will keep us aligned on whether the release was a success or not. A <strong>bad metric</strong> will leave ambiguity over the success. For example “median # songs per playlist” would be <em>bad</em> to measure the success of increasing conversion to adding songs to playlists. Why? Because it’s likely that the number of users who add songs to playlists will go up, which will negatively impact the metric we chose.</p><p>This exercise will surface a set of metrics. It’s a good exercise, and will help clarify your success criteria. However, it’s important to prioritize them. <strong>You should choose the simplest metric that you’re willing to rely on to determine whether your release was a success or a failure. </strong>It will a) align everyone on the most important needle to move, and b) ensure you prioritize and ship the highest-impact lowest-effort tracking when the time comes to cut the analytics scope due to lack of time until release.</p><h3><strong>3. Design data</strong></h3><p>Finally, it’s time to design the data. Here we use the metrics we committed to as guiding light. Our remaining job is to fill the blanks with the analytics events and properties we’ll need. It’s fun. Like a puzzle. You’ll want to ask questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>Which user journey steps do we need to log to visualize this rate?</li><li>What properties will we need to segment or filter our data by?</li></ul><p><strong>Good data</strong> will be useful as-is. <strong>Bad data</strong> will require the data consumer to ask for engineering time and post-processing. For example, if you’re sending data into Amplitude, don’t assume it’s enough to have the “song id”, because an ID means very little to the data consumer in Amplitude. It will require a data expert to export the data to perform SQL gymnastics on it to enrich it with the song name or artist name. Which means you’ve killed your self serve analytics.</p><p><strong>Good data</strong> gives insight into important user interactions, and the context around that action. <strong>Bad data</strong> requires you to wade through random events and properties that were “tracked just because we can” or because you think “one day we might have a question related to that data”.</p><p><strong>Good data</strong> has nomenclature and granularity level that will scale as your tracking needs grow. <strong>Bad data</strong> is short sighted and becomes messy fast. For example, bad taxonomies have both “game” and “match” to refer to a game. Or for example, if you want to specifically monitor whether they were playing their first song, instead of adding a boolean “is first song” property, you might want to have that property by numerical. “num songs played”</p><h2><strong>Implement analytics and ship product with good product analytics</strong></h2><p>Once you've designed relevant analytics, the final step is shipping your product with these analytics in place:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Document the event names in a single source of truth. Typically this is done in spreadsheets or json files hosted on GitHub. This will ensure consistency across code paths and product platforms (iOS, Android, Web, backend)</li><li>Document metric decisions in context with the event names. This context will minimize mis-aligned implementation across platforms (e.g. different timings on Android vs iOS).</li><li>Test the analytics events before releasing. It's very <em>very</em> easy to make human errors in the implementation process, with tracking code typically not being type safe or tested in other ways.</li></ul><p>Finally, you can build the charts for your metrics once the product is out, and monitor the success of your release.</p><p>Product is a team sport. I recommend scheduling a review session with your team once the feature has been out for a few days or a couple of weeks, to sit down, review success, and identify improvement opportunities.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Tracking the right product metrics</strong></h2><p>We’d love to hear from you. What framework do you use that’s similar to the purpose meeting? Do you have any additional tips?</p><p>‍</p><p>We'll be sharing more on this blog about best practices in product analytics and how Avo can help you manage that dream state -- where everyone has access to reliable analytics, can make data-driven decisions to drive growth. We’re in this together, and we can’t wait to show you how.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3e42f2d53b29461b2add"><div><p>Magnetism is a common phenomenon for all, yet poorly understood by most. We become acquainted with magnetism from a very early age, maybe noticing that they’re used to pin photos and documents to the refrigerator by our parents or maybe we experience them as toys. Maybe we were lucky enough to experience magnetic sand at a science museum. If we were born in Japan, Germany, or Russia, we may have had first-hand experience with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#New_York,_United_States,_1968"><span>magnetically levitated trains</span></a>. In any event, we were each almost certainly astounded by our first encounter with magnets; a seemingly magical action-at-a-distance between two otherwise ordinary looking objects. If you can’t remember the feeling, watch&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/qI8AM8UM7kI?t=29"><span>this kid</span></a>.</p><div><p>But action-at-a-distance is not a matter of magic, it is a matter of physics. Our sense of wonder for magnets may turn to an inquiry into the science behind the familiar phenomenon. Perhaps that is what led you to this page. Unfortunately, as of this publication, the overwhelming majority of explanations for magnetic action terminate in one of two dead-ends. First, you will learn that atoms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM"><span>are each tiny magnets</span></a>&nbsp;and so composite materials simply behave depending on the coordination of their subunits. This obviously punts the question of what makes the tiny magnets attract? For that line of inquiry, we are generally met with the second fatal roadblock:&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms interact magnetically due to magnetic fields. Of course, this explanation, however deep one dives into the mathematical descriptions of fields, begs the question: what&nbsp;<em>is</em>a magnetic field?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"><span>The magnetic field</span></a>&nbsp;of physics is a dynamic description — that is, it has both a shape and motion. This is evident from the basic unit of magnetic field strength, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"><span>ampere</span></a>/m. The ampere signifies charge per time and is the basic unit of current. Hence, a magnetic field is dynamic: it what some<em>thing</em>&nbsp;is doing. Therefore, in alternative to traditional visualizations, our explanation of magnetism begins not with an activity like a field but with an actor: the atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Magnetism is presently understood as one side of a double-headed atomic phenomenon called electromagnetism. Electricity being the simpler of the two faces, it is all but imperative that you go back and&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/how-to-visualize-electricity"><span>read our work-up</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OakgcRuBBbg"><span>watch the animation</span></a>&nbsp;for visualizing electricity before proceeding here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time, I’ll provide you with an extremely brief re-cap. We integrate contemporary mathematical descriptions of electricity into an explanation that we believe improves upon traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XWeQuEhU4"><span>hydraulic</span></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rb9guSEeVE"><span>and electron-bead-flow</span></a>&nbsp;models.&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, we illustrate the concept of charge through the rotation of atomic surfaces. These surfaces, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitals.com/orb/index.html"><span>electron shells (e-shell) or orbitals</span></a>, behave per quantum mechanical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function"><span>electron wave functions</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface-to-surface transmission of e-shell rotation between aligned shells of atoms constitutes electricity. Although there are never electron beads moving along in our wire, our visualization of electricity is entirely consistent with modern mathematical representations. Current flow is merely reimagined as propagation of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;e-shell surface rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We utilize the simplest and most abundant atom, hydrogen, for our explanation of both electricity and magnetism, since it has only a single electron forming one e-shell orbital. We fashion a simple, hypothetical single-atom-thick wire from ionized hydrogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ionization indicates that the atoms electron surface is not localized by enmeshed with its neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can extend the electromagnetic principles applied to hydrogen across other more complex elements and molecules by the careful addition of orbital surfaces, recognizing that new e-shells may participate in conduction and bonding alone while others may rotate freely and separately contribute to magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic action is next explained as a natural extension of the aligned rotation of conducting electron surfaces in a current-carrying wire. Through the vertical transmission of rotational momentum between atoms through polar surface contact, a horizontal interaction is also introduced toward their equators. The magnetic field, B, of the atom describes this surface motion, which occurs 90 degrees orthogonal to current, I (see&nbsp;<strong>Fig 1A</strong>).</p><p>The reason that magnetic action extends beyond the current-carrying wire’s apparent surface is that while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Chemistry/armstrong/chem_101a/h_orbitals.pdf"><span>99.999% of the electron exists within 430 pm of the nucleus</span></a>, there is a small chance of finding that surface extended to incredible distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, under Quantum Mechanics,&nbsp;<a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_the_Electronic_Structure_of_Atoms_and_Molecules_(Bader)/3%3A_The_Hydrogen_Atom/3.3%3A_The_Probability_Distribution_of_the_Hydrogen_Atom"><span>the radial distribution function</span></a>&nbsp;for the electron has no limit on reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our model, we represent this unusual quality of the atom as rarefied extensions of the electron shell:&nbsp;&nbsp;incredibly thin filaments, radially organized about the atom (<strong>Fig 1B)</strong>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595356514575_50369"><p>We imagine the physical extensions of the atomic surface are responsible for the action-at-a-distance. Lateral magnetic motion of conductive rotating e-shells thus synergizes between current-aligned wires, pulling them together as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>&nbsp;below (panels&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>). This illustrates the basic principle of magnetic attraction. By inverting one of the wires, we find that currents are now opposed, as are the magnetic actions of each column’s atoms (<strong>Fig 2C</strong>). The clash of opposing effort between e-shells in each column drives the wires apart and illustrates magnetic repulsion.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_18181"><div><p>To construct the most basic magnet imaginable, we coil up our single-file hydrogen wire as shown in below in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Coiling of the wire aligns the lateral motion of all e-shells on the surface of the composite cylinder (<strong>Fig 3B</strong>). The combined flow of the coil’s composite surface appears to track out from one end of the coil and into the other. The composite magnetic field describes this pole-to-pole flow of the coil’s atomic surfaces.</p><p>It is now easy to understand how the magnetic attraction between current-aligned wires multiplies through the coil’s architecture, since lateral efforts align and combine.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we bring the North pole of one coil near the South pole of another, the radial extensions of the e-shell enmesh laterally and pull the coils together magnetically (<strong>Fig 3C</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverting one coil and pitting South vs. South or North vs. North poles has the opposite effect, where the conflicting effort of each coil’s atoms push them apart (<strong>Fig 3D</strong>).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_54398"><div><p>Again, any visualization of intricate physical processes inherently necessitates simplification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have utilized a single-atom-thick wire of ionized hydrogen for our demonstration and readily acknowledge this as a hypothetical object only. If such a wire exists naturally, its likeness is probably only found in the deep reaches of outer space. In our every-day reality, we only encounter synthetic electromagnets comprised of more complex atoms. This means those metals have additional surfaces. In common conducting materials, such as copper, there may be several polar contacts available for electromagnetic interaction.</p><p>Even more complex metals, like those found in a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"><span>bar magnet</span></a>, appear to utilize separate orbitals for bonding and conduction than those involved in magnetism. We would visualize distinct magnetized e-shells as freely rotating, and spatially isolated from the conductive bonding lattice. This is why “permanently” magnetized materials do not exhibit a current. Furthermore, the relevant magnetic e-shell surfaces in bar magnets still retain the essential pattern of the spiraled coil from our depiction. We are working toward an animation of these complex atoms and will present an appropriate visualization in a future post/video.</p><p>One final note is that often the strongest magnet is a combination of a magnetizable metal with a coil. A magnetizable metal has unencumbered e-shells distinct from bonding and these surfaces are readily incited to magnetic cohesion through contact with coil’s extended atomic surfaces. Often, cores of electromagnets utilize iron or nickel for the very reason that these elements are highly&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"><span>susceptible</span></a>&nbsp;to the magnetic behaviors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"><span>moment</span></a>) of proximally excited atoms in the coil.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contributing aligned e-shells to lateral rotatory action, the iron/nickel atoms amplify the strength of the coil’s electromagnetism.</p></div></div></div>]]>

And we had systems to gate the access that logged whenever an employee looked at customer data and what they looked at.</p><p id="82ba">But the question is: who was looking at those logs? I don’t think they were regularly monitored in places where I worked. And those logs certainly weren’t published to the customer.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Access logs are only useful if they’re being monitored. In many cases, they aren’t and customers don’t know who’s been in their account.</figcaption></figure><p id="d154">When people think they can do something and no one will notice, accountability is lost, even if there’s a record somewhere.</p><p id="c110">Twitter’s embarrassing moment where high-profile accounts were taken over is only an extreme and highly obvious sign of abuse. But even before that happened, Twitter employees were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/twitter-s-security-woes-included-broad-access-to-user-accounts?sref=dZ65CIng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spying on the private messages of notable Twitter users</a>.</p><p id="d71f">And Twitter knows it’s a problem.</p><blockquote><p id="7fee">“In September of 2018, shortly before he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, I met privately with Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey. During that conversation, Mr. Dorsey told me the company was working on end-to-end encrypted direct messages. It has been nearly two years since our meeting, and Twitter DMs are still not encrypted, leaving them vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.” — Senator Ron Wyden</p></blockquote><p id="9a32">Twitter is a recipe for disaster for two reasons:</p><ol><li id="dc69">Privileged users can access private data.</li><li id="a062">There’s no way for users to know when that has happened.</li></ol><p id="9f72"><strong>Without transparency, there’s no accountability. Without accountability, there can be no trust.</strong></p><p id="6819">Twitter is a high profile example, but I believe strongly that these problems have equally high stakes in the business world. Businesses trust their data to Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and thousands of other cloud providers. The more sophisticated of these, like those I’ve mentioned, take extra measures to protect against curious or malicious insiders.</p><p id="21d7">For example, Google recently released GCP Access Transparency so companies can know when a GCP administrator has accessed their data (unless something like a FISA court order compels them to secrecy, in which case they hold back those logs). This feature also lets the customer approve access by support engineers before it happens.</p><p id="345f"><strong><em>Unfortunately, Google only offers this feature to its enterprise customers with premium support levels. And even then it isn’t on by default</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>You have to ask support to turn it on</em></strong><em>.</em></p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Enterprise customers who want GCP Access Transparency have to ask for it.</figcaption></figure><p id="e2b0">Sunshine is the best antidote. When customers can see how their data is accessed, they can react to that information. And when cloud vendor employees know that a customer will see them accessing their data, they act more responsibly and more cautiously.</p><p id="c7c9"><strong>It comes down to </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ironcorelabs.com/saas-trust-models-for-security-and-data-privacy-a83731c2a446"><strong>SaaS Trust Models</strong></a><strong>. Buyers need to know and understand these models to make informed decisions.</strong></p><p id="e019">The full-trust model can no longer be the default when potentially sensitive information is at play. End-to-end encryption and zero-trust models are ideal, but there’s a sliding scale of options including the trust-but-verify model that is fast becoming a standard request from enterprises.</p><p id="023d">It’s time to move incrementally, if not in jumps, to stronger trust models. Full trust without verification is a toxic stew.</p><p id="733f">With great power comes great temptation. Twitter has put this on display, but if you look closely, the same dynamic is everywhere around us. But we can fix it.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Several teams that&nbsp;ranked behind the Iroquois Nationals have been invited to compete in Alabama.</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee —&nbsp;a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse and call it the&nbsp;Creator's Game.</p>  <p>The Iroquois Nationals are member in good standing of World Lacrosse. But it's the International World Games Association (IWGA) that determines eligibility for the Alabama tournament.</p>  <p>The IWGA has not responded to requests for comment. The organizing committee for the World Games in Birmingham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/petition-calls-for-boycott-of-world-lacrosse-games-after-iroquois-nationals-excluded/">told APTN</a>&nbsp;that IWGA follows the&nbsp;criteria established by the International Olympics Committee, which states that "the expression country means an independent State recognized by the international community."</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy more than meets that definition, says Iroquois Nationals executive director Leo Nolan, a Mohawk from the Onondaga Nation. Here is part of his conversation with&nbsp;<em>As It Happens </em>guest host Susan Bonner.</p>  <p><strong>Take us through the moment you found out the Nationals were not invited to the World Games. What was your reaction?</strong></p>  <p>We found out through a third party in late September, early October.</p>  <p>We immediately sent a letter to World Lacrosse asking about our lack of inclusion. And the response back was that we didn't meet what they believed were — and this is their belief — that we wouldn't meet that criteria as a nation state to be included in the Olympics.</p>  <p>All of this is a precursor of the Olympics, which, you know, we're right now on provisional status, lacrosse as a sport. And once the provisional status is lifted, then hopefully lacrosse will be reintroduced to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The Iroquois Nationals travel with Haudenosaunee passports — a fact that has led to travel delays in previous competitions. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Candace Maracle)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does the team rank worldwide?</strong></p>  <p>In the men's ... we are third in the world.

I don't have strong evidence of that aspect of it, and I don't think that that's the way we want to go forward with this.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Finally, a side-by-side code comparison between React and Vue! 🎉</h3>
<p>Back in 2017/2018, I'd been using Vue at work quite a lot. I felt comfortable with it and had a
fairly solid understanding of how it worked. I had, however, been curious to know what the grass was
like on the other side of the fence — the grass in this scenario being React.</p>
<p>I’d read the React docs and watched a few tutorial videos and, while they were great and all, what I
really wanted to know was how different React was from Vue. By “different”, I didn’t mean things
such as whether they both had virtual DOMS or how they went about rendering pages. I wanted someone
to take the time to explain the code! I wanted to find an article that took the time to explain this
so that someone new to either Vue or React (or Web Development as a whole) could gain a better
understanding of the differences between the two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anything that tackled this. So I came to the realisation that I would
have to go ahead and build this myself in order to see the similarities and differences. In doing
so, I thought I’d document the whole process so that an article on this will finally exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-vs-vue.png" alt="Who wore it better?"></p>
<p>I decided to try and build a fairly standard To Do App that allows a user to add and delete items
from the list. Both apps were built using the default CLIs (create-react-app for React, and vue-cli
for Vue). CLI stands for Command Line Interface by the way. 🤓</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences-e9a1ae8077fd">article I originally wrote</a>
ended up going viral. At its height, it was receiving ~1000 views per minute, which I still find
insanely humbling for a tech article. I was really happy to see that many people had found
themselves in a similar situation to me and had been waiting for such an article to be written.</p>
<p>When React Hooks were released, I followed up the original article with a

which replaced the use of Class Components with Functional Hooks. <strong>With the release of Vue version
3 and its Composition API, now is the time to one again update this article with a '2020 Edition'.</strong></p>
<h3>Anyway, this intro is already longer than I’d anticipated. So let’s start by having a quick look at how the two apps look:</h3>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/todo-side-by-side.png" alt="React vs Vue. The Immovable Object meets the Irresistible Force!"></p>
<p>The CSS code for both apps are exactly the same, but there are differences in where these are
located. With that in mind, let’s next have a look at the file structure of both apps:</p>
<p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/folder-structure-side-by-side.png"></p>
<p>You’ll see that their structures are similar as well. The key difference so far is that the React
app has two CSS files, whereas the Vue app doesn’t have any. The reason for this is because
create-react-app creates its default React components with a separate file for its styles, whereas
Vue CLI creates single files that contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its default Vue components.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they both achieve the same thing, and there is nothing to say that you can’t go ahead
and structure your files differently in React or Vue. It really comes down to personal preference.
You will hear plenty of discussion from the dev community over how CSS should be structured,
especially with regard to React, as there are a number of CSS-in-JS solutions such as
styled-components, and emotion. CSS-in-JS is literally what it sounds like by the way. While these
are useful, for now, we will just follow the structure laid out in both CLIs.</p>
<p>But before we go any further, let’s take a quick look at what a typical Vue and React component look
like:</p>
<p><strong>A typical React file:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-todoitem.png" title="A typical React file"></p>
<p><strong>A typical Vue file:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/vue-todoitem.png" title="A typical Vue file"></p>
<p>Now that’s out of the way, let’s get into the nitty gritty detail!</p>
<h3>How do we mutate data?</h3>
<p>But first, what do we even mean by “mutate data”? Sounds a bit technical doesn’t it? It basically
just means changing the data that we have stored. So if we wanted to change the value of a person’s
name from John to Mark, we would be ‘mutating the data’. So this is where a key difference between
React and Vue lies. While Vue essentially creates a data object, where data can freely be updated,
React handles this through what is known as a state hook.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the set up for both in the images below, then we will explain what is going on
after:</p>
<p><strong>React state:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/react-state.png" title="React state"></p>
<p><strong>Vue state:</strong>
<img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-2020-edition/vue-state.png" title="Vue state"></p>
<p>So you can see that we have passed the same data into both, but the structure is a bit different.</p>
<p>With React — or at least since 2019 — we would typically handle state through a series of Hooks.
These might look a bit strange at first if you haven’t seen this type of concept before. Basically,
it works as follows:</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to create a list of todos. We would likely need to create a variable called list
and it would likely take an array of either strings or maybe objects (if say we want to give each
todo string an ID and maybe some other things. We would set this up by writing
<code>const [list, setList] = useState([])</code>. Here we are using what React calls a Hook — called
<code>useState</code>. This basically lets us keep local state within our components.</p>
<p>Also, you may have noticed that we passed in an empty array <code>[]</code> inside of <code>useState()</code>. What we put
inside there is what we want list to initially be set to, which in our case, we want to be an empty
array. However, you will see from the image above that we passed in some data inside of the array,
which ends up being the initialised data for list. Wondering what setList does? There will be more
on this later!</p>
<p>In Vue, you would typically place all of your mutable data for a component inside of a <code>setup()</code>
function that returns an object with the data and functions you want to expose (which basically just
means the things you want to be able to make available for use in your app). You will notice that
each piece of state (aka the data we want to be able to mutate) data in our app is wrapped inside of
a <code>ref()</code> function. This <code>ref()</code> function is something that we import from Vue and makes it possible
for our app to update whenever any of those pieces of data are changed/updated. In short, if you
want to make mutable data in Vue, assign a variable to the <code>ref()</code> function and place any default
data inside of it.</p>
<h3>So how would we reference mutable data in our app?</h3>
<p>Well, let’s say that we have some piece of data called name that has been assigned a value of
<code>Sunil</code>.</p>
<p>In React, as we have our smaller pieces of state that we created with <code>useState()</code>, it is likely
that we would have created something along the lines of <code>const [name, setName] = useState('Sunil')</code>.
In our app, we would reference the same piece of data by calling simply calling name. Now the key
difference here is that we cannot simply write <code>name = 'John'</code>, because React has restrictions in
place to prevent this kind of easy, care-free mutation-making. So in React, we would write
<code>setName('John')</code>. This is where the setName bit comes into play. Basically, in
<code>const [name, setName] = useState('Sunil')</code>, it creates two variables, one which becomes
<code>const name = 'Sunil'</code>, while the second <code>const setName</code> is assigned a function that enables name to
be recreated with a new value.</p>
<p>In Vue, this would be sitting inside of the <code>setup()</code> function and would have been called
<code>const name = ref(‘Sunil')</code>. In our app, we would reference this by calling <code>name.value</code>. With Vue,
if we want to use the value created inside of a <code>ref()</code> function, we look for <code>.value</code> on the
variable rather than simply calling the variable. In other words, if we want the value of a variable
that holds state, we look for <code>name.value</code>, <em>not</em> <code>name</code>. If you want to update the value of <code>name</code>,
you would do so by updating <code>name.value</code>. For example, let's say that I want to change my name from
Sunil to John. I'd do this by writing <code>name.value = "John"</code>. I’m not sure how I feel about being
called John, but hey ho, things happen! 😅</p>
<p>Effectively React and Vue are doing the same thing here, which is creating data that can be updated.
Vue essentially combines its own version of name and setName by default whenever a piece of data
wrappeed inside of a <code>ref()</code> function gets updated. React requires that you call setName() with the
value inside in order to update state, Vue makes an assumption that you’d want to do this if you
were ever trying to update values inside the data object. So Why does React even bother with
separating the value from the function, and why is <code>useState()</code> even needed? Essentially, React
wants to be able to re-run certain life cycle hooks whenever state changes. In our example, if
<code>setName()</code> is called, React will know that some state has changed and can, therefore, run those
lifecycle hooks. If you directly mutated state, React would have to do more work to keep track of
changes and what lifecycle hooks to run etc.</p>
<p>Now that we have mutations out of the way, let’s get into the nitty, gritty by looking at how we
would go about adding new items to both of our To Do Apps.</p>
<h3>How do we create new To Do Items?</h3>
<h4>React:</h4>
<pre><code>const createNewToDoItem = () =&gt; {
    const newId = generateId();
    const newToDo = { id: newId, text: toDo };
    setList([...list, newToDo]);
    setToDo("");
};
</code></pre>
<h4>How did React do that?</h4>
<p>In React, our input field has an attribute on it called <strong>value. </strong>This value gets automatically
updated every time its value changes through what is known as an <strong>onChange event listener</strong>. The
JSX (which is basically a variant of HTML), looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input
    type="text"
    placeholder="I need to..."
    value={toDo}
    onChange={handleInput}
    onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So every time the value is changed, it updates state. The handleInput function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>const handleInput = (e) =&gt; {
    setToDo(e.target.value);
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now, whenever a user presses the <strong>+ </strong>button on the page to add a new item, the <strong>createNewToDoItem
</strong>function is triggered. Let’s take a look at that function again to break down what is going on:</p>
<pre><code>const createNewToDoItem = () =&gt; {
    const newId = generateId();
    const newToDo = { id: newId, text: toDo };
    setList([...list, newToDo]);
    setToDo("");
};
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially the <code>newId</code> function is basically creating a new ID that we will give to our new <code>toDo</code>
item. The <code>newToDo</code> variable is an object that takes that has an id key that is …</p></article></div>

<p>$667 billion dollars were set aside in 2020 for businesses across the US. This program was called the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paycheck Protection Program</a> (PPP for short). It was meant to be a stimulus package to hold over businesses who were impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns. Without revenue streams, many businesses had to lay-off workers en masse, providing a potentially catastrophic destabilization of American society. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were close to 18 million unemployed people in June of 2018. The PPP data indicates that over 31 million jobs were retained due to the program.</p>



<p>Without getting into the inaccuracies of the standard unemployment numbers provided by the Bureau, we can still see that laying off potentially 10% of a country’s population wouldn’t be healthy for society. In the past, the US government has provided stimulus and bailouts primarily via public spending increases and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying toxic assets from big corporations</a>. But this stimulus was meant to directly support businesses of all sizes who were directly impacted by the lockdown. Did it server its purpose? You can be the judge of that! I’ve created a data visualization meant to help show where the money went across the nation. This visualization includes the ability to search and filter on columns of the data. In the near future, I’ll be releasing a dashboard that digs into the… more suspicious loans taken out.</p>
</div>




</div>



<p>Here’s the dashboard, it’s interactive and has some additional info when you hover over data. It is configured for desktop and phones, but is better to view on desktop.:</p>



                



<p>This data was recently released regarding PPP loans. It was split into different data sets. For loans greater than $150k, data for the whole nation is provided in one data set. For loans less than $150k, data is split by state or territory into its own data set. I’ll be providing a combined data set of all loans here in a little bit, but for now this visualization is for loans greater than $150k.</p>



<p>Some interesting takeaways from this visualization:</p>



<ul><li>Allegedly nearly 10% of the US population’s jobs were retained due to the program</li><li>There were TONS of misspellings and bad data entry</li><li>The majority of loans were in the $150k-$300k range</li></ul>

<p>As a nonprofit coding organization running physical events, a lot of what CodeDay does (in a normal year) requires sending things in the real-world. Broadly speaking, this includes event supplies to event teams, and swag/awards to community members and volunteers.</p>



<p>In our early days, I was shipping merch from my office, and every quarter I’d get together with a couple volunteers to assemble and ship out all the event supply boxes for the upcoming events. Eventually, this started to take up too much time.</p>



<p>This isn’t unique to organizations in STEM education, I had the same problem when I ran a startup. People love to represent the startups they use, so sending swag is a great way to market! I have fond memories from my last startup of walking around SoMa in the mornings, trying to find mail dropoffs that weren’t too full so I could stuff a some shirts in for our customers.</p>



<p>Today I’ll share our journey to a fully-automated swag distribution infrastructure. I believe this is something any startup could quickly replicate, so I hope this can save you time!</p>



<h2>First Attempt: Less Steps to Get Things Out the Door</h2>



<p>The first thing we tried was cutting out steps to get things out the door. There were two types of work I was doing: packaging, and labeling.</p>



<h3>Packaging</h3>



<p>90% of people who need swag are getting a single SKU: a t-shirt, a set of stickers, a thank-you letter, etc. So I + some volunteers started by just folding all the shirts and then packaging everything into individual envelopes.</p>



<p>Most of the time was spent on folding the shirts. We’ve recently switched to a printer that will just do this for us, <a href="https://www.gorillaprintshop.com/home">Gorilla Screen Printing in Seattle.</a> Super nice folks, and they will happily deliver individually bagged shirts with size stickers on request.</p>



<p>We kept a database of the final shipping weights of each type of packaged product.</p>



<h3>Labeling</h3>



<p>At this time, all our backend infrastructure was in PHP, so we started out by writing a PHP library to build shipping labels for UPS and USPS. Nowadays <a href="https://www.easypost.com/">Easypost </a>can do this for you, but as you’ll see soon, I don’t think this is the best route anymore.</p>



<p>The system worked like this: someone shared they were going to CodeDay on social media and then filled out a form with their address, the system generated a shipping label, and it was automatically printed with the Dymo LabelWriter API. Every morning I’d grab the printed labels, stick them on the corresponding items, and then take it to the mailbox.</p>



<p>(On the supplies side, our event management monolith, Clear, would automatically generate labels for event supplies once a quarter.)</p>



<p>A few months after we started using this library, I came across <a href="https://www.shipstation.com/">ShipStation, </a>which provides an easy API for entering shipments, and can batch-print shipment labels from a web UI. It was technically less automated than before, but it was nice to have a way to verify what was being shipped and manually add shipments, so we switched everything over.</p>



<p>This worked fine for a year or so, but eventually the volume increased a lot, and they closed the post office next to our office, so we started looking for a better solution.</p>



<h2>Second Attempt: Fully Automated Fulfillment</h2>



<p>To fully automate things, we started looking at 3rd-party logistics providers. These are companies that operate warehouses and employ workers to receive your items, stock them on a shelf, and then pick and ship them when you call an API.</p>



<p>We did some research into a few, which I included at the end, but most providers were focused on e-commerce or larger volumes. We ended out selecting <a href="https://www.shipbob.com/">ShipBob </a>because they had the most sensible pricing for this application.</p>



<p>Speaking of pricing, here’s how it works with ShipBob:</p>



<ul><li>You pay a <strong>receiving fee</strong> for each shipment you send to one of their warehouses. This is on the order of $25 and is insignificant if you’re restocking once or twice a year.</li><li>You pay a <strong>storage fee</strong> for each uniquely addressable item. This ranges from $5/mo – $40/mo depending on how much physical space they allocate to it. If you have 1 shirt in 2 colors and 5 sizes each, that’s 1*2*5=10 unique items. So consolidate your merch variations.</li><li>You pay a <strong>pick/pack</strong> fee for each item someone has to pack in a box… in theory. First several are free, and most orders are 1 or 2 items.</li><li>You pay <strong>shipping fees</strong> which are generally going to be less than what you’re paying now, unless you have a negotiated rate.</li></ul>



<p>All in all, our storage cost was about 1.5-2x what we were paying for a storage locker in Seattle, which feels reasonable to me. We were shipping enough that we had negotiated rates with UPS, so the shipping costs didn’t really change, but for most people that may offset some of the increase in storage.</p>



<p>And obviously this is probably saving a lot of money if you value your time highly.</p>



<h2>What About Print-on-Demand?</h2>



<p>If you’re going to ship a lot of swag, the pricing won’t work out, and the quality is also not amazing. (Not ideal for something you’re counting on people to wear for marketing.)</p>



<p>We’ve been trying Scalable Press for some of our really one-off items like a “CodeDay professional gamer” beanie we give out for our community gaming tournaments. The interface is really bad, but it can work for these use-cases.</p>



<h2>Where We Are Now</h2>



<p>CodeDay’s shipping infrastructure is now fully automated! For example, when a volunteer needs a new staff t-shirt, or some stickers for promotion, they just fill out a form, and a week later, it arrives in the mail. If we need to add something manually, we put it in ShipStation and it gets synced to ShipBob.</p>



<p>Every year, we order a year’s worth of supplies from our vendors and ship them to the warehouse. (Gorilla Screen Printing for shirts and hoodies, Zebra Prints for awards, Consolidated Label for holographic award stickers, Sticker Giant for other stickers, and GS-JJ for pins.)</p>



<p>We can go back to thinking about education! Everything is now magic!</p>

<hr>



<h2>Fulfillment Partner Options</h2>



<h3>Amazon FBA</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Best prices on picking and shipping fees.</li><li>Presumably low rate of picking errors (since I’ve never gotten the wrong Amazon product).</li><li>Wide geographic distribution.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated fee structure which is structured for e-commerce.</li><li>The “long-term storage fee.” Amazon wants high inventory turn-over, and fees increase substantially for items which are stored for more than a year.</li></ul>



<h3>Flexe</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible.</li><li>Wide network of partner warehouse.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible. Shipping isn’t our core competency so we want an opinionated solution.</li><li>Focused on higher volume sellers.</li></ul>



<h3>ShipBob (Our Pick)</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Own a decent number of warehouses in key markets.</li><li>Not too flexible, there is a “right way” to do it.</li><li>Documentation and pricing is less tied to e-commerce than other providers.</li><li>Reasonable fee structure (pay for shelf/pallet space, picking, and shipping) which is theoretically predictable.</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Higher picking error rate for visually similar items like shirts, even when items are barcoded.</li><li>Don’t consistently handle sets. A few times they have opened our sticker sets (a stapled bag labeled “THIS IS A SET DO NOT SEPARATE”) and sent people individual stickers.</li><li>Pricing is unpredictable in practice. Several times they have shipped a shirt in a 3′ cube box for $90, or stored a few small items on a pallet.</li></ul>

I work on Jepsen, which is a project to test distributed systems.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:29">0:02:29</a></span></p><p>And do you remember how you first got involved in the area of data management</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:32">0:02:32</a></span></p><p>out of college? I couldn't get into grad school actually happened during the financial crash in 2009. And I was working up a startup in San Francisco and doing distributed database work</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:42">0:02:42</a></span></p><p>there one thing led to another and so can you dig a bit more into what the Jepsen project is and some of the backstory of how you came to create it and your original inspiration or motivation for digging into this particular area?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:56">0:02:56</a></span></p><p>Yeah, so Jepson is a project to helped make distributed systems safer by testing them and seeing what they do under real world failure modes. And back around 2010, its distributed systems were becoming popular industry. But a lot of folks had sort of optimistic expectations. But what was possible, and there were some claims flying around that seemed a little bit irresponsible. There was a good deal of argument over this back and forth on Twitter and blogs, mailing lists. I was active on the React mailing list for quite some time. And eventually, I started Jepson to demonstrate that these problems were actually things that could happen in the real world. They were just theoretical issues.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:03:39">0:03:39</a></span></p><p>Yeah, I know that particularly when you are just testing and building a system. It's easy to see Oh, everything works great. And kind of push off the fact that there are going to be network faults and there are going to be clock skews and clock drifts that causes things to not operate the way that you want them to. And I'm curious what you have seen As far as some of the common misconceptions or misunderstandings of people who are both building and using distributed systems and the types of guarantees that they provide,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:10">0:04:10</a></span></p><p>yeah, that couldn't be started. There were all sorts of interesting expectations. I remember MongoDB, for example, wrote something about how users shouldn't expect to preserve data when a process crashes or is killed with kill dash nine. And as a result, I think, sort of throwing some sort of cocktail party called kill dash nine. Meanwhile, React was busy falling over anytime you tried to list keys in the database. So there was there's a lot of rough and tumble action in those days. Nowadays. I think people take partitions crashes, that sort of thing more seriously. I see a lot of folks at least tried to do some degree of testing for those. And yet, when I do consulting work, often I'll find databases where it looks like nobody tried to verify behavior during faults.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:56">0:04:56</a></span></p><p>And aside from Jepson, what are some of the other matters methods that people typically use for stress testing or evaluating the guarantees of these systems</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:05:06">0:05:06</a></span></p><p>and look at Jepsen, because it's an experimental approach as being one part of a complete breakfast continuum of quality methods. One of those is to start with a proven algorithm, some sort of abstract model of your system and either to have a hand or machine check proof of it, or at least a model checker, maybe with TLA. And if you are lucky, you can do some sort of code extraction with caulk or high level or cipher f HL with Isabel. But that's, that's not I think how most production systems get built. Most systems get built by pointing at a whiteboard and writing a bunch of code. And then your tools for Safety Analysis tend to be more along the lines of unit tests and integration tests. Jepsen takes a blackbox approach, which puts it sort of at the far end of integration testing other systems like Cassandra's D test suite Take a similar approach. You'll see people who do sort of manual testing where they do fault injection via somebody just running commands on the cluster or toggling some sort of hardware power switch, or network switch. That's the approach that's taken by foundation DB foundation. Devi also does a lot of automated simulation testing, where they will run a virtualized network with many simulated nodes in the same process and they can intercept messages and reorder them to get interesting results. So I think there's there's a lot of approaches people take to testing systems Jepson tries to general and who to work across many types of systems, which often means that it's not as deep or as capable as exploring the state space as a say a simulation test that's written specifically for the database that you're working on might be,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:06:46">0:06:46</a></span></p><p>and then as far as some of the real world usage of things like databases and other mission critical distributed systems, what are some of the real world impacts that can occur as a result of these failures that aren't properly vetted or properly guarded against,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:05">0:07:05</a></span></p><p>oh, you can get all kinds of faults, obviously, data could be lost. So you, you write something and then it just disappears later, you can have different nodes that compete on some version of the history. So maybe one person thinks that the list you're adding things to is 123, and other things, it's four or five, six, you can have temporal anomalies where you read some information from the past, instead of the present. You could have transactional violations where two transactions kind of land on top of each other or interleave, in some weird way. And all these systems that I've tested exhibit,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:40">0:07:40</a></span></p><p>typically one or more of these behaviors. The question is sort of how hard you have to push them to get there. And then in terms of the actual testing approach of using Jepsen for being able to find some of these error modes that exist in a particular system. What is your overall approach for business? Finding the test suite and customizing it for a given system. Because all of these different platforms will have different guarantees that they're trying to provide, or different approaches to linearize ability or serializability, or the strictness of the isolation that they provide. And I know that that provides a fairly extensive surface area to try and cover in any test suite. And I'm wondering just what your approaches for determining what are the key points to interact with. And then also any variability in the actual interfaces that are exposed by these systems for being able to interact with them and validate the correctness of the operations that are being performed?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:08:38">0:08:38</a></span></p><p>Yeah, you're quite right. There's there's sort of two huge surface areas to cover. One of them is the breadth of the API, all the different things databases do. Modern SQL databases have so many functions and so many interacting components that it's really difficult to predict, you know, how they're going to interact. And it also is tricky because when you get awkward misers into the mix. You know, depending on something like the size of your data, you might have two very different code paths that can evolve with different safety properties. So I don't have a good answer for that, you know, I write as many tests as I can in the time that I have. But that's usually just a tiny fraction of the overall API. My guiding principle is to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Surely, you’ve read a hundred blogs telling you how to get <em>X</em> of <em>X</em> in a span of <em>X</em> days/ months.&nbsp;</p><p>This is going to be one of those, so kudos to you for reading 101 blogs. I will, however, try to do something a little different.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s that? Actually explain how we did it.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to launch a product and get traction. I’m sure you’ve tried. Some launches are a success and some a failure.</p><p>Experience teaches us that you need to meet certain requirements before you can launch a successful campaign with the potential of going viral.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>These requirements include:</strong></p><p> 1. A kickass website/ landing page</p><p> - We knew ours was the moment someone told us it was SEXY. See below: </p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bbce8ee55bf0f3e7c2_HG6j15Wm662jjWrODYI1Cf9xnvaBAtMk9xK59NSszL7mT7TRlXCZSOOtP7hLBRZkZ4pjIgYgwc-iFDiiYL6qtngxW5Je9i3SFIkp8cn3M6Wwn4L1EZP2tmzE_028YBL2M2rQVoWt.png" alt=""></p></figure><p> 2. Messaging that is confident and bold</p><p> - We definitely hit the spot here. It made heads turn, and caused a lot of commotion within the marketing community. Remember; confidence stands out.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bb82797a57d1efed1f_2X105KPQdYTgTV7PxJXm9IoVTCbGqiG7e-kT1JhCkWFIEuNHM3qEOCigLmqZBIZfYBj36Tpomh9HiRugh6-Tz7bNB2-xLRgqM2ZTde0TmGVpsdR0ic2R0CtpovP8LaNR6AzgBUTf.png" alt=""></p></figure><p> 3. Easy onboarding</p><p> 4. Make sure it’s not overly long, and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p><p> 5. Call to action that shocks</p><p> - See ours below</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bb8f69c96773aec17f_DVc2MBWHqZCb9rhOI04Q2KwoEPJbP7AOO8OeexLR5b1_fh9RwyiQU09AD2joESzHFDFiVYQdFM-xJ3TQ2a7EIVtmEnBb_Dv3XPfXbD1SGU68Yek3VDh0eJAdFVEJ2OvBeTnLBbTK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p> 6. Make sure your product is solving an issue that needs solving</p><p> 7. A massive reason why products don’t succeed is because of market saturation, and the market not having a need for it. Make sure you do the necessary research before launching your product.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>- TLDR; this won’t work if you have a shitty product.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to delay your launch in order to have these done, do it. You can only launch once, so you better do it right. This definitely won’t work if you’re not willing to put in the work.</p><p>~~~</p><p>I’m your woman on the inside. I’ve been to the dark side. I’ve seen things. I survived and thrived.&nbsp; And now I’m here to help you do the same.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bc63a8cd5bfb49ecac_M59MvVINOvOzBGspgDTXHnfrTtCx6l2J7KbCjmUzTMt1TRsJNEQEZ5W4YfLHu9G0OBHgiFNYmmis6l1HSrGKvEuC85oPb9LNS-MBM2-RJNY91L7r7wCOLR1gKY_UIFo77kBAWPZk.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>So let’s skip the introductions. Just call me your master.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Most companies launch their product with a marketing budget. However, we didn’t have that luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>We had a good product, but once Mr. Covid-19 striked, we became irrelevant and extinct.&nbsp;</p><p>We realized that we had to rethink our product, and that involved building a whole new one. A great one. The first-ever AI-powered employee performance platform - a product needed by so many companies.</p><p>So while most businesses have been kicking and screaming due to COVID-19, we turned what was initially a nightmare for us into something fantastic.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a nightmare. We had layoffs, and pay cuts. We even got rid of our office and moved to a remote setting, which actually has been great.&nbsp;</p><p>So, after spending what felt like forever in product development, we finally announced that our waitlist was available on July 13th, 2020.</p><p>We managed to get nearly 3,000 people to join our waitlist.&nbsp;</p><p>3,000 people ready to improve their employees mental health, performance and happiness.</p><p>With no mailing list, no marketing budget, and a brand no one knew about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>My goal was to get as many impressions as possible.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I joined what felt like a trillion Facebook groups, Slack groups, Linkedin groups, and distribution websites.&nbsp;</p><p>I pretended to be a part of the gang. I dived in head first, and got to know the ins and outs of these communities.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bb75d940208fa3fb49_pnxC-gLOKc83R_iHtfU0lgpfcE5jFHBRLjStivNGVKJViApfacTyyK86HbN6xMZsL5Pyg1YqhHjLy3CXdGs-ggCQsL9TekG7YVcfUFSKcnb4zg7fPZEYB-Aaz-fyHFnxypNkBUBy.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Let your curiosity run free. Lurk around, and check out the members. See how they interact with one another, and see if they fit your audience. Are they within your ICP or are they mere cats?</p><p>You’ll immediately notice that that self-promotion isn’t allowed. It’s forbidden, and if group admins could throw you in jail for it - they definitely would. It’s a big no no.&nbsp;</p><p>You need to to indirectly promote yourself. Let’s dissect how I did that:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bb3bd00c46505ab367_xz_53Qqe-vjLKqs9_-d59oVBrZpbYLxSidgy6SGMg1kQMyCOrDRYwNplCqzInK5cphPt-pXhQ-XCQKVWV8g8c_gCoASfOzkPf9WBYfuU0hMR006laaJeRHmPPcgICeYVD77OqnZl.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bb1e5dbc2fb3b8b7ef_J-Q-uGF5lPBg5qx1eqOg5213Yp_KFNTwvWvOGIz3YC-0ewDbxfPVog2aU-XNS_7fkmymstOE-sE1BY5FnbMMK3NxpZyxiaCDdGw6nsT5EsK0qOC3N7AeD-r2s0FC7B9lF4DLf0N-.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>I’m innocently asking groups for feedback. In order for them to share feedback, they must click the link and they must consume what I’m selling.</p><p>Once you dive into these groups, you’ll notice a few people will be doing what I have done.&nbsp;</p><p>However, what drove my posts to have success was the “Fair warning, our tone is a little aggressive”. That caught people's curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p>Bullseye. 🎯</p><p>I must add. The feedback we got was insane. There was a massive amount of haters, and a massive amount of lovers. Take a look:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bbb9515d690a2d13c5_QDolteCsIjIE_O_z9hksCSkJFcY-ZVAjtnwRWxs9mz9OOQS4Rk7fYA5-A7X1sskI4BnGds0pRaZXEQJ3FV-7FcyAV9BhgoniXh2jwg_739T1nuMyhSkpWCC0U6W0rnfcVVyXzClN.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We didn’t let these negative comments crush our spirits. All press is good press, right?</p><p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p><p>Who would we be if we didn’t launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, we launched on Product Hunt.</p><p>It drove a generous number of sessions to the website, and a jolly amount of waitlist subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p>By begging all of our friends to upvote the product, and leveraging Product Hunt Facebook groups, we were able to see some success there.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5ee9f41a545b903d1171982c/5f1833bb2b84380594424ddf_6AWHl7PkYuGXlNKqxHRjr_tQIhTFVWPDEWAD0O9EDG5FwiEYTfQS1OZ8pDoL5nyuamgZcuPGZcJ1ICtIHOsRMs-CR_nccwELu5_es8JcpWLtZinTrD1k3x-By9vJYK9syj0jzVkJ.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Ok what now?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I submitted daily blasts on the following channels:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a></li><li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indiehackers</a></li><li><a href="https://growthhackers.com/posts">Growthhackers</a></li><li><a href="https://www.designernews.co/">Designernews</a></li><li>Relevant Reddit subreddits</li></ul><p><strong>Here’s something else we did.</strong> While it didn’t have much success, it was a stellar idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Everytime someone joined the waitlist, we told them that they would get priority access if they shared LEON on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-980">

<p>Let’s jump straight to the strange behavior: up until&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.configuration.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHP 7.2.16</a>&nbsp;it was possible by default to exfiltrate local files via the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL LOCAL INFILE feature</a> through the connection to a malicious MySQL server. Considering that the previous PHP versions are still <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the majority</a> in use, these exploits will remain useful for quite some time.</p>



<p>Like many other vulnerabilities, after reading about this&nbsp;<em>quite</em>-unknown attack technique (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2018/04/abusing-mysql-local-infile-to-read.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>), I could not wait to find a vulnerable software where to practice such unusual dynamic. The chance finally arrived after a network penetration test where&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/smaury92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@smaury</a>&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.knowledgebase-script.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHPKB</a>, a knowledge-base software written in PHP which he felt might be interesting to review, and that was my trigger.&nbsp;😏</p>



<p>After deploying it and having a look at the source code, I noticed that during the installation it was possible to test the database connection before actually starting to use it. After going back to review my <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burp</a> HTTP history, I discovered that the API endpoint wasn’t protected or removed after the configuration was completed, and hence it remained available for any unauthenticated user forever after. A PHPKB patch was released shortly after my report and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MITRE</a> assigned it <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>.</p>



<p>Moving on to the exploitation technique, despite it being around for quite some time the malicious servers available weren’t neither really&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/allyshka/Rogue-MySql-Server/blob/master/rogue_mysql_server.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debug-friendly</a>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gist.github.com/bmaia/adc503231ffff19a77aaf0c7abd2e895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standalone</a>. That’s why I chose to invest some time to write one which met both those requirements — the result is available on&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ShielderSec/CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. The script can work in two main modes:&nbsp;<code>server-only</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>exploit</code>. The exploit mode just adds the HTTP GET request needed to trigger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>, while the server-only exposes the malicious MySQL instance and waits for connections. For example, we can now exfiltrate an arbitrary file from a vulnerable PHPKB host in just one command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Believe it or not, you can ship live birds and poultry with the <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/reviews/usps/">United States Postal Service</a>. However, there are quite a few guidelines you’ll need to follow when doing so. Lucky for you, we’re here to drop some knowledge so you’ll know <em>exactly what the cluck is going on</em>&nbsp;when it’s time for you to ship birds. Get it? Got it? Good. Time to spread your wings and dive in!</p>
<h3>You Must Use Priority Mail Express to Ship Birds with USPS</h3>
<p>First and foremost, speed is the name of the game when shipping birds. You need to ensure the birds reach their final destination <em>fast</em>—within&nbsp;72 hours, to be exact. That time limit is a regulation that USPS imposes themselves.&nbsp;Therefore, the only option you’ll have for shipping birds out of <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/choosing-right-usps-mail-class/">all the USPS mail classes</a> is <strong>Priority Mail Express</strong>.</p>
<h3>What Kind of Birds Can I Ship with USPS?</h3>
<p>Pretty much all kinds! You can ship disease-free adult birds, and you can ship chicks that are no more than one day (24 hours) old. If your chicks are older than a day, you’ll need to wait at least six weeks to ship them until they become <strong>juvenile birds</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why Can I Only Ship Chicks When They Are One Day Old?</h3>
<p>The answer lies in simple biology. Right before chicks hatch, they absorb the last of the yolk in the egg. This yolk creates energy stores that sustains the chicks for only up to three days. That’s exactly why chicks need to reach their final destination within 72 hours after hatching…and <em>that</em>‘s why you need&nbsp;to ship them within the first twenty-four hours, assuming you <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/the-fastest-way-to-ship-with-each-major-carrier/">ship Priority Mail Express for the fastest delivery possible</a> (1-2 days). For this same reason, shipping chicks that are more than a day old is prohibited because they don’t have enough energy stores to sustain them throughout their journey. Simply put, there’s a good chance the chicks will die if they are in transit for more than 72 hours.</p>
<p>If the day-old chicks in question are pheasants, keep in mind that you <strong>can only ship them between April and August</strong> (USPS’ rules, not ours). Similar to <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/how-to-ship-live-bees/">shipping honeybees</a>, pheasants are subject to freezing during the winter months.</p>
<p>For additional info on shipping day-old chicks, check out <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c5_008.htm">USPS’ regulations for mailable live animals</a>.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Shipping Adult Birds</h3>
<p>You can only ship adult birds under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You ship them Priority Mail Express</li>
<li>Each bird can’t weigh less than 6 ounces and can’t weigh more than 25 pounds</li>
<li>The number of birds per parcel must follow the container manufacturer limits</li>
<li>The total container weight can’t exceed 70 pounds</li>
<li>Food, such as sliced apples, must be in the container for the birds</li>
<li>You include wood shavings on the bottom of the container (at least a 1-2 inch layer)</li>
<li>You use a mailing container that is constructed by a USPS-approved manufacturer listed on <a href="https://postalpro.usps.com/">the PostalPro website</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Make Sure You Use the Right Kind of Box When Shipping Birds</h3>
<p>As we outlined in the above point, you can’t simply drop off live birds at the Post Office in a regular box. You’ll need a box that has holes in it for oxygen inflow, and it will need to be pre-approved for shipment by the Postal Service. A company called <strong>Horizon Micro-Environments</strong>&nbsp;actually manufactures USPS-approved boxes for shipping live birds, and you can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hm-e.net/">pick some up on their website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In addition to your recipient’s address information, make sure you include their phone number on the box in case they need to be contacted for any reason during transit.</p>
<h3>Use Shipping Software to Save Money on Priority Mail Express Postage</h3>
<p>Using Priority Mail Express to ship live birds and poultry gets expensive. You’re paying for speed, after all. The good news is, you can <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/buy-postage-online/">use online shipping software to buy discounted postage</a>, and you’ll save yourself a lot of money! Most shipping software solutions offer <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/usps-discounts-postage-pricing-tiers/">USPS discounts such as Commercial Pricing</a>, even though the Postal Service typically reserves these savings for commercial shippers. All you need to do is purchase a postage label with shipping software, print it off, attach it to your box, and drop your box off at the Post Office. If you don’t want to leave your birds with the clerk behind the counter, you can also <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/schedule-usps-pickup/">schedule a time for a postal worker to pick up your package</a>.</p>
<h4>Make Sure to Weigh Your Container Accurately</h4>
<p>Postage for Priority Mail Express is based on weight, so if you’re buying postage at home, make sure you have an <a href="https://www.shippingschool.com/how-can-i-weigh-packages-at-home/">accurate way to weigh your packages</a>. You don’t want to drop your package off or schedule a pickup only to find out that you need to pay more for the right amount of postage. Remember: when shipping birds, time is of the essence!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="divbodyholder">  <div id="divbody"> <div> <h3> Responsive deep work </h3> <p> July 28, 2020 — Chris Foster </p> <p>Remote work skills are more critical than ever and I’m feeling pretty lucky lately to have been working remotely the past few years. I used to summarize remote work as something that’s “great for some, but not for everyone”. I felt it would always collapse to one of two states:</p> <!-- Content Breaker --> <ol> <li>Intense, multi-day periods of long focus sessions</li> <li>Whole days of anxiously toggling notifications, social media, and email</li> </ol> <p>Neither of these are ideal. If you’re always jumping on every notification that comes up, you’ll finish the day feeling stressed and like you completed nothing. If you’re always in deep focus, you’ll be inacessible to your team and have a growing, daunting mound of notifications and tasks that you’ll be consistently ignoring. We want to be effective <strong>and</strong> responsive.</p> <p>Steve Streeting’s <a href="https://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/09/04/work-2-0/">“the interruptible programmer”</a> post touched on this idea. I wanted to share my approach too. I’ve found that a proper combination of planning, Pomodoros, and checklists has been great for creating deep focus space while ensuring no key communication is missed.</p> <h2 id="step-1-always-know-your-task">Step 1: Always know your task</h2> <p>Even the best practices for creating focus are useless if you’re focusing on the wrong thing. There’s a lot of methods which help with this, but at the core of them all is that <strong>you should always know what your task is</strong>. I personally use Bullet Journaling and timeboxing to do this.</p> <p><a href="https://clockify.me/timeboxing">Timeboxing</a> is the act of carefully planning your time and the tasks you’ll do in that time. I plan out the majority of my week on Sunday evening. It’s a flexible draft of a schedule, and depending on exactly how busy I am it might only be filled up 50% of the way. These are rough plans. Things like: when I’m going to do my workouts, which nights I’m cooking dinner, my work hours, etc.</p> <p>Each night I plan out the next calendar day carefully from 7am – 11pm. This is now a commitment to myself; I try not to change it if I can. There will be some adjustments along the way, and I update the calendar to match where my time went for reflection later.</p> <p>Timeboxing quantifies where my time is going, to make sure the hours I’m living are lined up with my priorities. Then, <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journaling</a> manages the details. At night, I start my next daily log and migrate up to five tasks into it. This gives me my goal for the next day: doing whatever those five tasks are, in the time boxes carved out in the calendar.</p> <p>Some of them are personal tasks, some are work tasks, and some are workouts. As the day progresses I’ll focus on whatever ones are related to the timebox I’m in at that moment.</p> <h2 id="step-2-create-focus-space-to-do-those-tasks">Step 2: Create focus space to do those tasks</h2> <p>With an organized plan, you need to execute. This can be easier said than done. You start your day with a great plan but an urgent email comes in, a slack notification pops up, you get a call from a friend, you help someone on your team with an impromptu meeting, and next thing you know it’s now 4pm and not one single thing is checked off your list.</p> <p>You have to do practice the next rule: <strong>spend most of your time ignoring everything except your current task</strong>. Pomodoros are a great tool to do that.</p> <p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoros</a>, the idea is simple: you spend 25 minutes of focus time working on a single task at a time, followed by a five minute break. After every four Pomdoros you take a longer, fifteen minute break.</p> <p>You can use your phone timer to do this, but apps can be handy for ease of use and tracking how many sessions you’ve done in a day. I use <a href="http://www.fohkuhs.com/">Fohkuhs</a>, but it’s kind of unmaintained and if I was recommending a new one I might use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470?mt=12">Be Focused</a>.</p> <p>When doing a Pomodoro, your computer should be on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchl999b7c1a/mac">Do Not Disturb</a>. Your phone should be on silent. You should not check Facebook, respond to or read notifications, or even use the washroom. If you break any of these rules, restart the Pomodoro from scratch. Get into the habit creating focus space for yourself for twenty-five minutes and it becomes second nature.</p> <p>This is where one of the perks of being remote comes in: you can easily create a space in which it’s really hard to interrupt you. Your home situation might require some tweaking to make this work, depending on what it is. Make sure your roommates, partner, etc. understand this.</p> <p>If absolutely necessary, try to quickly address an interruption by saying you’ll get back to them and note a task to do so into your Bullet Journal. If it’s urgent, you can get to it within 25 minutes by making it the task for the next Pomodoro.</p> <h3 id="step-3-use-checklists-to-manage-distractions">Step 3: Use checklists to manage distractions</h3> <p>Pomodoro was originally designed as a study method, so the five minute breaks were genuine breaks where you take a step away to relax. I’ve often heard people tell me that they struggle with Pomodoros once they start to get into the zone. They don’t <em>want</em> to stop for five minutes.</p> <p>What I’ve found to be the problem is not that the five minutes are a change in focus, it’s that it is a <em>break in flow</em>. It provides no guidance about what we do in that break. Instead, with checklists for your breaks, you make your breaks <em>part</em> of your flow.</p> <p>Unless you’re an <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">academic professor</a> with tons of time for deep work, or a student who can study uninterrupted at length, there are probably things which come up during the work day that you need to respond to. This is especially true for remote startup teams – while you’ve been heads down there’s now email, instant message, code reviews, and other things to attend to.</p> <p>We address these in the break. Breaks are for notifications, slack, email, quick replies, follow ups, and so on. Five minutes isn’t a lot of time and the modern world is filled with 101 different services that need your attention. To deal with that, we have rule three: <strong>have a checklist prioritizing the key flow during your break</strong>. Make notifications a workflow, not a distraction. This checklist will be very specific to each person, but here is what mine looks like:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/responsive-deep-work/pomodoro.png" alt="Pomodoro checklist"></p> <p>For the first few Pomodoros, it’s only a five minute break. Not a ton of time, but enough to sort through most notifications. When doing this, I follow the two-minute rule: anything that will take more than two minutes to deal with ends up as an additional item on the Bullet Journal. I might even decide that I need to spend the next Pomodoro focusing on it – that’s fine to do.</p> <p>The checklist is just a document in notion. I keep it open on my main space at all times. Alongside that I also keep a browser window with email and calendar open in pinned tabs. Slack too. I consider it my “notification space”. When I’m in a Pomodoro, even if it’s just one window I need, I <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac">create a new space</a> and switch over to it so that no distractions are visible.</p> <p>Checklists are my favorite secret weapon. They’re great for offloading cognitive overhead. Use them for everything, even things that seem silly to use a checklist for. I have a morning checklist that I run through as my first Pomodoro of the day as well as an evening checklist I run through before bed. <a href="https://blog.nuclino.com/the-simple-genius-of-checklists-from-b-17-to-the-apollo-missions">Nuclino has a post about why they’re so great</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes — or typically — you won’t get all the way through the checklist. That’s totally fine. I usually get to at least working on some emails. The important part is to go back to focus time when the timer ends. I’ve noticed that notifications ebb and flow. Sometimes there are more and I fall behind on non-urgent things, sometimes there are less and I catch up on things naturally.</p> <p>When the break timer is up, start a new Pomodoro and switch back to focus time. If a new, additional item on the Bullet Journal is really important, it might be what I work on as my next Pomodoro. Typically I go back to what I was just doing though.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>One thing I really like about this system is that it’s very anti-producitivity-porn. The “tools” here consist of easily replaceable applications and a paper notebook. I’ve been doing tasks this way for a few years now and it no longer feels like I’m chasing “the next big productivity system”.</p> <p>In a day with a lot of meetings, I might maybe only get a few Pomodoros in. In a day with decent focus time I can get around 10. A really productive day might be up to 15. That five or more hours of deep work while keeping on top of messages with less than a 30 minute turnaround.</p> <p>I can absolutely imagine that this is not a system for everyone.

I have to bring bank statements. I have to bring letters. [...] It's honestly like a humiliating and unnecessary process. And of course, they also make you pay for it."</p>    <p>The pandemic has prompted lawmakers around the world to close national borders, and no passport holders have regained the number of visa-free travel destinations they had prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>"I think Americans, and honestly, the world can see what I've seen my whole life, which is that these borders are real, they're sharp and they hurt people," said Samarajiva.</p>  <p>"I can see the absurdity of the situation because [my] kids are basically the same.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="310ca8db" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
				<div>
			
<p>Have you heard about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://jungletopp.com/instacart-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instacart featured products</a>? Chances are more users and marketers have heard of this platform within the last year, especially in 2020. And consumers actually have COVID-19 to thank (if you can believe you’re thanking a pandemic-inducing virus).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those that may not have heard of this platform before, Instacart is an online grocery shopping platform that delivers groceries right to your door. There are personalized shoppers sent out to go grab your order from stores that carry the items you requested. These stores include CVS Pharmacy, Wegmans and Costco among so many others! Pretty cool, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a store that ‘s increased tremendously in business in the past few months too. In March alone, online grocery store shopping went from <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/the-coronavirus-will-cause-a-lasting-step-change-in-grocery-ecommerce" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">11% to 37%</a>, which is a huge jump for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, when we look into the opposite side of sales for the business and move on over to the marketing aspect, there’s a ton for marketers to take a deep dive. Instacart now uses Pacvue to offer self-serve advertising features in order to get their brand’s featured products to the mass market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pacvue is known for hosting advertising features for other monstrously huge companies such as Amazon and Walmart. When Instacart and Pacvue marry each other in the business of advertising, there’s quite a few features that can be achieved between the two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s look into these, shall we?&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Instacart Utilizes a Self-Serve Platform&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Instacart originally launched a self-serve advertising platform as a way to compete with other media outlets and other growing digital retailers. They include some of the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Amazon&nbsp;</li><li>CVS Pharmacy&nbsp;</li><li>Kroger&nbsp;</li><li>Target&nbsp;</li><li>Walmart&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Huge companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and PepsiCo are among the brands that have actually tested the ad platform in the past few months, finding it to be of great value. Its marketplace ads include banners, coupons and delivery promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those to begin their own advertising campaign, marketers need to first set up an account through Instacart. By doing this, it will allow marketers to utilize measurement tools to track campaigns per the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This platform will also help marketers to reach shoppers when they are most ready to buy their groceries and complete the rest of the household shopping for the week. Since the pandemic hit, marketers have been able to highlight branded products on an online presence to customers that may have not seen them any other time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Where Do Instacart Ads Appear?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:369/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-2.jpg" alt="Instacart Featured Products" data-opt-src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:369/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-2.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20369%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22369%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"></figure>



<p>Did you know Instacart offers feature product advertising? Customers will see these ads when they search for related keywords using the Instacart app. They can even search the home page or different department, browse through item details and even check out a personalized section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, the online shopper browses several times before making a purchase. They do this as a form of research, whether they ultimately purchase on the online platform or in stores. Since Instacart knows this, there are several opportunities for featured advertisements like the above to reach the desired audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take ketchup for instance. If someone is looking for a quality brand or one with certain ingredients, the customer might type in a few different keywords. Heinz Ketchup may then pop up for each one at the top. As the customer continues to search, they’ll then be more likely to purchase Heinz as it becomes more apparent as the top result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This feature is similar to Amazon, and conversion will most likely happen when the advertisements pop up at the top of the search.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Instacart Featured Products Use Keyword Bidding&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:156/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.57.06-PM.png" alt="instacart ad platform" data-opt-src="https://mlrsusow8nmv.i.optimole.com/fTRctk8.r9I3~17e1f/w:1024/h:156/q:55/https://jungletopp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.57.06-PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20156%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22156%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"></figure>



<p>This is a platform that uses auctioning and bids for specific keywords. Then the auction is won based on a combination of the CPC bid and relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a look into how it works! If you were to target “chocolate chip cookies” the keyword bid would only be applied to the exact phrase, and it wouldn’t be applied to variations like “chip cookies” or “chocolate chip cookie”.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>They Even Make Sure Your Keywords are Competitive&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Instacart is actually pretty similar to Amazon in the way they operate with their auction model. When marketers are bidding they’re only paying $.01 more than their competition. This particular setup is great for those who want to be competitive in their advertising without going way over their budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To show if you’ve won the bid, Instacart will rate keywords to show the probability of the advertiser winning them for the campaign. The system is also set to be viewed in real time, so you can see the change in bids.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Green, a high probability winning at least 50% of placements&nbsp;</li><li>Yellow, also a high probability of winning at least 25% of placements&nbsp;</li><li>Red, there is no chance of winning any placements</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How Does One Get Started with Instacart?</strong></h3>



<p>There’s four easy steps for getting set up with your own campaign, and you should as this can be super beneficial to your brand! Take a look at the following to see how you can achieve your start.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Learn How to Structure Your Campaigns: </strong>When creating a campaign, there’s actually no SKU limit you have to worry about. However, there is a keyword limit of 1,000 per ad group. But did you know you can have multiple ad groups in the same campaign?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Set Your Budget: </strong>Be conscious of your budget and make sure not to go over. This is best achieved when you set a date for the campaign and monitor spending within that budget you set for yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Exclude Certain Keywords from Campaigns: </strong>Make sure you monitor which words are serving you in the campaign. If the keyword isn’t doing as well as you hoped, you can lower the bid value to minimum in order to focus your efforts elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Get started ASAP: </strong>Instacart has grown tremendously in the last year due to the current pandemic and more shoppers are showing up on this platform. It’s important to get ahead of the game and get the opportunity to showcase your brand’ s voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have you tried out Instacart self-serve advertising before? Let us know what you think about the online platform or if you plan on using it yourself for future marketing campaigns!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQhhcgn8YZo" width="320" youtube-src-id="dQhhcgn8YZo"></iframe></p><p>Nanotechnology could impact gaming by enabling handhelds with better battery life, more immersive virtual reality and faster next gen consoles.&nbsp;</p><h2>Discovering nanotechnology</h2><p>Aged 14, I first discovered nanotechnology when I came across K. Eric Drexler's amazing&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Creation" target="_blank">Engines of Creation</a></i>. In awe of his vision of an age of abundance where we could create anything using nothing but the dirt around us, I lent my copy to my Economics teacher, who was equally impressed at the potential for this wondrous new technology.</p><p>I almost forgot about it when I became an adult and the lure of other things was pulling me in. I'd dip my toes back in to that world whenever I read about a new application or someone was envisioning a new application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn't fully immersed and couldn't imagine the wonderful world of assemblers would happen anytime soon. We would still make things the old way, do things the old way. It was somewhat disheartening but this was reality, no matter how hard you could try to make it go away.&nbsp;</p><p>Lately, though, I've been thinking about technology a lot and how we are on the cusp of doing some amazing things. Developing games has, admittedly, narrowed my focus a little, so in this post I'll be exploring my thoughts for the potential of nanotechnology to transform gaming.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lighter, better handhelds</h3><p>One the major things holding back the potential for truly amazing handhelds (imagine a more powerful GPD Win that could play the latest games or a next generation Switch) is battery life.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding a bulky battery reduces the portability but nanotechnology offers the promise of next gen batteries in addition to improving existing tech.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a lot of research happening in this area (see this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.understandingnano.com/batteries.html" target="_blank">useful list of developments</a>, for example) but my favorite is the idea of using 'nanochains' to extend the lifespan of traditional lithium ion batteries.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.understandingnano.com/antimony-nanochain-battery.html" target="_blank">Researchers at Purdue University</a>&nbsp;conducted research using antimony based 'nanochains' which could lead to more powerful batteries: "The researchers compared the nanochain electrodes to graphite electrodes, finding that when coin cell batteries with the nanochain electrode were only charged for 30 minutes, they achieved double the lithium-ion capacity for 100 charge-discharge cycles."</p><p>These new batteries could lead to lighter handhelds with better CPUs and GPUs and longer battery life.&nbsp;</p><h3>New smells</h3><p>Ah,&nbsp;<i>Smell-O-Vision</i>. The butt of countless jokes since it failed, the idea of technology which could give your nose some type of enjoyment has long been the preserve of science fiction, but nanotechnology could make it happen.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Nanowerk News</i>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news/newsid=43476.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported on the NANOSMELL project&nbsp;</a>which could make this a reality. They wrote that: "The NANOSMELL project aims to switch smells on and off by tagging artificial odorants with nanoparticles exposed to electromagnetic field."</p><p>Gaming applications could be pretty cool if this could be made to work with a console or PC. You could be playing a new&nbsp;<i>Call of Duty</i>&nbsp;and be hit with smell of mud when running through a field or the smell of flowers when playing&nbsp;<i>Fable</i>. There's a lot that could be done.&nbsp;</p><h3>Less Bulky VR And Better Graphics</h3><p>Or what about a new type of skin that could be fantastic for virtual reality? You could feel every piece of the action in an FPS, the touchdown in a&nbsp;<i>Madden</i>&nbsp;game or the textures in a wood in an&nbsp;<i>Elder Scrolls</i>&nbsp;game. That could be one possibility with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news2/newsid=53685.php" target="_blank">this new artificial skin&nbsp;</a>reported by&nbsp;<i>Nanowerk News&nbsp;</i>last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Something we can all appreciate is better graphics. Researchers from the Australian National University developed a nano-antenna to transmit data at amazing speed. An article at the time from<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-20/gamers-promised-faster-graphics-in-nano-technology-breakthrough/8724546" target="_blank">&nbsp;ABC News</a>&nbsp;wrote: "An international team of scientists, based in Australia and Germany, designed a tiny antenna — 100 times thinner than a human hair — which could improve the speed at which data is processed for games."</p><h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3><p>Nanotechnology promises to transform every area of gaming. From new handhelds with incredible battery life to immersive virtual reality, there is a lot to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

</figure>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5
fc:1
draw:{,(;,"blue";5 5#0)}
</code></pre>

</figure>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

</figure>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

					<div><h2>A brief history of keeping cool</h2><p>Humans have been trying to beat the heat since the beginning of civilization. For example people everywhere from the steppes of Kyrgyzstan to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona have been using a building material called adobe to keep their homes cool during the day and warm during the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century a New Yorker named Willis Carrier invented the first modern electric air conditioner. At first, units were expensive and bulky, so only large buildings like movie theaters had AC. But by the middle of the century costs and sizes dropped and adoption of in-home air conditioning skyrocketed in America.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone was so quick to accept air conditioning, however. In fact, for a short time, the technology was morally controversial. As the Smithsonian’s Peter Liebhold wrote, “There was this notion that trying to control the environment was going against God’s will.”</p></div>

Ten years later in 1927, GE released the “Monitor-top” fridge, which would go on to sell one million units. By 1960 nearly every American home had a fridge.&nbsp;<span>Around that time the first window-unit air conditioner was invented, which made air conditioning more accessible.

					<div><h3>The solution isn’t as simple as turning down the thermostat</h3><p>It’s easy to dismiss air conditioning as an unnecessary comfort (especially if you grew up in a house without it, like I did). But for many air conditioning and other cooling technologies are a matter of life and death, especially in low-income countries.</p><p><strong>It protects against heat waves</strong></p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 12,000 people die from <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/energy/Publications/2018-clean-cold-report.pdf">heat waves</a> globally every year. Due to climate change, that number could rise as high as 250,000 as cities around the world heat up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It enables modern medicine</strong></p><p>Cooling technology is also essential to modern medicine. The WHO estimates that 150,000 people die every year due to broken “cold chains.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It prevents food-born illnesses</strong></p><p>If you haven’t had food poisoning recently, you can thank the cold chain. 420,000 people weren’t so lucky in the last year and died due to contaminated food.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

					<div><h3>How cooling technologies cause climate change</h3><p>While air conditioning and refrigerants make modern life possible, the greenhouse gases they emit contribute significantly to climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>These technologies cause climate change in two primary ways.</p><p><strong>Energy usage<br></strong>Air conditioners make up about 20% of electricity usage in the average American home. And today most of that electricity is generated from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Leaky hydrofluorocarbons</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>A lesser known cause of climate change are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</p><p>Prior to the 1980s most AC units and fridges used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) coolants as a refrigerating fluid. But then scientists discovered their link to ozone depletion. In 1987 world leaders gathered in Montreal and agreed to ban the use of these gases (Ah, what a simple time… When world leaders listened to scientists).&nbsp;</p><p>Most companies replaced CFCs with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which was bad news for the stability of Earth’s climate. As a greenhouse gas these new HFCs are anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 times more potent than CO2. Today HFCs account for 1% of global emissions. But they are growing at an alarming rate of 10-15% per year.</p></div>

					<div><h3>The Most Effective Things You Can Do To Help Solve This Problem</h3>
<p>To take effective climate action you don’t need to be a climate scientist or policy wonk. Everyone reading this can do something to help reduce emissions from the cooling sector. Below I’ll cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>A summary of the best proposed solutions to this problem&nbsp;</li>
<li>The most effective steps you can take to be a part of the solution (ranked by impact)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The best proposed solutions</strong></p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, the UN released <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33094/CoolRep.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">a report</a> detailing how we can cut 460 billion tons of cumulative global emissions over the next four decades. For context, that’s as many emissions as the world produces in eight years. The report can be broken down into two primary recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase efficiency</strong> — Right now most cooling equipment sold isn’t the most efficient. In the United States the most efficient model on the market is 3x more efficient than the least.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Phase out HFCs</strong> — If we banned HFCs today like we did CFCs during the ozone crisis, we could avoid 53 billion tons of emissions over the next 40 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok so that’s what we — as in the big, global we — need to do. But what can me and you do?</p>
<p><strong>The most effective thing you can do is get involved politically.</strong></p>
<p>The most effective lever we as a world have to dramatically cut emissions is policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But before your eyes glaze over, hear me out. Policy isn’t some thing that wonks in windowless rooms write and then pass into law. Most barriers to policy are political. And most politicians don’t pass bold climate policy because they think you don’t want it (and many of them get lobbied by fossil fuel companies).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But no amount of fossil fuel money could prevent bold climate action if everyone who cared about the environment voted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today less than half of Americans vote. About a quarter of young people vote. So the most effective thing you can do is vote for green candidates, then get your friends to vote, and then organize your community to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://erikareinhardt.com/personal-climate-action">Erika Reinhardt</a> put together a great guide on how to do this effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The second best thing you can do is reduce your home’s emissions</strong></p>
<p>The average American emits 20 tons of CO2 every year. About 5 of those come from your home. And the vast majority of those emissions come from three places: your air conditioning, heater, and hot water heater.</p>
<p>If you can afford to replace any of these pieces of equipment with more efficient equipment, you can make a big impact. But some of these systems cost thousands of dollars. So if you can’t just remember to prioritize efficiency when you eventually have to replace them. (In my next story I’m going to go over this in more detail).</p>
<p><strong>Don’t buy fridges or AC units with HFCs</strong></p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned that HFCs are 1,000-3,000 more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2? Well, the odds are pretty good that you have some of them in your house. That’s because most AC units and fridges sold until recently used them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And amazingly, while most countries have banned them, the United States hasn’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a quick guide to the good and bad ones to watch for:</p>

DNS-over-HTTPS isn’t used by Firefox and Google because it’s </span><i><span>superior</span></i><span> to DoT. It’s used because browsers operate at the HTTPS layer by default, so DNS-over-TLS doesn’t make sense (as things stand now) for a browser to implement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Google can’t use DNS-over-TLS in their browser because they can’t modify the code on Windows or MacOS operating systems (which only support DoT at the moment)&nbsp; in order to encrypt DNS requests done outside of the browser. And that works for Google and Firefox, because they only need to encrypt DNS requests </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> of their browsers.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile at DNSFilter, we need to operate DNS encryption not just in the browser, but at the operating system level. That’s why we use DNS-over-TLS: Because it can be enabled at a </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> layer and protect DNS requests outside of the browser (e.g. Slack messages, links embedded in Excel, or miscellaneous desktop applications). And right now, DoT is the primary way to enable standardized DNS encryption at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that DoH is being enabled at the OS level for new versions of iOS, MacOS, and Windows. Because Android is a Google product, and Google Chrome uses DoH, Android devices are already using DoH at the operating system level.</span></p><h2><span>Which is better?</span></h2><p><span>DoH is on everyone’s minds because it’s what Google uses, but it’s not necessarily </span><i><span>better</span></i><span> than DoT. It’s just </span><i><span>different</span></i><span>, and in some ways it’s actually inferior to DoT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a lot of ways, DoT is more efficient because of which layer within the TCP/IP model it is enabled in. Remember, DoH is </span><b>two</b><span> layers removed from the internet layer while DoT is only </span><b>one</b><span> layer removed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because there is another layer of encapsulation in DoH, it results in:</span></p><ul><li><span>More coding required</span></li><li><span>More libraries required</span></li><li><span>Packet sizes are larger than DoT</span></li><li><span>Ever-so-slightly higher latency</span></li></ul><p><span>These are a few of the reasons why DNSFilter chose DoT over DoH. Basically, we would have needed to send more data across another layer. Though it should be noted that both DoT </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> DoH increase latency, DoT has lower latency because of where it’s enabled.</span></p><p><span>But the most important reason for us, and our users, in choosing DoT was the ability to enable DNS encryption at the </span><i><span>lowest possible layer</span></i><span> since our users do not just send DNS requests over their browsers. That’s why we use DoT.</span></p><p><span>But that doesn’t mean we think DoT is the </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> answer. We </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> planning on having a DoH implementation for clients who need it.</span></p><p><span>As an example, Android devices, such as Chromebooks, use DoH. This is because Android devices were created by Google. While Windows and MacOS do not currently support DoH, Google was able to modify their Android devices so that DoH would be possible.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-adding-dns-over-https-doh-to-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Microsoft has even announced adding support for DoH</span></a><span>, while also keeping their DoT support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though, just because Microsoft supports DoH for their operating system doesn’t mean the higher latency or additional coding requirements go away. No matter what, DoH is still implemented at a higher layer than DoT. The only change would be that now DoH can be implemented at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This addition of DoH support is likely less about Microsoft giving their users more options and more about them following Google’s lead.</span></p><h2><span>Other DNS protocol variations</span></h2><p><span>DoH and DoT are not the only encryption protocols available, though at this point they are more robust and the most widely used. But before encryption standards were available, there was also DNSSEC.</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC was an early DNS standard that provided </span><i><span>no</span></i><span> encryption or privacy for your DNS requests. It </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. And if it is not applied properly, it will </span><i><span>break</span></i><span> your website. </span><a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>You can check out a feed of websites broken by improper DNSSEC implementations here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC is prone to frequent outages and it was never widely adopted. Due to that, and because it only does a portion of what DoH and DoT do, are just a few reasons that at DNSFilter we don’t recommend using DNSSEC, though we do support it.</span></p><p><span>DNSCrypt is another DNS encryption option, though far less popular than the two protocols we’re comparing right now. Like DNS-over-TLS, it is applied at the transport layer. DNSCrypt prevents localized man-in-the-middle attacks and encrypts DNS traffic between the user and recursive DNS servers, though it does not provide end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the biggest difference between DNSCrypt and other standards (like DoT) is that there is no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RFC</span></a><span> (Request for Comments) like there is for DoH or DoT. This means it hasn’t been peer-reviewed and battle-tested. Implementations can vary greatly, and all of the definitions and specifications for DNSCrypt come from a single source.</span></p><p><span>You can access the RFCs for </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoH</span></a><span> here.</span></p><h2><span>DNS encryption is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> evolving</span></h2><p><span>There is no right answer when it comes to DoT or DoH, because these standards support varying use cases. But if DoH continues to be adopted like it has been, we might see DoT go by the wayside.</span></p><p><span>With that being said, it’s not just a matter of choosing DoT or DoH. There is still work that needs to be done in both DNS encryption </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> SNI (Server Name Indication) encryption.</span></p><p><span>SNI is the layer above TLS and an extension of the TLS layer. Once you make a DNS request and TLS makes a secure connection with that IP address, SNI tells the server in clear text (not encrypted) what the name of that domain is. While this does not impact things like man-in-the-middle attacks, it </span><i><span>does</span></i><span> impact privacy. Currently, SNI is </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> encrypted, though it is something that is being worked on.</span></p><p><span>While DoT and DoH are the most secure and standardized methods for encrypting DNS, they </span><i><span>do not</span></i><span> encrypt the request that goes to the authoritative DNS. That request is received in clear text. This is a point of vulnerability in both DoT and DoH, as well as DNSCrypt. Right now there is no standard for encrypting this information.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" alt="authoritative dns" width="600" height="145" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w"></p><p>As a DNS resolver, we support and welcome a standard for encrypting messages to authoritative DNS, and we’d love to work with providers to help put this in place.</p><p><span>But the point I’m trying to make here is that neither DoT nor DoH are perfect DNS encryption solutions at this moment. More work still needs to be done, like enabling 0-RTT for all DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS implementations.</span></p><p><span>While everyone is talking about DoH, it’s not because it’s the most secure or most efficient solution. It’s because right now, it’s the solution that’s getting the most press. </span><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-vhs-beat-betamax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>When VHS overtook Betamax</span></a><span>, it wasn’t because VHS was better in every way. Betamax actually provided better video quality, but VHS was cheaper and allowed people to record longer programs. VHS and Betamax both achieve the same end (recording and displaying video), </span><a href="https://www.infosecmonkey.com/2019/11/19/betamax-doh-vs-vhs-dot-in-the-secure-dns-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>similar to how DoT and DoH both provide encryption</span></a><span> through slightly different methods.</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest impacts of the “DoH vs. DoT” debate is the way MSPs implement network-level DNS filtering. With DoH becoming the de facto standard, it makes performing DoH bypasses on system-level DNS settings nearly impossible. There’s no standard method at this time for alternative workarounds. We’ll go into this subject in more detail in a later blog post, as there is a lot to consider when discussing the impact on MSPs.</span></p><p><span>For more reading on DNS-over-TLS and how it’s implemented by DNSFilter, </span><a href="https://docs.dnsfilter.com/docs/dns-over-tls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visit our support documentation</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

</ul>
<img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2805509/driving-radius.jpg" width="620" alt="commute-radius-paris">
<p>You can add more than one start location to your commute time map to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat sharing: plot all work locations for all flatmates to see which locations would provide the best commute</li>
<li>Family home search: plot school locations and work locations to see where's a good spot for all of the family</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use our commute calculator</h2>
<p>1. Open our <a href="https://app.traveltime.com/" rel=" noopener"><strong>free commute map tool</strong></a> - no sign up required&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Enter a start location, such as your office, a school, your current home location or somewhere else important&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2805509/Screenshot%202020-07-28%20at%2015.36.00.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020-07-28 at 15.36.00" width="1274"></p>
<p>3. Select your maximum commute time. This free tool allows you to select a time up until 2 hours, using 5 minute increments. For example 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour 15 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: it's possible to make a commute map using 2+ hours travel time, but can't be done using this demo tool. To do this you'll need to use the <a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/introduction" rel=" noopener"><strong>TravelTime API</strong></a> or <strong><a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/qgis/tutorials/basic-tutorial" rel=" noopener">QGIS plugin </a></strong>or <strong><a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/arcgis/about/overview" rel=" noopener">ArcGIS plugin</a></strong>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>4. Select your preferred mode of transport. To understand <strong><a href="https://traveltime.com/turn-radius-maps-into-travel-time" rel=" noopener">how we calculate each transport mode area view our model here.</a></strong></p>

<p>When selecting public transport the tool calculates commute time area based on how long it takes to depart your start location and get on any timetabled transport mode. The user then must have time to reach the stop and exit the station on the other side. This sometimes means that a 30 minute area looks different at slightly different times of the day.&nbsp;</p>

July 28, 2020 | https://mlu.red/muse/52906366310.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mlu.red/muse/52906366310.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog post is my attempt to give an overview of the sub-field of machine learning interpretability. I do not intend for this post to be necessarily comprehensive, but my goal is to review conceptual frameworks, existing research, and future directions.</p>
<h2>What Are Existing Overviews?</h2>
<p>Most of these ideas are based heavily off of Zach Lipton's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf">Mythos of Model Interpretability</a>, which I think is the best paper for understanding the different definitions of interpretability. For a deeper dive into specific techniques, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01933.pdf">A Survey Of Methods For Explaining Black Box Models</a> which covers a wide variety of approaches for many different ML well as model-agnostic approaches. For neural nets specifically, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14545.pdf">Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated</a> provides an in-depth read. For other conceptual surveys of the field, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/44/22071">Definitions, methods, and applications in interpretable machine learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08883.pdf">Explainable Machine Learning for Scientific Insights and Discoveries</a>. The Explainable Machine Learning paper in particular is quite nice because it gives a hierarchy of increasingly more interpretable models across several domains and use cases.</p>
<p>(Shout-out to <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/d516daff247f7157fccde6649ace91d969cd1973/The-Mythos-of-Model-Interpretability/">Connected Papers</a> which made navigating the paper landscape for interpretability very bearable.)</p>
<p>As always, you can find code used to generate the images <a href="https://github.com/owenshen24/interp-exp">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we'll go over many ways to formalize what "interpretability" means. Broadly, interpretability focuses on the <em>how</em>. It's focused on getting some notion of an explanation for the decisions made by our models. Below, each section is operationalized by a concrete question we can ask of our ML model using a specific definition of interpretability. Before that, though, if you're new to all this, I'll explain briefly about why we might care about interpretability at all.</p>
<h2>Why Care About Interpretability?</h2>
<p>Firstly, interpretability in ML is useful because it can aid in trust. As humans, we may be reluctant to rely on ML models for certain critical tasks , e.g. medical diagnosis, unless we know "how they work". There's often a fear of unknown unknowns when trusting in something opaque, which we see when people confront new technology. Approaches to interpretability which focus on transparency could help mitigate some of these fears.</p>
<p>Secondly, safety. There is almost always some sort of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v1.pdf">shift in distributions</a> between model training and deployment. Failures to generalize or Goodhart's Law issues like <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-AI-ingenuity">specification gaming</a> are still open problems that could lead to issues in the near future. Approaches to interpretability which explain the model's representations or which features are most relevant could help diagnose these issues earlier and provide more opportunities to intervene.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and perhaps most interestingly, contestability. As we delegate more decision-making to ML models, it becomes important for people to appeal these decisions made. Black-box models provide no such recourse because they don't decompose into anything that <em>can</em> be contested. This has already led to major criticism of proprietary recidivism predictors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)#Critiques_and_legal_rulings">COMPAS</a>. Approaches to interpretability which focus on decomposing the model into sub-models or explicate a chain of reasoning could help with such appeals.</p>

<p>Lipton's paper breaks interpretability down into two types, transparency and post-hoc.</p>
<h2>Transparency Interpretability</h2>
<p>These three questions are from Lipton's section on transparency as interpretability, where he features on properties of the model that are useful to understand and can be known before training begins.</p>
<h3>Can a human walk through the model's steps? (Simulatibility)</h3>
<p>This property is about whether or not a human could go through each step of the algorithm and have it make sense to them at each step. Linear models and decision trees are often cited as interpretable models using such justifications; the computation they require is simple, no fancy matrix operations or nonlinear transformations.</p>
<p>Linear models are also nice because the parameters themselves have a very direct mapping–they represent how important different input features are. For example, I trained a linear classifier on MNIST, and here are some of the weights, each of which correspond to a pixel value:</p>
<pre><code>0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  3.90594519e-05,  7.10306823e-05,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00, -1.47542413e-03,
-1.67811041e-04, -3.83280468e-02, -8.10846867e-02, -5.01943218e-02,
-2.90314621e-02, -2.65494116e-02, -8.29385683e-03,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  1.67390785e-04,  3.92789141e-04,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00
</code></pre>
<p>By themselves, these weights are hard to interpret. Even if we knew which pixels they corresponded to, it's difficult to try and pin down what a certain pixel even represents for large images. However, there is an easy trick to turn these weights into something interpretable. We simply reshape them into the same shape as our model and view it as an image, with the pixel color represented by the weight value.</p>
<p>Here are the weights for the model that looks for 0:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-0.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 0 highlighted"></p>
<p>And here are the weights for the model that looks for 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-3.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 3 highlighted"></p>
<p>In both cases, we can see that the blue regions, which represent positive weight, correspond to a configuration of pixels that look roughly like the digit being detected for. In the case of 0, we can see a distinct blank spot in the center of the image and a curve-like shape around it, whereas the curves of the 3 are also apparent.</p>
<p>However, Lipton points out that this desiderata can be less about the specific choice of model and more about the <em>size</em> of the model. A decision tree with a billion nodes, for example, may still be difficult to understand. Understanding is also about being able to hold most of the model in your mind, which is often about how the model is parameterized.</p>
<p>One approach towards achieving this for neural nets is <a href="http://www.shallowmind.co/jekyll/pixyll/2017/12/30/tree-regularization/">tree regularization</a> which adds a regularization term that corresponds (roughly) to the size of the decision tree that can approximate the net being trained. The hope here is to eventually output a shallow decision tree that performs comparably to a neural net. Another approach is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00221.pdf">neural backed decision trees</a> which use another type of regularization to learn a hierarchy over class labels, which then get used to form a decision tree.</p>
<p>Of course, parameterization is not the whole story. There are methods like K-Nearest Neighbors which are parameterized by your entire dataset; this could be billions of points. Yet, there is a sense in which KNN is still interpretable despite its massive size. We can cleanly describe what the algorithm does, and we can even see "why" it made such a choice because the algorithm is so simple.</p>
<h3>Is the model interpretable at every step, or with regards to its sub-components? (Decomposability)</h3>
<p>Another desirable feature would be to understand what the model is doing at each step. For example, imagine a decision tree whose nodes correspond to easily identifiable factors like age or height. This can sometimes be difficult because model performance is very tightly coupled with the representations used. Raw features, e.g. RGB pixel values, are often not very interpretable by themselves, but interpretable features may not be the most informative for the model.</p>
<p>For example, I trained a decision tree for MNIST using the following interpretable features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The average brightness of the image - <code>avg_lumin</code></li>
<li>The average brightness of the image's outline (found using an edge detector) - <code>edge_prop</code></li>
<li>The number of corners found in the image's outline <code>num_corners</code></li>
<li>The width of the image - <code>max_width</code></li>
<li>The height of the image - <code>max_height</code></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like there would be at least <em>some</em> useful information in these features; ones tend to have less area (so <code>avg_lumin</code> would be lower), eights might have more corners, etc. etc. Yet, the resulting decision tree of depth 3, shown below, however, only achieves 33% training accuracy. Going all the way to depth 10 only bumps it to around 50%.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/interp_mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a decision tree trained on MNIST with interpretable features"></p>
<p>If we look at the nodes, we can perhaps see what's going on. At the top, we can see that our model will predict a 1 if the width is less than 7.5 pixels, which makes sense as 1 is likely going to be the thinnest digit. Near the bottom, we see that the number of corners is being used to differentiate between 7 and 4. And 4s do have more visual corners than 7s. But this is very rough, and the overall performance is still not very good.</p>
<p>To compare this with raw features, I also trained a depth 3 decision tree using direct pixel values, i.e. a vector of 784 grayscale values. The resulting model, shown below, gets 50% train and test accuracy.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a normal decision tree trained on MNIST"></p>
<p>Here, it's not clear at all why these pixel values were chosen to be the splitting points. And yet the resulting decision tree, for the same number of nodes, does much better. In this simple case, the performance vs interpretability trade-off in representation is quite apparent.</p>
<h3>Does the algorithm itself confer any guarantees? (Algorithmic Transparency)</h3>
<p>This asks if our learning algorithm has any properties which make it easy to understand. For example, we might know that the algorithm only outputs sparse models, or perhaps it always converges to a certain type of solution. In these cases, the resulting learned model can be more amenable to analysis. For example, the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Labs/UniquenessOfSVM.pdf">Hard Margin SVM</a> is guaranteed to find a unique solution which maximizes the margin. In another vein, the <a href="https://owenshen24.github.io/perceptron/">perceptron</a> is guaranteed to find parameters (not necessarily unique ones, though) that achieve a training loss of 0 if the data are linearly separable.</p>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, I'm less familiar with these kinds of results. My rough understanding is that the equivalence class of models which achieve comparable training error can be quite large, even with regularization, which makes uniqueness results hard to come by.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier with KNN, it seems, aside from mechanical transparency, …</p></div></div>

                    <p>It takes a while to gather, clean and train your model. Optimizing hyper-parameters, fine tuning, searching for the best architecture takes a while. After all that hard work, it's finally time to deploy your model. </p><p>Supposing you trained a very accurate model. In this short tutorial you'll learn how to deploy that Scikit model to the Inferrd platform. It's very easy and fast.</p><h3 id="let-s-get-started">Let's Get Started</h3><p>The first step in deploying a model to the cloud is saving that model. You need to get your Scikit model into a format that is easily uploadable. Thankfully, it's literally a one-liner.</p><p>All you need is the <code>joblib</code> library, a simple serialization package that takes care of everything.</p><pre><code>pip install joblib</code></pre><p>Then, simply dump your model into a file called <code>my_scikit_model.joblib</code></p><pre><code>import scikit
from joblib import dump

model = # define your model and train it

# more training involved
dump(model, 'my_scikit_model.joblib')
</code></pre><p>At this point, you should have a file called <code>my_scikit_model.joblib</code>.</p><h3 id="second-and-final-step">Second and Final Step</h3><p>That <code>.joblib</code> file is all you need for Inferrd. Simply head over to <a href="https://app.inferrd.com/register">your dashboard</a>, create a new model and drop that <code>joblib</code> file in the upload zone.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.40.15-PM.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Give Inferrd around one minute to fully deploy your model.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a data company, data ethics has always been important to us, but in the last few years, as Machine learning and AI have become front and centre as a significant part of digital transformation in the enterprise, data ethics has become a hot topic. It bears such a considerable weight in predictive analytics, not just in conveying trust to consumers of machine intelligence, but also in ensuring predictive models deliver genuine value, make unbiased predictions, and reflect the true state of the environment within which they live. When data ethics go wrong, it can go badly wrong, potentially bringing down an entire organisation, with substantial direct and indirect collateral damage, potentially even on national democracy and social cohesion - the Cambridge Analytica incident a case in point.</p><p>We all need to take it seriously.</p><p>In 2018 Data Language was privileged to have been accepted onto the Digital Catapult “<a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/for-startups/acceleration-programmes/machine-intelligence-garage">Machine Intelligence Garage</a>” programme. As well as supporting us with a terrific programme including compute resource, strategic help and industry engagement, Digital Catapult also took Data Language through their ethics programme. This was like a cold-shower, really waking us up to depth and breadth of data ethics. A realisation that data ethics is not just about data (technically), but about the way you approach your entire business. </p><p>With all this in mind, we were motivated to develop a data ethics framework that we could use internally at Data Language to assess all our predictive analytics projects, and that could guide us practically during implementation. We call this framework BOTT.</p><h2 id="the-bott-framework">The BOTT Framework</h2><p>BOTT (all good frameworks need a memorable acronym) stands for Bias, Outcome, Target and Trust. Through these four pillars, it allows our data science team to examine, and assess a predictive analytics model within its local and external ecosystem for quality, bias, and accuracy, and ensure it meets high standards of data ethics.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg" alt="Data Language BOTT Data Ethics Framework" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w2400/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="bias">Bias</h3><p>An analysis of potential bias that may be baked into the model during its life-cycle, either literally through data or code, or intangibly through for example, some conscious or subconscious human bias. We examine bias from the following perspectives :</p><p><em><strong>Training data bias</strong></em> - is the training data diverse enough and comprehensive enough to accurately reflect the environment of the predictive model. What potential biases might skew predictive results either for good or bad outcomes - is there any chance these biases might exist in the training data we have used.</p><p><em><strong>Algorithmic bias</strong></em><strong> </strong>- is the model algorithm, its mathematical basis, or code potentially biased?</p><p><em><strong>Real-time input data</strong></em><strong> </strong>- if real-time (predict time) input data is involved in making some prediction, what might these data biases be, and how can we prevent them from impacting outputs.</p><p><strong><em>Team bias</em></strong> - has or could conscious or unconscious bias of the model development team contribute to model bias, and have we mitigated against it. Often just an open and frank team discussion around bias (with respect to the project under consideration) is enough to flush out these sort of issues</p><p><strong><em>Political, environmental, and social bias</em> </strong>- similar to the team bias but looking at potential external factors through a similar lens - for both ideally the team needs to be very comfortable talking about potentially politically or socially sensitive topics in an open, friendly and non-defensive manner.</p><p><strong><em>Output sampling</em></strong> - essentially QA - have you done effective output sampling and for quality assurance - does the risk of bias in the predictive model call for independent third party reviews in QA workflows, etc</p><h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3><p>An analysis and survey of the full range of possible outcomes of the model:</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - construct a catalogue of the potential outcome scenarios</p><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - What does success and failure of the model mean :</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>in the context of the target use-cases</li>
<li>best and worst case scenario modelling</li>
<li>model failure consequences, e.g. could somebody die if the model fails ?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="target">Target</h3><p>Analysis of who or what the model is targeted at and the context in which these users operate.</p><p><strong><em>Users</em></strong> - &nbsp;Who are target users of the model &nbsp;- who or what is the direct consumer of the model ?</p><p><strong><em>Purpose</em></strong> - What problem is the model solving?</p><p><strong><em>Context</em>: </strong>Is it part of an ensemble of models, is there a wider predictive ecosystem the model sits within - what impact does this model have within this context ?</p><p><strong><em>Life span</em></strong> - &nbsp;What is the life expectancy of the model, and how does its environment change over time</p><p><strong><em>Subversion</em> </strong> - Can other users or consumers subvert the model for unintended/undesirable ends?</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - Construct &nbsp;a catalogue of potential unintended uses/consequences, and ascertain if those vulnerabilities can be designed out of the architecture?</p><h3 id="trust">Trust</h3><p>Providing some visibility of the "behind the scenes" implementation can raise confidence in the models and foster a trust relationship between consumers and predictive services.</p><p><strong><em>Explainable AI</em></strong> (XAI) is becoming a field in its own right, and an important part of machine learning and predictive analytics. Codable frameworks are emerging to aid explainability (for example <a href="https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about">Google Model Cards</a>). This codability will be key in being able to compare and assess models through some normative evaluation mechanism.</p><p><strong><em>Transparency</em></strong> &nbsp;- what should we be exposing of the lineage and decision making pipeline of the model prediction algorithm :</p><ul><li>training cycles / training samples</li><li>outputs of intermediate predictions</li><li>decision inputs/outputs</li></ul><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - Why should these be exposed ? - perform an impact analysis of the possible effects of not exposing model lineage, with respect to legal, environmental, and model improvement consequences.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Most of the programming languages are open enough to allow programmers doing things multiple ways for the similar outcome. JavaScript is no way different. With JavaScript, we often find multiple ways of doing things for a similar outcome, and that's confusing at times.</p>
<p>Some of the usages are better than the other alternatives and thus, these are my favorites. I am going to list them here in this article. I am sure, you will find many of these in your list too.</p>
<h2 id="1-forget-string-concatenation-use-template-string-literal-">1. Forget string concatenation, use template string(literal)</h2>
<p>Concatenating strings together using the <code>+</code> operator to build a meaningful string is old school. Moreover, concatenating strings with dynamic values(or expressions) could lead to frustrations and bugs.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageConcat = <span>'Mr. '</span> + name + <span>' is from '</span> + place + <span>'. He is a'</span> + <span>' '</span> + isPrime(<span>'P'</span>) + <span>' member.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Template literals(or Template strings) allow embedding expressions. It has got unique syntax where the string has to be enclosed by the backtick (``).  Template string can contain placeholders for dynamic values. These are marked by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).</p>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating it,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageTemplateStr = <span>`Mr. <span>${name}</span> is from <span>${place}</span>. He is a <span>${isPrime('P')}</span> member.`</span>
<span>console</span>.log(messageTemplateStr);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-isinteger">2. isInteger</h2>
<p>There is a much cleaner way to know if a value is an integer. The <code>Number</code> API of JavaScript provides a method called, <code>isInteger()</code> to serve this purpose. It is very useful and better to be aware.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> mynum = <span>123</span>;
<span>let</span> mynumStr = <span>"123"</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynum}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynum));
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynumStr}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynumStr));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930285107/RiLxixUxC.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="2.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-value-as-number">3. Value as Number</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed, <code>event.target.value</code> always returns a string type value even when the input box is of type number?</p>
<p>Yes, see the example below. We have a simple text box of type number. It means it accepts only numbers as input. It has an event handler to handle the key-up events.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span>=<span>'number'</span> <span>onkeyup</span>=<span>"trackChange(event)"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the event handler method we take out the value using <code>event.target.value</code>. But it returns a string type value. Now I will have additional headache to parse it to an integer. What if the input box accepts floating numbers(like, 16.56)? parseFloat() then? Ah, all sort of confusions and extra work!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>trackChange</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   <span>let</span> value = event.target.value;
   <span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(value));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>event.target.valueAsNumber</code> instead. It returns the value as number.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> valueAsNumber = event.target.valueAsNumber;
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(valueAsNumber));
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595935455526/Tv1sEFRxe.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="3.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-short-hand-with-and">4. Short hand with AND</h2>
<p>Lets consider a situation where we have a boolean value and a function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isPrime = <span>true</span>;
<span>const</span> startWatching = () =&gt; {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Started Watching!'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is too much code to check for the boolean condition and invoke the function,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (isPrime) {
    startWatching();
}
</code></pre>
<p>How about using the short-hand using the AND(&amp;&amp;) operator? Yes, avoid <code>if</code> statement altogether. Cool, right?</p>
<pre><code>isPrime &amp;&amp; startWatching();
</code></pre>
<h2 id="5-default-value-with-or">5. Default value with OR</h2>
<p>If you ever like to set a default value for a variable, you can do it using the OR(||) operator easily.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> person = {name: <span>'Jack'</span>};
<span>let</span> age = person.age || <span>35</span>; 
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`Age of <span>${person.name}</span> is <span>${age}</span>`</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="6-randoms">6. Randoms</h2>
<p>Generating random number or getting a random item from an array are very useful methods to keep handy. I have seen them appearing multiple times in many of my projects.</p>
<p>Get a random item from an array,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> planets = [<span>'Mercury '</span>, <span>'Mars'</span>, <span>'Venus'</span>, <span>'Earth'</span>, <span>'Neptune'</span>, <span>'Uranus'</span>, <span>'Saturn'</span>, <span>'Jupiter'</span>];
<span>let</span> randomPlanet = planets[<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * planets.length)];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'Random Planet'</span>, randomPlanet);
</code></pre>
<p>Generate a random number from a range by specifying the min and max values,</p>
<pre><code> <span>let</span> getRandom = (min, max) =&gt; {
     <span>return</span> <span>Math</span>.round(<span>Math</span>.random() * (max - min) + min);
 }
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Get random'</span>, getRandom(<span>0</span>, <span>10</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="7-function-default-params">7. Function default params</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, function arguments(or params) are like local variables to that function. You may or may not pass values for those while invoking the function. If you do not pass a value for a param, it will be <code>undefined</code> and may cause some unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>There is a simple way to pass a default value to the function parameters while defining them. Here is an example where we are passing the default value <code>Hello</code> to the parameter <code>message</code> of the <code>greetings</code> function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name, message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>));
<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>, <span>'Hola!'</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="8-required-function-params">8. Required Function Params</h2>
<p>Expanding on the default parameter technique, we can mark a parameter as mandatory. First define a function to throw an error with an error message,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isRequired = () =&gt; {
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>'This is a mandatory parameter.'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then assign the function as the default value for the required parameters. Remember, the default values are ignored when a value is passed for a parameter at the invocation time. But, the default value is considered if the parameter value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name=isRequired(), message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;
}
<span>console</span>.log(greetings());
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, <code>name</code> will be undefined and that will try to set the default value for it which is the <code>isRequired()</code> function. It will throw an error as,</p>

<h2 id="9-comma-operator">9. Comma Operator</h2>
<p>I was surprised when I realized, comma(,) is a separate operator and never gone noticed. I have been using it so much in code but, never realized its true existence.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the comma(,) operator is used for evaluating each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> count = <span>1</span>;
<span>let</span> ret = (count++, count);
<span>console</span>.log(ret);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the value of the variable <code>ret</code> will be, 2.  Similar way, the output of the following code will be logging the value 32 into the console.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> val = (<span>12</span>, <span>32</span>);
<span>console</span>.log(val);
</code></pre>
<p>Where do we use it? Any guesses? The most common usage of the comma(,) operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i = <span>0</span>, j = <span>50</span>; i &lt;= <span>50</span>; i++, j--)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="10-merging-multiple-objects">10.  Merging multiple objects</h2>
<p>You may have a need to merge two objects together and create a better informative object to work with. You can use the spread operator <code>...</code>(yes, three dots!).</p>
<p>Consider two objects, emp and job respectively,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emp = {
 <span>'id'</span>: <span>'E_01'</span>,
 <span>'name'</span>: <span>'Jack'</span>,
 <span>'age'</span>: <span>32</span>,
 <span>'addr'</span>: <span>'India'</span>
};

<span>let</span> job = {
 <span>'title'</span>: <span>'Software Dev'</span>,
  <span>'location'</span>: <span>'Paris'</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Merge them using the spread operator as,</p>
<pre><code> 
 <span>let</span> merged = {...emp, ...job};
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Spread merged'</span>, merged);
</code></pre>
<p>There is another way to perform this merge. Using <code>Object.assign()</code>. You can do it like,</p>
<pre><code> <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Object assign'</span>, <span>Object</span>.assign({}, emp, job));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930544621/2jCCxCSnz.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="10.png"></p>
<p>Note, both spread operator and the Object.assign perform a shallow merge. In a shallow merge, the properties of the first object are overwritten with the same property values of the second object.</p>
<p>For deep merge, please use something like, <code>_merge</code> of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a>.</p>
<h2 id="11-destructuring">11. Destructuring</h2>
<p>The technique of breaking down the array elements and object properties as variables called, <code>destructuring</code>.  Let us see it with few examples,</p>
<h3 id="array">Array</h3>
<p>Here we have an array of emojis,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>To destructure, we would use a syntax as follows,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fire, clock, , watermelon] = emojis;
</code></pre>
<p>This is same as doing, <code>let fire = emojis[0];</code> but with lots more flexibility.
Have you noticed, I have just ignored the trophy emoji using an empty space in-between? So what will be the output of this?</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(fire, clock, watermelon);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595931639636/TXaeEwgGq.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.png"></p>
<p>Let me also introduce something called <code>rest</code> operator here. If you want to destructure an array such that, you want to assign one or more items to variables and park rest of it into another array, you can do that using <code>...rest</code> as shown below.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fruit, ...rest] = emojis;
<span>console</span>.log(rest);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932001526/GdWuvDoP8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.a.png"></p>
<h3 id="object">Object</h3>
<p>Like arrays we can also destructure objects. </p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shape = {
  name: <span>'rect'</span>,
  sides: <span>4</span>,
  height: <span>300</span>,
  width: <span>500</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Destructuring such that, we get name, sides in couple of variables and rest are in another object.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> {name, sides, ...restObj} = shape;
<span>console</span>.log(name, sides);
<span>console</span>.log(restObj);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932176160/97vWj-QQl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.b.png"></p>

<h2 id="12-swap-variables">12. Swap variables</h2>
<p>This must be super easy now using the concept of <code>destructuring</code> we learned just now.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> fire = <span>'🔥'</span>;
<span>let</span> fruit = <span>'🍉'</span>;

[fruit, fire] = [fire, fruit];
<span>console</span>.log(fire, fruit);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="13-isarray">13. isArray</h2>
<p>Another useful method for determining if an input is an Array or not.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(emojis));

<span>let</span> obj = {};
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(obj));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="14-undefined-vs-null">14. undefined vs null</h2>
<p><code>undefined</code> is where a value is not defined for a variable but, the variable has been declared. </p>
<p><code>null</code> itself is an empty and non-existent value which must be assigned to a variable explicitly.</p>
<p><code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are not strictly equal,</p>
<pre><code><span>undefined</span> === <span>null</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Read more about this topic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript">from here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="15-get-query-params">15. Get Query Params</h2>
<p><code>window.location</code> object has bunch of utility methods and properties. We can get information about protocol, host, port, domain etc from the browser urls using these properties and methods. </p>
<p>One of the properties that I found very useful is,</p>
<pre><code><span>window</span>.location.search
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>search</code> property returns the query string from the location url. Here is an example url: <code>https://tapasadhiary.com?project=js</code>. The <code>location.search</code> will return, <code>?project=js</code></p>
<p>We can use another useful interface called, <code>URLSearchParams</code> along with <code>location.search</code> to get the value of the query parameters.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> project = <span>new</span> URLSearchParams(location.search).get(<span>'project'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:
<code>js</code></p>

<div><p>A common perception of artificial intelligence is often different from real life. One imagines an intelligent robot which is making its own decisions, finds problems, and eventually takes over the humans. In reality, AI may be practically invisible in a software system. However, it does make a huge difference.</p></div>
<p>Imagine you are a realtor spending your typical workday at the office. You get overloaded with chunks of data about your clients. So once a new customer turns to you, you show him a generic company presentation and promise to call back once a matching property appears.</p>

<p><br>Thankfully, those days are gone.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using AI-based software, you can dramatically transform the way you serve the same customer. By putting in dozens of search criteria, you get instant results about available houses in real-time. Furthermore, you can offer personalized listings before the customer even turns to you. Learning about life events such as customer marriage, you can send the automated message sequence. You donâ€™t need to spend hours on manual research and analysis since AI will do the job for you.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us compare the brightest ideas of AI real estate apps and how they <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/top-11-emerging-tech-trends-in-real-estate/" target="_blank">simplify the real estate business</a>.</p>

<h2>Top AI real estate apps &amp; startups to learn from</h2>
<h2><strong>1. TRIRIGA</strong></h2>
<div><p>Launched by IBM, the TRIRIGA application uses AI in real estate to efficiently manage office space. The system learns how people are actually using space, collecting this data from various sources such as Wi-Fi and connected sensors. Then this info is presented in an easy-to-digest format. </p></div>
<p>The goal of the application is to manage workspaces wisely and cut on room wastage. This practice, in turn, can lead to significant cost savings for organizations. 30 to 40% of workspaces are currently underused according to the JLL report. In terms of cost-efficiency, this can result in thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>A smart AI assistant can then anticipate staff needs and reorganize building layouts accordingly. The cherry on top, you can engage with the system by only using your voice.</p>

<p>This is the case when artificial intelligence actually looks like robots. Doxel startup serves teams and projects still under construction. Autonomous machines track installed items and automatically measure the earned value for each item. You can see the construction site in 3D, view an updated progress report, and see the completion stats.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most important, you can instantly see the installation errors thanks to the AI engine. The system claims to save around 11% of overall budgets and grow team productivity by 38%.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>Houzen is a must-have tool for homeowners who need to find the agent fast. It filters realtors by success rates, local expertise, and accreditations, selecting them within 24 hours. This tool is quite simple to use &amp; efficient, speeding up the whole workflow. Analyzing the user's will to pay the application closes every deal much faster than traditional methods.Â&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<h2><strong>4. Compass</strong></h2>

<p><strong><em>A global mission: to help everyone find their perfect home</em></strong></p>
<div><p>More than 14 000 realtors across 100 US cities are using this application to find and sell houses. Meanwhile, the app story with artificial algorithms is quite curious. The great AI transition happened in 2019 when the company hired 200+ engineers and AI professionals to power up the solution. Now the AI team counts 320+ people in New York, Washington, and Seattle. The AI engine works in several different ways.</p><p>First, it offers personalized recommendations to every user based on its previous searches and interests. Second, a CRM-integrated AI shows realtors once a customer was particularly active on their platform, or other house search websites. Thus, it keeps realtors informed about customer behavior.</p></div>
<p><em>â€œ The process of buying or selling a home is often thought of as daunting and difficult, and Compass is changing that, Robert Reffkin, CEO at Compass</em></p>
<h2><strong>5. Localize.city</strong></h2>

    </figure>


                    
    
<div><p>A common thing people expect about a future apartment is sufficient sunlight in each room. However, the only way to check it is by visiting a place, isnâ€™t it? Localize.city proves to be an excellent alternative method by analyzing how much light each apartment receives during the year. More so, it analyses the sunniest hours during the day and the amount of time when sunlight penetrates the room.</p><p>The startup created a list of 10 darkest buildings in each district. Sunlight also affects the price of the apartment, as homeowners value natural light incredibly high. Therefore, once a user indicates their preferences, they get the info about park proximity, broken items, and even previous tenant complaints. We believe it is a sound example of how to use AI in commercial real estate to get unique data.</p></div>
<h2><strong>6. Rex</strong></h2>


                </div>

<div><p><strong><em>Mission: take the stress and confusion out of buying and selling houses</em></strong></p><p>Unlike many real estate agencies, this one does not use MLS (Multiple Property Listings). And it charges only 2% from realtors and homebuyers instead of typical 5 or 6%. Moreover, it pays the agent salaries, instead of working with them as contractors.Â&nbsp;</p></div>
<p><em>So how does it use AI?<br></em><strong><br></strong>To replace agents. The company tracks users who clicked the ads and their behavior on the website. Then, it shows the ads according to their interests. Smart algorithms also analyze the data about homeowner history to find out their buying capabilities. Computers are better at processing big loads of data, but REX still hires 22 people to guide users through the sales process. <strong><br></strong></p>
<h2><strong>7. Redfin</strong></h2>

    </figure>


                    
    
<div><p>Unlike the previous one, this tool uses AI in real estate to help realtors in their jobs, not replace them. It simplifies customer search and requires only a 1% commission for each sale. Artificial intelligence Matchmaking Tool analyzes data to recommend a home to potential buyers. Users are 4 times more likely to click on RedFin recommendation than on the one fitting their own saved search.</p><p>Besides, the company also uses AI to calculate the house value and advise home sellers on their marketing.</p></div>
<h2><strong>8. Apartment Ocean</strong></h2>
<div><p>Apartment Ocean helps realtors to convert potential customers and cut on acquisition expenses. It is the artificial intelligence chatbot that serves as a communication tool on a website. </p><p>The problem with first-time contacts is that most of them do not turn to sales. However, thanks to this convenient application, you can generate instant replies without spending effort &amp; time on this. The AI real estate application answers even the trickiest questions, sounding like a human. Besides, it is easy to customize and install on your website, a perfect solution for busy realtors.</p></div>

    </figure>


                    
    
<div><p>One of the logical applications of AI in real estate is price estimation. HouseCanary does just that, evaluating the house price at the current moment and in the nearest future. The AI software program analyses data during the past 40 years and generates forecasts with a 2.5 margin error, which is dramatically low. </p><p>Thanks to this data, you can anticipate the upcoming peaks or valleys, and allow for wise buying decisions. Lending organizations, financial, and real estate agencies use this software to build trust with their customers and convert them.</p><p>HouseCanary's success story proves that cost estimations &amp; predictive analytics are in high demand in the real estate market. It received $64 million of funding in total.</p></div>


                    
    
<h2><strong>10. GeoPhy</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img src="https://www.byteant.com/media/rj2lhlw2/geophy_ai.png?width=730&amp;height=456&amp;mode=max" alt="AI real estate app GeoPhy" width="730" height="456" data-udi="umb://media/aea3798c0adc43ceae00c616c2dd5498"></strong></p>

<p>A few days ago I finished a CAD application whose purpose is to calculate the energy efficiency of Dwellings (or multiple Dwellings). It can be seen as an application similar to Autocad (which is used in Civil Engineering, Architecture, etc) but with the specific purpose to do energy efficiency assessment.</p>



<p>After about 1 year of development, me and my client (he himself an energy rater) were able to finish the project within a much smaller time frame and a much smaller budget than other similar projects from competing companies. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that its cost was about 30 times less and it took at least less than half the time.</p>



<p>The feedback and reception to our application has gone much beyond what we expected even though the application is still in Beta.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>My responsibility in this project was to define the higher level architecture, do the implementation, User Interface Design and User Experience and all the aspects of setting up a professional environment and workflow for developing a software application.</p>



<p>My client, Nick, an energy rater by profession, has always been pushing energy rating to a higher level. He’s done the energy ratings for several buildings including commercial, public and residential. Some of them award winning projects. As a self-taught, amateur programmer he also helped implement the application. </p>



<p>The purpose of the tool, called HERO, is to do the energy efficiency assessment of buildings and in the end generate an energy rating certificate. These certificates are mandatory and every building must meet a minimum value of energy efficiency. Applications that have this purpose must be certified by a public entity (ours already is) and the professional doing the energy rating must himself be a certified energy rater (having completed an accredited course with success).</p>

<p>If you follow my blog, you’ve probably noticed from the picture that the application is using <a href="https://www.pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JMetro</a>. </p>



<p>The picture above is from the Model view. In this view you create the project and enter all its data. The pane to the left is where you can view  the visuals, and create the floor plan (visually). The pane to the right is the Datagrid where you see and enter data for all the objects of the project (walls, windows, floors, top lights, etc) in a table like format. All these views are inside a Dockpane like container that allows you to resize, restore and maximize each pane. </p>



<p>There are also other views, inside the Model view, not shown in the picture. Like the library where you can create and manage the materials that you can use throughout your project, your custom assemblies for walls, the different types of windows, etc.. </p>

<figcaption>Results View</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>After you run the simulation, you can also see the results of your energy efficiency modelling (picture above). The Results View shows a dashboard, with charts, tables, etc, that lets the user view at a glance how efficient the dwelling or dwellings are and quickly notice what might need to be readjusted.</p>



<h2>Details and a few features</h2>



<p>The calculations for the energy rating can get really complex. They can depend on a multitude of factors. To name a few:</p>



<ol><li>The materials used. There’s a huge database of materials that can be used in Floors, Ceilings, Walls, etc. And the user can also, for instance, create his own custom assembly for Walls defining their list of materials in a specified order (from inside to the outside).</li><li>Size and layout of the building’s areas.</li><li>Climate over the year in the area where the building is located.</li><li>Orientation of the building (influences how the Sun heats up each area).</li><li>Shading of other buildings, fences, etc that are around the building;</li><li>The building’s penetrations.</li><li>Top lights used, ceiling fans, exhaust fans, etc.</li><li>Other factors.</li></ol>



<p>All the items mentioned are modeled and calculated in HERO.</p>



<p>All the geometry, intersections, etc are also computed by the application. For instance, if you create a Zone in a level – a Zone can be a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc – and then another smaller Zone in the level above, there will be an intersection. This intersection will produce a “hole” in the ceiling of the level below, like a donut.  Hero will realize automatically that the 2 zones are connected and will create a new Ceiling in the zone below (in the place of the donut) adjacent to the zone above.</p>

<p>Another thing that HERO automatically computes are adjacencies between Walls and Zones. If you create a Zone right next to another, instead of creating 2 Walls between the Zones, the application will automatically figure out that the Zones are connected. It will connect the 2 zones by creating 1 internal Wall between them, which is different from an outside facing Wall.</p>

<p>For this post not to get too long, too tedious, and too technical I just pointed out some of the features of Hero, there are a lot more. I think you can get a general idea of Hero’s features from what was mentioned above. </p>



<h3>Reception and feedback</h3>



<p>Me and my client were surprised with the reception the application is getting. Given the application is still in Beta and that there are already 3 applications in the market, 2 of them well established, we were expecting a much more moderate reaction.</p>



<p>Before 24 hours had passed since the release, we had already 50 registered users and 1 certificate issued. In our issue tracker, which has the purpose of only storing bug reports from our users, we were getting thanks messages.</p>

<h3>Technology and form factor</h3>



<p><em><span>Notice: I might be a bit biased because I’ve been working with JavaFX (and Java) since the very first release. However, I’m going to be as impartial as possible.</span></em></p>



<p>If the requirements are to build a productivity application, the best option in my opinion is to go desktop native, instead of, for instance, doing a mobile app. Nothing beats a keyboard and a mouse in this area. Besides more precise and faster input, you can display much more content on screen without having to worry about the touch targets being too small for the fingers. This also means the user will be able to see more data on screen which will be important in a productivity application. </p>



<p>As for “native” vs web. Native allows for better performance, security, etc than a web application. Web has the advantage of higher availability (no required installations, all the user needs is a browser) but if you’re building a performance demanding app, I think your best bet is to go native.</p>



<p>Regarding the programming model, I tend to prefer Java (or any other object orientated, type safe language) and its framework and big collection of third party libraries than the web programming model. Especially when building complex applications.</p>



<p>JavaFX (and Java) are a perfect fit in this type of scenario as JavaFX really shines in the Desktop world. HERO is currently running on Windows, which will probably be the majority of users for your desktop applications. But we can easily, with a few tweaks, support Mac as well and even Linux (though in our case there probably won’t be many users using that O.S., if any).</p>



<p>If, for some reason, we ever have a need to create a scaled-down mobile or tablet version or reuse some of our existing components in a mobile application, we can. Oracle and Gluon have been pushing hard for this, continuously working and making it better. Recently, by leveraging GraalVM, applications can be AOT compiled, benefiting from faster startup times and performance. This is also great for IOS, since IOS doesn’t allow for JIT compilation. </p>



<p>To be fair and to try to be impartial, I’ll conclude this section with what, in my view, are some of downsides of JavaFX (currently):</p>



<ul><li>Table API.</li><li>Lack of tools to better debug CSS issues and try out CSS tweaks, like for instance having something like firebug (ScenicView is great for other purposes but not specifically for this one).</li><li>Lack of support for some of the Web’s CSS properties. Also one of my pet peeves is the fact that every property is prefixed with “-fx-” (I would prefer this would be dropped on properties that have the same behavior as the ones in Web CSS).</li><li>IDE support for JavaFX CSS isn’t great: error highlighting, etc (side note: I’m using Intellij).</li><li>JavaFX API is too closed and lacks better support for extension on some cases (classes that are final, classes with final methods, etc) regarding this issue I preferred Swing’s more open API.</li><li>Some Font rendering issues (this might only happen with some fonts and only on some platforms – Windows is worse than Mac).</li><li>Better separation of concerns in JavaFX Controls. There was a plan a few years ago to make Behavior classes public, which would probably provide a better separation between the View, Controller and Model aspects of a Control. Right now it’s a bit difficult to create a new Skin for an existing JavaFX SDK Control if your only requirement is to tweak some of its View aspects and when that can’t be done through CSS. This often results in developers preferring to create a new Control altogether than providing a new Skin for an existing one which will mean more work and a higher degree of coupling with those Controls (for instance, you won’t be able to easily switch between Skins). The fact that the API is often too closed also means that, usually, extending an existing Control isn’t an option.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Despite being a quite complex application, I believe HERO was created in a record time. Not …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>When we first</strong> <strong>conceived of Density six years ago</strong>, we just wanted to know if there was a line at our favorite coffee shop. We thought it was odd there was an API for inclement weather but there wasn't an API for how many people were in a space. We reasoned, if a solution didn't already exist â€” which surely it must â€” it shouldn't be more than a weekend project. How hard could it be to count people?</p>



<p>We were optimistic and wrong by about three years. As we tried to solve our own problem, we learned two important lessons. First, people are weird. They do things you wouldn't expect â€” they bump into each other, take phone calls, and they bring a lot of stuff with them: bags and boxes, bicycles and baskets, tv's and trash cans, chairs, carts, iPads, lunch, even other people sometimes. This makes counting them unfathomably complex. You can't fault commodity products for being bad at the analysis. People are just really weird.</p>



<p>Second, we learned we weren't alone. We met hundreds and now thousands of others trying to answer the same question â€” how many people used my office, bank, lounge, desk, space, floor, building, campusâ€¦ city. If only we knew, we could reduce waste and energy use, improve access and productivity, clean the spaces that need it and skip the ones that don't. If only we knew, we could A/B test physical space or even use less concrete! If only we knew how the world was used, we could measure how it works, identify its inefficiencies, and remake it.</p>



<p>Until recently, we had been helping hundreds of companies do just this â€” quantify how buildings were used so they could design them more effectively. Today, things have changed. We've been asked to help those same companies and hundreds more reopen their buildings and businesses safely. We're helping them avoid leases they don't need in order to prioritize payroll. We're working to keep meat processing plants, distribution centers, manufacturers, offices, universities, even an entire village in Ohio open and safe.</p>



<p>The built world was modernizing before the pandemic. It will continue to modernize well after it's over. In the meantime, we're proud to say we're not going anywhere and we're eager to help.</p>

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128.jpeg 1800w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1024x732.jpeg 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-768x549.jpeg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laptop-on-table-rotated-e1595655657128-1536x1097.jpeg 1536w"></a></p>
<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" alt="" width="533" height="142" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Digital microwaves show an example of good UI doing what you wanted</h2>

	<p><small>July 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often, you encounter a bit of UI that does what you mean
to do so transparently that you don't even notice that the UI is
breaking its own 'how it works' rules to do so. You could say that
this is the complete reverse of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixAnnoyance">robot logic</a>,
as seen yesterday in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/PamPasswdErrorFail">trying to change your password on Linux</a>. Recently I realized that I'd run
into such a 'do what I mean even though it doesn't fit' UI in plain
ordinary microwaves, of all places.</p>

<p>Your typical microwave has a 0-9 digital pad for entering the cooking
time and its cook time is set in MM:SS. If you want one minute and
twenty seconds, you punch in '1 2 0' and the microwave displays '1:20'
and counts down from there. This is all perfectly logical and sensible,
and forms a clear model of how the microwave behaves.</p>

<p>So what happens if you enter '9 0'? The microwave doesn't reject
this as an error because you can't have 90 seconds in the seconds
portion of a minutes and seconds time (you can have at most 59).
Instead it breaks the model and gives you 90 seconds of cook time.
This creates some inconsistencies, of course; if you enter '9 9'
you get 99 seconds, but if you enter '1 0 0', you get 60 seconds
(because now it's 1:00 cook time). On at least some microwaves
this still works even if you enter more than two digits; '1 9 9'
is 199 seconds, not an error (or one minute plus 99 seconds).</p>

<p>This behavior was so natural and so obviously correct and what I meant
that I spent years not realizing there was anything unusual about
it. Only one day as I was keying in '9 0' yet again and congratulating
myself on pressing one less digit than '1 3 0' did I stop to ask myself
why it even worked. And the answer is that the microwave makers went out
of their way to figure out what this input should mean so that it should
match user expectations, and make it so.</p>

<p>(I suspect or at least hope that there were user studies by some early
microwave company on what people expected to happen when they keyed in
various number sequences that weren't proper MM:SS setups.)</p>

  <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>When running a production Kubernetes cluster, one of the most important (and burdensome) tasks is keeping everything up-to-date. Kubernetes itself cuts quarterly releases, which quickly fall out of support—if you fail to upgrade, you could be left open to security holes and buggy features. Fortunately, the quarterly cadence at least makes these releases predictable: you can even set a reminder to go through the process every three months.</p>

<p><span>Source: <a href="https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/</a></span></p>
<p>But on top of Kubernetes, you probably have half a dozen add-ons running in your cluster, most likely installed&nbsp;<a href="https://helm.sh/"> <span>via Helm</span></a>. Supplementary components like nginx-ingress, cert-manager and linkerd are often critical to running a production-grade cluster. You might even be using k8s-specific deployments for common applications like PostgreSQL or Wordpress. Each of these tools has its own release cadence, and some updates may come with critical security patches.</p>
<p>Installing a new patch typically isn’t that hard - usually it just means rerunning a <span><code>helm install,</code></span>&nbsp;command, or updating a single line in your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/why-infrastructure-as-code-kubernetes"> <span>Infrastructure-as-Code</span></a> repository. But how do you know <em>when</em> it’s time to update? Unlike Kubernetes itself, Helm chart updates are incredibly hard to monitor and predict.</p>
<h2><strong>Observe and Report</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=480&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png" alt="Nova_bfw_color" width="480" srcset="https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=240&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 240w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=480&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 480w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=720&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 720w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=960&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 960w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=1200&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 1200w, https://www.fairwinds.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nova_bfw_color.png?width=1440&amp;name=Nova_bfw_color.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/Nova/"><span>Nova</span></a>, an open source tool by Fairwinds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. <a href="https://ctt.ac/8q0Af" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click to Tweet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. Nova will let you know if you’re running a chart that’s out-of-date or deprecated, so you can make sure you’re always aware of updates.</p>
<pre><code>Release Name      Installed    Latest     Old     Deprecated
cert-manager      v0.11.0      v0.15.2    true    false
insights-agent    0.21.1       0.21.1     false   false
grafana           2.1.3        3.1.1      true    false
metrics-server    2.8.8        2.11.1     true    false
nginx-ingress     1.25.0       1.40.3     true    false
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to see how far behind you are on any installed Helm charts. In the example above, we’ve got the latest version of <span><code>insights-agent,</code></span>but there are minor updates available for some core infrastructure, including <span><code>cert-manager,</code><code>nginx-ingress,</code></span>and <span><code>metrics-server.</code></span><span><span><code>grafana</code></span></span>also has a new major version available, so we might be missing out on some cool new features!</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>This turned out to be a harder problem than expected.</p>
<p>The first issue was in supporting both Helm 2 and Helm 3. Helm 2 stored chart metadata using ConfigMaps, which were fairly easy to parse. But Helm 3 uses Secrets, along with some byzantine encoding practices. With some help from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/kubernetes-easily-find-deprecated-api-versions-with-pluto"> <span>the Pluto team</span></a>, we built support for both versions, as well as the ability to auto-detect charts from both versions. You can use this feature by specifying <span><code>--helm-version=auto.</code></span></p>
<p>Even more challenging was matching the installed chart to the upstream source. Unfortunately, Helm doesn’t store info about the upstream repository in the chart metadata, making an exact match impossible. All we have to go on is the name, which might be duplicated across different repositories. For example, many of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/"> <span>the Bitnami charts</span></a> were recently migrated out of the<a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/"> <span>core charts repo</span></a>, but kept the same names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find a match, we have to look in <em>all</em> known repositories for charts with a matching name, then use heuristics like the chart’s <span><code>version, home, description,</code></span> and <span><code>maintainers</code></span> to find a good match. So far this strategy has a 100% success rate, but it feels like a bit of a hack. If you know of a better solution for finding the upstream repository for an installed Helm chart, let us know!</p>
<h2><strong>Putting it into Practice</strong></h2>
<p>Nova saves a lot of time and effort for anyone looking to keep their charts up-to-date. Instead of having to monitor each individual chart for updates, operators can now run a single CLI to detect old versions running in their cluster. But you still have to remember to run the CLI!</p>
<p>When managing hundreds of clusters, the chances of forgetting to run Nova on a particular cluster, misreading the output, or failing to act on the results, are all but certain at scale. Furthermore, some organizations <em>need</em> to be on an older version of a given tool (in particular, <span><code>cert-manager</code></span> has regularly introduced breaking changes). So we needed a way to operationalize Nova at scale.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights"> <span>Fairwinds Insights</span></a>. Insights can run Nova (along with other Kubernetes auditing tools) automatically on a regular schedule—every hour by default—and use the results to create&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/action-items/"> <span>Action Items</span></a>. These Action Items serve as a reminder to update your Helm Chart, and can be piped to Slack, Datadog, or anywhere else your engineers live.</p>
<p>Internally, we also maintain a YAML file that includes a set of standards - particular versions of each add-on that we expect our clients to run. We use Nova to make sure that YAML file stays up-to-date with the latest versions, and to keep our Infrastructure-as-Code in line with those standards.</p>

<p>Automatically checking Helm charts for updates solves a big problem for us at Fairwinds, and for the Kubernetes community as a whole. But the ecosystem moves fast, and there are many more pieces of software and infrastructure that we need to stay on top of. Other things we’d like to build automated checks for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported k8s versions on managed Kubernetes providers (like GKE, EKS, and AKS)</li>
<li>Docker tags (at least where semver tagging practices are used)</li>
<li>Docker base images</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether these checks fit into Nova, or will justify creating a separate project, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any domain, staying on top of the latest releases is a big, scary problem. We hope Nova helps the Kubernetes community keep their clusters reliable and secure.</p>

But as more and more topics become too risky to discuss outside of the prevailing orthodoxies, it makes sense to constantly self-censor, feeling unbound only when part of a denunciatory pack. </p><p>Institutions that are supposed to be guardians of free expression—academia and journalism in particular—are becoming enforcers of conformity. Campuses have bureaucracies that routinely undermine free speech and due process. Now, these practices are breaching the ivy wall. They are coming to a high school or corporate HR office near you.</p><p>The cultural rules around hot button issues are ever-expanding. It’s as if a daily script went out describing what’s acceptable, and those who flub a line—or don’t even know a script exists—are rarely given the benefit of the doubt, no matter how benign their intent. Naturally, people are deciding the best course is to shut up. It makes sense to be part of the silenced majority when the price you pay for an errant tweet or remark can be the end of your livelihood. </p><p>Do these problems really matter so long as we have a president who daily tramples on rights, civil discourse, and the rule of law? They do. Of course, we must keep our focus on the danger this administration presents. But it is also our moral and strategic obligation to vigorously defend the principles of a free society. Upholding these values will help us defeat Trumpism. </p><p>The process by which sinners are punished and apostates expelled can seem random. But there are rules and patterns to the ways in which speech is being silenced. Analyzing and understanding these can help us stand up to the illiberalism of this moment, whether it comes from the left or the right. </p><p>To that end, here is my taxonomy of fear. </p><p><strong>The Perils of Safety </strong></p><p>James Bennet’s resignation from his position as the editorial page editor of the <em>New York Times</em> quickly became the genesis story of today’s debate about “cancel culture.” Bennet was pressured to depart after he ran an op-ed by Tom Cotton, a Republican Senator from Arkansas, whose argument that the military should be used to respond to riots caused an uproar among the paper’s staff.</p><p>At first, A. G. Sulzberger, the paper’s publisher, publicly expressed his support for the decision to run the op-ed. But that quickly changed after Black employees asserted not just that Cotton’s argument was morally repugnant, or that he failed to make it in a way that met the <em>Times</em>’ standards, but that the piece threatened their lives. “Running this puts Black @nytimes staff in danger,” many of them tweeted.</p><p>The language used by the <em>Times </em>staffers is indicative of a wider trend. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>,</em> Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt describe the recent emergence and rapid spread on college campuses of what they call “safetyism,” a view that “equates emotional discomfort with physical danger.” Safetyism, they write, teaches students “to see words as violence and interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous.”</p><p>Confronted with words, ideas, or decisions they dislike, a growing number of people are asserting that they are in danger of suffering psychological or even bodily harm. But when one party asserts that a debate threatens their very well-being, it is hard to deliberate on policy—or topics such as race and gender. The result is a narrowing of the space for public discussion and an inability to teach ever more ideas and books. </p><p>As Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen has chronicled in the <em>New Yorker</em>, for example, law professors find it increasingly difficult to teach rape law because some students consider the subject too disturbing. “Student organizations representing women’s interests now routinely advise students that they should not feel pressured to attend or participate in class sessions that focus on the law of sexual violence, and which might therefore be traumatic,” she writes. “Some students have even suggested that rape law should not be taught because of its potential to cause distress.” </p><p>But, as Suk Gersen has pointed out, it was feminists who fought for the overhaul of deeply sexist rape laws, and it is sexual assault victims who will be hurt if lawyers do not learn about the subject. In practice, safetyism will make some of the most vulnerable people in our society less safe.</p><p><strong>Contamination by Association</strong></p><p>Recently, more than 150 writers and academics (including Yascha Mounk and I) signed a public letter defending open debate. Shortly after, transgender writer Emily VanDerWerff shared on Twitter a note of <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyvdw/status/1280580388495097856">complaint</a> she had written to her editors, stating that the letter had rendered her “less safe at <em>Vox</em>” because Matt Yglesias, one of <em>Vox’s</em> co-founders, was among its signatories.</p><p>How could signing a letter decrying the intolerant atmosphere on the left render a colleague less safe? Because, VanDerWerff argues, the letter was also signed by people she characterized as “prominent anti-trans voices.” Though the letter itself made no mention of trans issues, and VanDerWerff has never accused Yglesias himself of expressing objectionable views on the subject, this, she claims, was enough to harm her.</p><p>VanDerWerff’s note certainly illustrates safetyism. Going one step further, it also assumes the truth of a principle of “contamination by association.” People, the logic goes, cannot only be made unsafe by the beliefs or statements of their colleagues but also by those with whom their colleagues associate. </p><p>In this view, the contamination is ruthless and insidious. As VanDerWerff asserts, not only is Yglesias now responsible for the views of all the signers of the letter; she is also concerned that readers and sources may now assume that <em>she herself </em>shares those views because she works with Yglesias. If the principle of “contamination by association” were to be adopted this broadly, people would soon be answerable for the work of the co-signatories on a letter, for those with whom they have appeared on a panel, for those they might talk to on a podcast, and for countless others with whom they share the most tenuous of professional connections. </p><p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/">Shadi Hamid</a> is a Muslim scholar of Islamist movements; to do his work, he needs to talk to people who hold ideas many find objectionable. His willingness to engage with people he disagrees with often makes him the subject of fierce criticism about whom he “associates” with. He lucidly explains why the adoption of the idea that he shares responsibility for the views of others is so detrimental: “My policy is to speak with pretty much anyone—Islamists, Christian theocrats, Trumpists, Salafis—as long as I can say what I think on something that’s important to me.” </p><p>Even for Hamid, there are some red lines: He will not appear alongside white supremacists or those representing designated terror groups. But he insists that it is important to draw those lines as widely as possible: “If we said we couldn’t do research or couldn’t interview people who had bad views—how would we study things?” Hamid asked me. “It’s a very limited way of looking at the world, one that’s dangerous for democracy.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hamid is right. If we accept the logic of contamination by association, this requirement will quickly come to suppress the exchange of ideas—or even exposure to ideas which we need to interrogate precisely because we hate them. Tackling views we disagree with is a basic obligation of journalism, especially when they are held by people with the power to put them into effect.</p><p>David Remnick, the editor of the<em> New Yorker</em>, gave eloquent voice to the necessity of such interrogation when he explained why he wanted to interview former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon at the <em>New Yorker</em> festival in 2018. Remnick acknowledged the point of view of those who assert that it is better not to give a platform to someone with illiberal views. “But to interview Bannon is not to endorse him,” Remnick wrote. “The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned.” </p><p>But Remnick was not able to put this pressure on Bannon because the pressure on Remnick to rescind Bannon’s invitation was so great that he canceled the interview. </p><p>To accept the principles of contamination by association would also have another, perhaps even more serious cost: It would make it much more difficult to build a community across ideological divides—or within one’s own ideological group. Today, people are held to account for everything they have said or written, no matter how long ago, and no matter how much their minds may have changed. But under the rules of contamination, any affiliation with anyone else means everything <em>they </em>have said and done is your responsibility, too. Under such circumstances, any rational person is going to think of everyone else, first and foremost, as a potential human landmine; better, then, to draw the circle of one’s friends, colleagues, and collaborators as narrowly as possible.</p><p><strong>Intent Is Irrelevant</strong></p><p>Last month, Libby Schaaf, the white mayor of Oakland, California, announced that ropes had been found hanging from trees around a local lake. “These incidents will be investigated as a hate crime,” she said at a press conference. “I want to be clear, regardless of the intentions of whoever put those nooses in our public trees, in our sacred public space here in Oakland, intentions don’t matter.”</p><p>An investigation revealed that the five ropes had nothing to do with lynching: They were homemade exercise equipment, used by adults and children, put up months earlier by a black resident, Victor Sengbe. He explained his intent at a press conference: “It was really a fun addition to the park.” </p><p>But this happy conclusion was of no interest to Schaaf. The actual purpose of the ropes did not “remove nor excuse their …</p></div></div>

		<div>
			<p>Global variables are almost universally discouraged in software development — and for good reason. Storing data in a context is often discouraged as well — and again for good reason. However, global variables and context values can be combined to produce something that preserves the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of each.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-global-variables">The Problem With Global Variables</h2>
<p>One of the earliest rules a software developer learns is to avoid global variables. But global values do exist. Most applications have at least several variables that could be considered globals such as a database connection pool, a logger, or an application configuration object. Technically, they may or may not actually be global variables. The developer may scrupulously follow “best practices” and instead pass the value as an argument or capture it in a closure. But practically speaking, they are global values. There is only one application configuration object.</p>
<p>The big problem with a global variable is the “variable” not the “global”. The downside of a global immutable value is small. But usually values like an application configuration object are initialized on program startup and do not change afterwards.</p>
<p>But the “global” part can cause problems as well. For example, when the actual application is running it makes sense for there to be one global configuration object. But global variables make it much more difficult to write tests. Another example would be a logger that is used almost everywhere, but on occasion should be overridden.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-context-values">The Problem With Context Values</h2>
<p>Context values have multiple issues as well. Type safety is lost because they are stored and retrieved as <code>interface{}</code>. In addition, functions that rely on context values being present essentially have hidden required arguments. Lastly, there is a performance penalty for a context with many values.</p>
<h2 id="the-context-overridable-global-pattern">The Context Overridable Global Pattern</h2>
<p>The context overridable global pattern restricts access to globals to getter functions. These functions accept a context as an argument. If the context has a value for that global then the context value is returned. If not the global is returned. For example, the sample below has an context overridable global of <code>AppName</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"context"</span>
	<span>"ctxglobexample/app"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	app.<span>SetAppName</span>(<span>"Global Value"</span>)

	<span>// The background context will use the global value.
</span><span></span>	fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Background context:"</span>, app.<span>AppName</span>(context.<span>Background</span>()))

	<span>// A context can override the global value.
</span><span></span>	ctx <span>:=</span> app.<span>WithAppName</span>(context.<span>Background</span>(), <span>"Context Value"</span>)
	fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"WithAppName context:"</span>, app.<span>AppName</span>(ctx))

	<span>// The global value is unchanged.
</span><span></span>	fmt.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Background context:"</span>, app.<span>AppName</span>(context.<span>Background</span>()))
}
</code></pre></div><p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">Background context: Global Value
WithAppName context: Context Value
Background context: Global Value
</code></pre></div><p>And here is the implementation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> app

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"context"</span>
)

<span>// Use internal types and values as context keys to enforce access only through exposed functions.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> ctxKey <span>int</span>

<span>const</span> (
	_ ctxKey = <span>iota</span>
	appNameCtxKey
)

<span>var</span> appName <span>string</span>

<span>func</span> <span>SetAppName</span>(s <span>string</span>) {
	<span>if</span> appName <span>!=</span> <span>""</span> {
		<span>panic</span>(<span>"cannot call appName twice"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> s <span>==</span> <span>""</span> {
		<span>panic</span>(<span>"AppName must not be empty"</span>)
	}
	appName = s
}

<span>func</span> <span>AppName</span>(ctx context.Context) <span>string</span> {
	v <span>:=</span> ctx.<span>Value</span>(appNameCtxKey)
	<span>if</span> v <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> v.(<span>string</span>)
	}

	<span>if</span> appName <span>==</span> <span>""</span> {
		<span>panic</span>(<span>"missing AppName in ctx and global"</span>)
	}

	<span>return</span> appName
}

<span>func</span> <span>WithAppName</span>(ctx context.Context, s <span>string</span>) context.Context {
	<span>return</span> context.<span>WithValue</span>(ctx, appNameCtxKey, s)
}
</code></pre></div><p>This pattern solves the problems identified above with globals and contexts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global variables are mutable — global values can only be set once. If mutability was <em>really</em> desired, then the getter and setter functions can be safely altered to use a mutex.</li>
<li>Global variables are global — the context can be used to override the global whenever needed.</li>
<li>Context values lose type safety — access is restricted to getter and setter functions that are type safe.</li>
<li>Functions relying on context values have hidden required arguments — the global value is used if the context value is missing. The required argument is now an optional argument.</li>
<li>Performance penalty of many values on a context — the <em>almost</em> global values are rarely set on the context. They fall through to the global without ever using <code>context.WithValue()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron" id="" title="">GitHub repo</a>) is a note-taking tool based on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011401.html" id="" title="">Zettelkasten</a>, that aims to be <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html" id="" title="">future-proof</a>. Version <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/releases/tag/0.6.0.0" id="" title="">0.6</a> just got released; its major highlight is that neuron is now based on the <strong>Pandoc</strong> AST. This allows us to support any format supported by <a href="https://pandoc.org/" id="" title="">Pandoc</a>. Experimental <strong>org-mode</strong> support is <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/313" id="" title="">already in</a>, to begin with.</p><h2 id="better-markdown">Better Markdown</h2><p>Previous versions of neuron used the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmark" id="" title="">mmark</a> parser which advertises itself as being “strict”. This prevented certain links from working as they caused the parser to fail. In version 0.6, I switched over to use <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs" id="" title="">commonmark-hs</a>, which is the Haskell implementation of the <a href="https://commonmark.org/" id="" title=""><strong>CommonMark</strong> specification</a>, written by the same author of Pandoc. Another reason for switching is that commonmark-hs and its extensions can be compiled to JavaScript via GHCJS<sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, which is useful when reusing the Haskell code with the web app (see below).</p><p>The commonmark-hs parser includes <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/tree/master/commonmark-extensions" id="" title="">a bunch of nifty <strong>extensions</strong></a> that are all made available in neuron.</p><p>In addition, you can style your Markdown notes using supported Semantic UI classes (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/176" id="" title="">see here</a>), as well as use raw HTML if necessary.</p><h2 id="uplink-tree">Uplink Tree</h2><p>I find arbitrary graph views of Zettelkasten software to be rarely useful. Neuron on the other hand displays what is known as a “<a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/5e41fd32.html" id="" title="">uplink tree</a>” in each note view, which represents the <em>subset</em> (inasmuch as “uplink” is a type of “backlink”) of the backlink graph for that note. In Zettelkasten-speak, we talk of a note “branching” to another. The uplink tree displays all notes “branching” to the note being viewed.</p><p>Uplink Trees are similar to navigation panel or category tree, except that the heterarchy is built organically over time based on how the notes are linked (see <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2017401.html" id="" title="">Folgezettel Heterarchy</a>). In the screenshot below, you are viewing the uplink tree of the note titled “<span><span data-inverted="" data-position="right center" data-tooltip="Tags: nix; reflex/obelisk"><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017101.html">Type safe static assets</a></span></span>”. Notice how this note has multiple parents (that “branch of” to that note). See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011504.html" id="" title="">Linking</a> in the neuron manual.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/uplinktree.png" title=""></p><h2 id="vim">Vim</h2><p>In addition to <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/4a6b25f1.html" id="" title="">Emacs</a>, there is now a Vim extension for neuron. See <a href="https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim" id="" title="">neuron.vim</a> by ihsan. Just like the Emacs extension, it supports “virtual titles” in neovim, where the title of a linked note is displayed next to the link ID, as you can see from the screenshot below.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/neuronvim.png" title=""></p><h2 id="improved-cli-query">Improved CLI query</h2><p>The <code id="">neuron query</code> command can be used to query your Zettelkasten and get JSON output. <code id="">neuron query --id &lt;ID&gt;</code> gets you the metadata of a zettel note, whereas <code id="">neuron query --graph</code> gets the entire graph. For an example of what you can do with the later, check out <a href="https://github.com/b0o/neuron-extras" id="" title="">neuron-autoindex</a> by Maddison Hellstrom.</p><h2 id="error-reporting">Error reporting</h2><p>Neuron 0.6 includes resilient error handling. If there is an error in your notes, the command line tool will report them both in the console and the web interface, without breaking its workflow. This enables you to leave the daemon (<code id="">neuron rib -ws ..</code>) running on your server, as all errors are now reported on the generated site.</p><h2 id="docker-images">Docker images</h2><p>While Nix is still the recommended way to install, we now also have auto-created Docker images for neuron. With one <code id="">docker run ...</code> command, you can run the latest development version of <code id="">neuron</code> in a matter of seconds. The whole image is only about 100MB in size. See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/c6176636.html" id="" title="">Docker workflow</a> for details.</p><h2 id="automatic-publishing">Automatic Publishing</h2><p>You can now set up your neuron notes to publish <em>automatically</em> on the web for free. See <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron-template#readme" id="" title="">neuron-template</a> to get started. The gist of the idea is that we use GitHub Actions and Pages to update your published site as you change your notes in the Git repository. I publish every neuron site in this way. A <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/778816d3.html" id="" title="">GitLab workflow</a> also exists.</p><p>You can also of course alternatively choose to self-host your neuron site, say as a systemd service. See the <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6479cd5e.html" id="" title="">documentation on this</a>.</p><h2 id="web--mobile-app">Web &amp; mobile app</h2><p><a href="http://www.cerveau.app/" id="" title="">Cerveau</a> (in private beta) is the web application on top of neuron that integrates with GitHub. The idea is that you can have your cake and eat it too. A command-line based workflow to edit your notes in Git repo does not mean you can’t do the same in a web application or a mobile app. Cerveau aims to address this gap, with the motto being: future-proof notes with little to no compromise on delightful user experience.</p></div></div>]]>

<article>
<div>

<p><em>Time-Driven Development is a software development concept where the main focus is development time. Here's everything you should know about this approach and how you can make it work for your team. </em></p>


<p>Being a <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">software engineer</a> nowadays can be overwhelming: you need to keep up with the latest trends in software development, always follow “the best” software design practices, and make sure you earn the respect of your Twitter fellows.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A couple of years ago, Johannes Broadwall, fed up with the attitude everyone (including himself) had towards Clean Code, he went so far as to boycott clean code for the sake of compassionate code. </p>


<p>As he said, he was fed up with leaving the office later than his colleagues every day, to spend time “polishing some piece of ultimately meaningless code”.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On a similar note, a Stackoverflow user, who was desperately trying to make use of the <a href="https://adevait.com/software/solid-design-principles-the-guide-to-becoming-better-developers" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOLID design principles</a>, fragmented their code so much that they ended up asking for a way to refactor away from SRP.</p>


<p>When the best practice makes your life as a developer miserable instead of better, it’s not the best practice anymore, is it?</p>


<p>We desperately need a new way of defining the best practices in software development depending on the context of the project. That’s what Time-Driven Development is about: designing our code in a way that saves most time in the long run.</p>





<h2 id="what-is-time-driven-development">What is Time-Driven Development?</h2>


<p>Time-Driven Development is a slightly different software development concept where the main focus is development time. And this doesn’t mean that you should ship features fast without thinking about code quality. </p>


<p>Quite the opposite: before deciding on the design of your code you should think about how it should look like in the long run. </p>


<p>If it’s a feature that should be there years from now and needs to be extendable and maintainable, then go ahead and plan your code architecture in a way where you’ll spend more time now in order to save more going forward.</p>


<p>However, if you’re <a href="https://adevait.com/blog/startups/build-minimum-viable-product" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">building an MVP</a> or a single feature that’s not interconnected and you’re not sure how it will get developed going forward - spending time on the perfect architecture is a time that you could spend on creating more value for the user.</p>


<p>Let’s look at some examples.</p>


<h2 id="how-to-save-time-by-following-good-design-practices"><strong>How to Save Time by Following Good Design Practices?</strong></h2>


<p>Before we became a fully remote network of engineers and designers from all over the world, Adeva was a small agency with a team of 10. </p>


<p>When we first started working remotely and expanding to new countries, it was getting harder to manage things in the way we were used to. </p>


<p>So, we started working on building an infrastructure that will enable us to manage our global team and easily give companies access to the best talent everywhere.</p>


<p>We didn’t want to spend too much time or money initially on building this platform, so we took things lean. We were using Zoho CRM at the time, so we said ok, this will be the base for our platform. </p>


<p>Zoho’s infrastructure was our storage for all candidates' details and we created a nice interface on our side where people could log in and manage their profiles. </p>


<p>We heavily relied on Zoho’s API and looking to do things fast, we created a single class where we dumped all methods we needed to manipulate with Zoho’s data and pass them to our app. It looked something like this:</p>


<pre><code>class ZohoCandidate {
    public function getCandidates() {...}
    public function getCandidate(int $id) {...}
    ...
    public function getExperiences(int $candidateId) {...}
    ...
    public function getEducations(int $candidateId) {...}
    ...
}</code></pre>


<p>Then, in the CandidateController we simply get all details from the CRM class and we’re good to go.</p>


<pre><code>$zohoCandidate = new ZohoCandidate(env('ZOHO_AUTH_TOKEN'));
$candidate = $zohoCandidate-&gt;getCandidate($id);
$candidate = $zohoCandidate-&gt;getCandidate($id);
$educations = $zohoCandidate-&gt;getEducations($id);
$skills = explode(', ', $candidate['Main Skill']);
return view('profile', compact('candidate', 'experiences', 'educations', 'skills'));</code></pre>


<p>This all works fine, but it relies very heavily on the CRM, which can be a problem if you plan to move to your own database storage at one point and stop using the external CRM, like we did. If we follow the SOLID design principles, we’ll notice a few red flags:</p>


<ol><li><strong>The controller knows too much about the implementation of the CRM storage</strong>. It instantiates the class directly and uses its methods, which makes it hard to change the implementation in the future. If we need to change the storage to MySQL for instance, we’ll need to come back to this method and change the whole implementation. This makes the controller open for modification and very error-prone.</li><li><strong>Our app fully relies on the CRM’s storage and variable names, which makes it hard to change the implementation with local storage with different naming conventions</strong>. When we want to change the storage, we’ll need to go ahead and change the variable names throughout the code.</li></ol>


<p>Taking a diff view from Github, this is how changing the storage looked like:</p>


<figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-1024x343.png" alt="Git diff: not following SOLID design principles"></figure>


<p>And this would’ve been ok if it was just one file, but the same issue translates to all other methods for managing the candidates; all controllers handling related data, views, and unit tests. Changing the storage from the external CRM to a local database turned out to be quite a quest. Here are the things we had to do:</p>


<ol><li>Create classes for managing the local database storage (in our case, we’re using <a href="https://adevait.com/laravel" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laravel</a> so this meant creating Eloquent models to use with MySQL).</li><li>Change all dependencies from CRM class to Eloquent in all controllers throughout the app.&nbsp;</li><li>Use Eloquent instead of CRM to pull the data for presenting it to the users.</li><li>Switch all variables to the new naming convention defined by our local connection.&nbsp;</li><li>Change the way we access data in the views (use eloquent relationships and new naming conventions).</li><li>Adjust the unit tests to work accordingly.</li></ol>


<p>Considering all of this, the time we estimated we’ll need to switch the storage was 30 days. The question is: can we do something to <strong>save time</strong>? Turns out, we can. If we improve the code design to allow for extending and changing the implementation easily.</p>


<h3><strong>How to Design Your Code to Help You Save Time in the Long Run?</strong></h3>


<p>Designing your code in a way that will save you significant development time in the long run requires you to invest some extra time in the beginning to create a solid architecture that allows for easy extension and maintenance of your code. Here are some steps that we took which can help you achieve that.</p>


<h4>Don’t Depend on Concrete Implementations</h4>


<p>One of the ground rules of the SOLID design principles is to never depend on concrete implementations and depend on abstractions instead. This gives you the flexibility to change the implementation in the future without having to change the whole code. </p>


<p>In our example below, what we need to do to achieve this is to create an abstract class or an interface that will outline all methods we need to use from the CRM and have our CRM class adhere to that. Our controller would then depend on the abstract class instead of the concrete CRM implementation. </p>


<p>Here is how that looks like:</p>


<pre><code>public function edit($id, CandidateRepositoryInterface $candidateRepository) {
    $candidate = $candidateRepository-&gt;getCandidateById($id);
    $skills = explode(', ', $candidate-&gt;overview-&gt;main_skill);
    return view('profile', compact('candidate', 'skills'));
}</code></pre>


<h4>Be Mindful About What Your Program Expects</h4>


<p>To be able to replace one implementation in our codebase with another, it’s important to be aware of what our program expects. </p>


<p>In our case, we relied on the CRM’s methods and naming conventions so simply replacing the implementation with local storage would’ve broken our program immediately. </p>


<p>To avoid this, it’s a good idea to think about what your methods or variables should look like before starting the implementation. </p>


<p>That way you can easily change the implementation afterward without having to change all instances throughout the code. Let’s see what this means in our example.</p>


<p>First, we had to think about the way we’ll want to access the data when we change the storage to a local database. Since we were going to rely on Laravel’s models, we decided to create an adapter class to mock their behavior. </p>


<p>Now, instead of having one big CRM class, we had small classes for all of the data records the CRM returned, simulating the functionality of the Laravel models.</p>


<pre><code>class Candidate {
    ...
    public function overview() {...}
    public function education() {...}
    public function experience() {...}
}</code></pre>


<p>Then, we need to account for the variable names. So, the adapter class should adapt the variables the CRM returns into the format we need. With this, we can use the API in the same format we’ll need when we change to local storage.</p>


<pre><code>private function parse() {
    return [
        'CANDIDATEID' =&gt; 'id',
        'First Name' =&gt; 'first_name',
        'Last Name' =&gt; 'last_name',
        'Salutation' =&gt; 'salutation',
        'Email' =&gt; 'email',
    ];
}</code></pre>


<h4>Add New Code Instead of Changing the Existing One</h4>


<p>Having adjusted our code like this, we can now change the storage from the CRM to our local database without having to change all of the underlying code. </p>


<p>Instead what we need to do is add new classes that will cover the MySQL implementation and change the dependency from ZohoCrm to MySQL. Here is what we did to achieve this:</p>


<ol><li>Create a new repository <code>LocalCandidateRepository</code> that implements the interface we outlined for the Candidate methods.</li><li>Create new classes for each of the local tables we’ll use in the database once we move to our local storage.</li><li>Bind the&nbsp; LocalCandidateRepository with the CandidateRepositoryInterface, so every time we try to make an instance of CandidateRepositoryInterface it now uses the local repository instead of the CRM. In Laravel, this is done in the AppServiceProvider, with the following …</li></ol></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");
}</code></pre>
<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

However, after being funded, they started adding more features to appeal to the needs of broader markets (the VC model of funding) which pissed off loyal users and caused them to leave the app. Some users say “The VCs would rather the product be ruined than miss an opportunity for 100–1000x, and if you don’t agree they will install adult supervision to do their bidding.”</p><p id="1c38">Now that you know the major downsides, let’s explore the top alternatives to Evernote.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Bear — Evernote alternative" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2496/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU" width="1248" height="684" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*6_CdK54qjiYkxtfU?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2264"><a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bear</a> is a beautifully-designed app that makes the note-taking process easier and smoother.

    <p>This 100 page document has recently made the rounds: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zao_AyBhNb8TPWrQqgXn5NzNAgfEqzTIaFYos7wdqGI/edit#"><em>Thiel on Progress and Stagnation</em></a>. Despite looking quite comprehensive, I was surprised to see that quite a few of Thiel’s online writings were absent from the references section. Maybe the creators of the document left those out on purpose, but I suspect they might just not have been aware of them. A lot of Thiel’s online writings appear in relatively obscure places, and I haven’t been able to find a good list that includes all of them. So here is a list of everything Peter Thiel has <em>written online</em>, as far as I’m aware of:</p>

        <p>Pushing the limits of mobility and performance has become easier now that the iPad Pro has the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXQT2LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-2nd-generation-us-english">Magic Keyboard</a> and Visual Studio Code can be web-based as <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It’s pretty nice but has some shortcomings. This article covers both the workflow and <a href="https://gitlab.com/mterhar/code-server-buildtools">configuration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-workflow">Summary of the workflow</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wake iPad, attach keyboard</li>

<li>Checkout repo (or resume existing)</li>
<li>Preview markdown, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">code spell checker</a></li>
<li><code>Cmd+shift+C</code> to open a console and run build, test, etc</li>
<li>Commit updates, get immediate pipeline feedback from <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow">GitLab plugin</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="not-for-everyone">Not for everyone</h2>
<p>Depending on the types of software being developed, the deficiencies in this workflow may overwhelm the benefits.  I talk about some of the problems with the workflow later on. If you want to be talked out of it, <a href="#problems">check that out first</a>. Otherwise, read on for all the neat outcomes and surprises.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Portable device</li>
<li>Long battery</li>
<li>Drawings and illustrations</li>
<li>Cloudy and containerized work</li>
</ol>

<p>For the following barrage of screenshots, they are from when I was working on <a href="https://brownfield.dev/post/2020-07-05-introducing-lab-assistant/">Lab Assistant</a> from my iPad. It seemed like a good place to start recording some of the ease and struggles.</p>

<p>When starting on a new project or picking up work on this device for the first time, from that home location pull up a terminal (<code>Cmd+Shift+C</code>) and run <code>git clone</code>. This will create the new directory and fill it up with code.  If it’s a microservice situation, create a directory and clone all the various repos into that.</p>

<p>Sadly, uploading images directly to GitLab is one-at-a-time so squashing commits is much more important.  It’s also hard to format images for the web.</p>
<h3 id="switching-gears-to-blog-post">Switching gears to blog post</h3>
<p>The go workflow is pretty slick. Not a lot of stuff missing with the basics.  I’m also trying to use this workflow for making the blog post you’re reading right now.  Drafting the text is nice and easy. The spell checker plugin makes it better than my standard <code>Sublime -&gt; MS Word</code> workflow.</p>
<p>The biggest deficiency is image formatting and organization.  The iPad is great for making diagrams but once the images are saved, getting them into a web-optimized format and loaded into the repository is a hassle. Especially because you can only upload one file at a time to GitLab’s “upload file” interface. I did realize the WebIDE can do multiple uploads, but only too late.</p>
<p>Once the files are in the repo, they’re gigantic PNG files which should be shrunk, cropped, and optimized for web display. I need to find some tool to plug this gap in my creative work.</p>

<p>After uploading the images, renaming them and adding references, it’s time to take a look at what was built.</p>

<p>Every change to the code is detected and the site is rebuilt. Since code-server saves the files every time you stop typing, it leads to a lot of rebuilds. The good news is that they take a dozen milliseconds each.</p>

<p>This review app URL in my configuration is tied to a DNS and internal IP address so it’s only accessible to me and others within my network or on a VPN. If you’re working on something public, exposing and sharing the review app may help with reviews and collaboration. It’s probably easier to just use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/">GitLab’s review apps</a> in that case though.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-conclusions">Workflow conclusions</h2>
<p>The bottom line is that using an 11-inch iPad Pro with the magic keyboard is a nice way to work comfortably anywhere. Even if the work is relatively intensive coding or authoring.</p>

<p>I will continue to use this workflow for a month or two and update about what enhancements come up or if I abandon it eventually.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is about how I arrived at this setup, what it took to get it configured, and how I plan on managing it.</p>
<h2 id="how-things-were">How things were</h2>
<p>For the past few years, I’ve been trying to find a lightweight way to get all the benefits of cloud and remote computing while having a comfortable and minimal developer experience. Small devices that were attempted in the past had too many compromises related to performance and feedback.</p>
<p>The prior evaluations have been erratic because it’s tough to tell which combination of physical devices and services can yield a favorable result. Here are some of the things I’ve tried that didn’t pan out.</p>
<p>All of the below are working from an iPad using various Apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>MacBook 11 inch air:  Screen was very low resolution, performance lacking</li>
<li>MacBook 12 inch:  At the time, I had a requirement for windows development and the devices (even i7) couldn’t seem to keep up with visual studio in debug mode plus a database</li>
<li>iPad GitLab’s built-in WebIDE: lack of terminals and listing and compilers, feedback loop through pipelines is too slow</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Working Copy</strong> for git repos: great repo management and multi-file workflow, same lack of terminals and pipeline-based feedback</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Screens</strong> with full MacOS on the tiny screen: native workflow so pretty good but exceptionally expensive and clipboard troubles make it frustrating</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Prompt</strong> to use a Linux shell to do things: good for administrative but session time-outs and multi-file editing is poor experience</li>
</ol>
<p>I was recently convinced to try Visual Studio Code and noticed that it has a code-server hosted web editor option. <strong>Evaluation time!</strong></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-code-server">Setting up code-server</h2>
<p>The Visual Studio Code installation is a regular software installer on MacOS. Just install it. Super easy.</p>
<p>The code-server installation has some options like a simple web server that runs on the same Mac system. I consider this to be a copy of the <code>Screens</code> workflow so I’m not going to try this.</p>
<p>There is a code-server installation option that is to run as a container. This piqued my interest since containers are neat and flexible. This can be combined with the GitLab CI pipeline to build replacement custom containers to increase the built-in capabilities.  Linuxserver.io offers this with a templating/overlay mechanism to make some of the same enhancements I have done.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-kubernetes">Why not Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>In the interest of doing everything the hardest way imaginable, I took the code-server docker container and spun it up in my local Kubernetes cluster so I could benefit from the infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ingress to a friendly domain name</li>
<li>Certificates issued from Lets Encrypt</li>
<li>Resilience and fail-over</li>
<li>Ephemeral filesystem as a scratchpad</li>
<li>Persistent storage for home directory</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ingress">Ingress</h3>
<p>The main ingress configuration to access <code>code.p.terharlab.com</code> is set to connect to the code-server service.</p>
<p>I also added a Kubernetes service for 1313 and an Ingress mapping my internal load balancer to that service. Now I can pull up <code>hugo server --bind=0.0.0.0 --appendPort=false --baseURL={hugo ingress}</code> And it will attach to a service. I attached this Hugo port to an internal ingress rather than the public one to keep it walled off from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="resilience-and-fail-over">Resilience and fail-over</h3>
<p>Since the storage is external to the pod, if the pod moves around, the storage will be re-attached. The kubelet scheduler will make sure a code-server keeps running and if it moves from one node to another, the ingress and services will reconfigure to get traffic to the right place.</p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-filesystem">Ephemeral filesystem</h3>
<p>When running the container, if you want to add something like golang or a different version of python, it’s easy enough. Just run <code>apt-get</code> or download binaries and put them in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. If there is a problem with the tool, just restart the pod and it’ll go away since <code>/usr</code> and <code>/etc</code> are ephemeral.</p>
<p>I followed the enhancement process below to add <code>go</code>, <code>hugo</code>, <code>kubectl</code>, and <code>helm</code> to the image so I can build my lab-assistant application and post to my blog. This just requires updating the <code>Dockerfile</code> and restarting the pod to get the new container.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h3>
<p>To be sure that the day-to-day configuration updates don’t get lost in the ether when the container restarts, the entire <code>/home/coder</code> directory is in the persistent volume. In my environment, this creates an iscsi volume and attaches it to the container to preserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>dotfiles</li>
<li>repositories</li>
<li>go (packages)</li>
<li><code>/home/coder/.local/share/code-server</code>
<ul>
<li>extensions</li>
<li>logs</li>
<li>config files</li>
<li>spell checker library</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Subsequently, Facebook barred multiple&nbsp;individuals from its platform — including&nbsp;far-right political activist&nbsp;Faith Goldy and "white nationalist"&nbsp;Kevin Goudreau — and a host of&nbsp;groups, including the Soldiers of Odin, the Canadian Nationalist Front, the Aryan Strikeforce and the Wolves of Odin.</p>  <p>Facebook is under fire from those who accuse it of&nbsp;allowing hatred to spread on its platform.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/snap-says-facebook-ad-boycotts-opened-the-door-with-advertisers.html">A consumer boycott&nbsp;campaign</a> has led top brands like Unilever, Adidas and Microsoft to pull their ads from Facebook.</p>  <p>Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook Canada, said the partnership with Ontario Tech&nbsp;has been in the works for a while.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook originally planned to announce the partnership in March but it was delayed by the pandemic.</p>  <p>The agreement with the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism is above and beyond Facebook's current attempts to keep online hate off its platform; Chan said he hopes it will help the social media giant spot emerging tactics and trends.</p>  <p>"Our challenge ... is to better understand how these trends are evolving and to stay one step ahead of them," he said.</p>  <h2>A global hub for studying online hate</h2>  <p>The money will allow the centre to hire an additional person and, according to a media release from Facebook and Ontario Tech,&nbsp;is meant to help it become a "go to" knowledge hub on hate and violent extremism,&nbsp;"providing high-level expertise to national, international and global partners through evidence based education, training and programming."</p>  <p>While critics may say that $500,000 over five years is too little, too late, Perry said it will make a big difference to her organization's ability to monitor hate and violent extremism online.</p>  <p>Separately, Perry's centre also&nbsp;has received funding from the federal Department of Public Safety and the Department of National Defence.</p>    <p>Perry said there has been an increase in far right activity online in Canada. A recent <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Online-Environmental-Scan-of-Right-wing-Extremism-in-Canada-ISD.pdf">interim study</a> by her centre and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue between January 2019 and January 2020 identified&nbsp;6,600 Canadian groups, channels, accounts and pages identified with right-wing extremism&nbsp;across seven social media platforms — sites which&nbsp;collectively reached&nbsp;over 11 million users.</p>  <p>She said&nbsp;far-right supporters also&nbsp;have been showing up at anti-lockdown protests in Canada, and have crashed&nbsp;Black Lives Matter demonstrations to disrupt them.</p>  <p>"We're seeing increased rates of uncivil and hateful behaviour online coming from people who don't affiliate with these groups, so they are nonetheless absorbing some of those narratives and some of that sentiment," she said.&nbsp;"At the extreme, there are people who are acting on these sentiments."</p>  <p>Perry said the most dangerous threats&nbsp;emerging online&nbsp;are the incel movement and so-called "accelerationist" groups like the pro-gun, anti-government Boogaloo Boys, who believe that America is headed for a second civil&nbsp;war and want to speed its arrival.</p>  <p><strong>Watch: Far-right Boogaloo movement gathers steam in Canada</strong></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>A loose collective known as the Boogaloo movement has been in the spotlight in recent weeks.

By the end of the year, he said,&nbsp;it plans to overhaul its advertising system to prevent people from placing discriminatory ads for things like jobs, credit or housing.</p>  <p>Facebook also&nbsp;is planning a series of roundtables in the fall on social justice and anti-discrimination measures, including one on Indigenous questions.</p>  <p><em>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Ramping up on a new software project is hard</strong>, both for the person ramping up and for the team that supports this personâ€™s onboarding process. Itâ€™s especially worse when multiple people start onboarding the same project at the same time, which happened to my team recently: our projectâ€™s area of influence has grown quickly recently, and as a result, weâ€™re seeing dozens of developers starting to contribute to the project.</p>

<p>This sudden spike in interest lead to what I call â€œonboarding loadâ€� for our core team, as we suddenly faced pressure to help newcomers learn and navigate the codebase, while simulteanously trying to keep up with our day-to-day tasks.</p>

<h3 id="deflecting-pressure">Deflecting pressure</h3>

<p>To reduce this pressure on our core team, I recently introduced a â€œcode walkthroughâ€� in the projectâ€™s codebase. Itâ€™s essentially a collection of high-quality, high-context code comments â€œtaggedâ€� with a <code>[docs/walkthrough]</code> line comment. When newcomers come our way and want to learn more about our project, I point them to a GitHub search for that special identifier in the projectâ€™s codebase to pull up all those great code comments to learn about the project. (They could also clone the code locally and search for that identifier using their code editor, but a GitHub search is available to everyone.)</p>

<p>Here are some examples of such high-context comments and the different purposes they serve:</p>

<p><strong>Navigation and flow</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# This module is responsible for generating the content to insert in the &lt;head&gt;
# HTML tag across all pages.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# This class is the entrypoint to all output generation. From here, content
# flows down into controllers, then into serializers and formatters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# This is an example of an implementation that doesn't feel like it's the
# right way to do it, but after looking at profiles and traces, we know
# that this implementation performs better than a SQL-only solution.
#
# There's currently no good index on the `xyz` table to quickly search
# for nested values, so it ends up being faster to filter through all
# values in Ruby than it is to filter those out using a `WHERE`
# clause at the database level. We're looking into remodeling this data.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Trivia</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# Even though this class usually handles objects of type X, this one
# is an exception because it can be overridden by people manually creating
# resource of the same name.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Resiliency</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# Historically, we kept track of the resource count by incrementing a value in a
# key-value store whenever a resource was created. However, because of scaling
# constraints, we started tracking this value using a proper data ETL process.
# We now simply read the count from that data store and cache it aggressively.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code># [docs/walkthrough]
# By default, this class (including its subclasses) doesn't expose any method
# to the outside world. To do so, methods must be marked with the "world_public" 
# identifier. This is a safe-by-default way to avoid allocating wrapper objects,
# while still allowing public methods to be created for internal use.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that the documentation is built into the code, so the risk that it becomes stale or outdated is much lower than if that documentation lived outside of the code itself.</p>

<p>One thing you can play around with is moving up and down levels of abstraction throughout the comments. Some of them may explain why a specific function is implemented this way, while others may explain the business domain history behind this legacy module.</p>

<h3 id="sounds-great-how-do-i-get-started">Sounds great! How do I get started?</h3>

<p>As a starting point, identify existing high-quality comments in your project, and tag them with the special identifier of your choice. Then, look for areas in the codebase that would benefit from having a little bit more context and documentation, and take some time to write clear, helpful comments that you can add that special tag to. Finally, once you have a generous collection of high-quality comments with that special identifier, start pointing newcomers to search for this identifier, and let them soak up all that context.</p>

<p>As the documentation shepherd on your team, always be on the lookout for opportunities to write more of those high-context code comments: youâ€™ll be rewarded for it in the future, either by your colleagues thanking you for writing those comments that helped them step up quickly, or by your boss for reducing the â€œonboarding loadâ€� I mentioned earlier on the rest of the team, who instead were able to focus on the task at hand.</p>

<p>Great software documentation is like a flywheel. Itâ€™s hard to write at first, and the return on investment is not immediately visible. But with time, it compounds, and eventually, youâ€™ll wonder how you managed to live without it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have started to be more conscious about privacy over the Internet, and one of the most important aspects to take care of when talking about privacy and security is where to store your passwords, as important as what passwords you use.</p>

<p>Most people (including me until some weeks ago) use the same password everywhere to easily remember it later.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to use iOS, Google or Firefox password tools, the problem with that is that you are forced into their ecosystem, and one should always think about who <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/your-passwords-online.html">let in charge of your keys</a></p>



<p>It is impossible to keep a lot of passwords in our memory, and writing them down is not a good idea either. I started to keep them in a text file encrypted with a password, but it was not the best solution.</p>

<p>So I started to use Chrome password manager, but I  did not want to install it on the iPad, even on the PC, I started using Firefox on the laptop too.</p>

<p>So I started to look for an independent password manager tool, but almost all of them required a paid account. And I wanted to have full control over my passwords. So, I decided to use Bitwarden, because there is a self-hosted option</p>

<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>

<p>Bitwarden is an Open Source password manager tool, you can host in your server with Docker, this is maybe the most secure way to manage your passwords because you are in full control of them. Of course, they are on a server open to the Internet so they will never be completely secure.</p>

<h3 id="main-features">Main features</h3>

<h4 id="different-type-of-containers">Different type of containers</h4>

<p>Bitwarden is not only useful to manage your passwords, but it can also be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Login Passwords</strong>: As all main tools, it records the url, the username, and password.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit Cards</strong>: Credit cards can also be stored on Bitwarden server</li>
  <li><strong>Identity</strong>: You can store all data of your identity, like Passport number, Social Security number, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Note</strong>: This feature I use a lot, they are like post-it, but secure post-it, I mainly use them to store the keys to unlock sites when 2FA fail, I keep the scratch codes in there.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h4>

<p>Of course, you can generate the password with the tool, and adjust the type of password you want.</p>

<p>You can generate passwords of different sizes, from 5 to 128 characters, and if the password will contain: Upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters. You can also set the minimum quantity of numbers and special characters.</p>

<h4 id="export-and-import">Export and Import</h4>

<p>You can export and import the data, this must be done carefully, because it is exported a plain text document, and that document should be deleted once it is not needed anymore.</p>

<h4 id="reports">Reports</h4>

<p>Bitwarden offers different reports that help you a lot to keep your credentials secure</p>

<h5 id="exposed-password-report">Exposed Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one of the best features it has, it shows you all the passwords you use that has been exposed on the web because someplace you used them has been hacked.</p>

<p>Be sure the change all passwords that appear on this report.</p>

<h5 id="reused-password-report">Reused Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one is pretty self-explanatory, this report shows all sites where you have used the same password, try to change all of them to random passwords, if one site is compromised the hackers will not gain access to other sites where you use the same login and password.</p>

<h5 id="weak-password-report">Weak Password Report</h5>

<p>Here you can review all accounts that have weak passwords, usually the same where you have reused passwords. Keep all passwords randomly generated, and with long strings, no less than 14 characters.</p>

<h5 id="unsecured-sites-report">Unsecured Sites Report</h5>

<p>Here you will have listed all sites where you have an account that does not use SSL, in other words, the signing url is http and not https, on this sites you should of course use unique passwords, as it is easier to lose that password, and the hacker should not be able to use it in any other site.</p>

<h5 id="inactive-two-factor-authentication">Inactive two-factor authentication</h5>

<p>In this report, it will be listed all sites where 2FA is available, but you do not have it enabled, be sure to use 2FA on every site that has available. This way even if your password gets compromised, nobody will be able to access your info on that site.</p>

<h5 id="data-breach-report">Data Breach Report</h5>

<p>You can check here if your user name or email has been compromised in any data breach.</p>

<p>The report will show you what info has been made public together with your email address or login, the only thing you can do, is to change the passwords you used on those sites.</p>

<h4 id="two-step-login">Two-Step Login</h4>

<p>Your Bitwarden account can also be secured by enabling 2FA, you have these options to set it up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authenticator APP: Like the ones from Google, Microsoft or Authy.</li>
  <li>Yubico: You need to buy a hardware YubiKey to use this method.</li>
  <li>Duo.com: You need an account with them</li>
  <li>Fido:  This one is also from Yubico</li>
  <li>Email: You will get an email with the code every time you want to login</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-hosted-options">Self Hosted Options</h3>

<h4 id="official-apps">Official Apps</h4>

<p>You have good documentation on the site to host it on your server with Docker:</p>

<p>You will need to install at least <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/server">the server</a> which you can use with your browser extension and your mobile app.</p>

<p>But there is another option for your personal use.</p>

<h4 id="bitwardenrs">Bitwarden_rs</h4>

<p>This one is the option for  persona use, it is small and also have all features the official one.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs">installation instructions here</a></p>

<p>But, here I will let you how I installed on my server.</p>

<pre><code>version: '3.3'
services:
  server:
    restart: always
    container_name: bitwarden
    volumes:
      - 'bw-data:/data/'
    ports:
      - '8888:80'
    image: 'bitwardenrs/server:latest'
    labels:
      - "docker-volume-backup.stop-during-backup=true"
  backup:
    image: futurice/docker-volume-backup:2.0.0
    environment:
      AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: XXXXXXX      # S3 bucket which you own, and already exists
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: YYYYYYYYYYY # Read AWS secrets from environment (or a .env file)
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # Allow use of the "stop-during-backup" feature
      - bw-data:/backup/bitwareden-backup:ro

volumes:
  bw-data:
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration, you will have two containers, one with Bitwarden, and the second one that will take care to back up your database to AWS S3 or any compatible option. Remember that your vault is encrypted.</p>

<p>You will now only need Nginx or Caddy in front of it, I am using Caddy 2, with this configuration:</p>

<pre><code>bw.mysite.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8888
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use Nginx, you will need something like this:</p>

<pre><code> location /{
  proxy_pass https://your_local_host:8888;
  proxy_redirect off;
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Url-Scheme $scheme;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Among with other server configurations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Consider using a Password Manager tool, I recommend you Bitwarden, but you can use anyone you trust, I know that NextCloud comes with an add-on for it too, I think that is also a great option, what you should not do, is to re-use passwords, or use weak passwords.</p>

<p>Security on the Internet is as important as security in the real world, and you do not let your home or car keys anywhere, you keep them secure and with you.</p>

But, <em>what on earth is that?</em></p><p>If you're not familiar, <strong>Static Generation</strong> is the process of dynamically generating pages at build time. For example, an e-commerce website might generate a static HTML page for each product in their catalog as oppose to the traditional approach of using a server to load in product information from a database.</p><p>This is nice because static HTML files are fast to serve.

For a site with thousands of articles or products, this could take a long time.</p><h2>Incremental Static Generation</h2><p>To address this issue, the Next.js contributors have been working on giving static pages the ability to be "revalidated" at runtime.</p><p>In practise, this works with the <code>revalidate</code> option in the <code>getStaticProps()</code> method of a Next.js page. The <code>revalidate</code> option, if specified, will instruct the page to be regenerated at a given interval.</p><p>When a user visits an "out of date" page, they will be served up a "stale" version. Traffic on the site will then cause the page to be re-rendered in the background meaning that the next users to visit the page will see the latest, "up to date" version.</p><h2>It gets better...</h2><p>Instead of having to define all pages at build time and then incrementally rebuilding them at runtime, you can now <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration">register new static pages at <em>runtime</em></a>.</p><p>This is like automatic server-side rendering but once rendered, pages are served statically and can then also be updated on demand.</p><p>Here's a <a href="https://static-tweet.now.sh/">demo with an explanation</a> if you don't believe me...</p><p>2020 <em>really is</em> a crazy year.</p><h2>Big Wins</h2><p>In my opinion, this approach to static generation is a defining moment for <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> which could make it far more adoptable than before.</p><p>You just can't beat the speed of pure HTML.</p><p>If you can build complex dynamic sites with the simplicity of a tool like <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> why use anything else?</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Late last week, Intel announced that <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/ceo-remarks-earnings-call-2Q2020.pdf">they were delaying their next generation of chips</a>. This is big news and the stock took a tumble after the announcement. This has big implications for the whole industry, and arguably the world.</p>



<p>The issue is that they announced a delay of their 7nm chips by six months. They were already behind schedule with 7nm, by contrast TSMC has been shipping others’ 7nm products for over six months. The fact that this comes on top of Intel hitting 10nm roughly two years behind schedule speaks to two big challenges for the company. </p>



<p>First, this has all sorts of impact on their financial results. Not least, they do not have sufficient capacity for their trailing edge, 14nm process, which has crimped revenue from their inability to meet demand. This hurts the whole PC ecosystem, as large companies delay their purchases of hardware which ripples through the whole supply chain. </p>



<p>This also opens the door for Intel’s competitors. On the PC side, <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/06/23/apple-silicon-first-impressions/">this makes Apple’s move to their own silicon</a> even more important. Apple likely knew of Intel’s delay a few months ago, and likely catalyzed them to move even faster with their transition. More importantly, it creates a big problem for Intel in the data center, which is their largest profit driver. Server customers want the best performance. Cloud scale providers – <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/06/17/intel-follow-up-data-centers/">who consume something like 70% of Intel’s data center products</a> – make purchases based on performance per dollar per watt. Any competing product just got a big leg up in that math. All those competitors are using 7nm now, and basically have a year to further erode Intel’s once-dominant share. There are other factors that will keep those customers using Intel, but the math plays a big role in determining the purchase decisions. For companies like AMD and privately-held Ampere, this is very good news. It also gives a big boost to anyone else who still has an ARM CPU in the works, companies like Huawei and Amazon.</p>



<p>Beyond those immediate financial problems this news poses what we see as Intel’s identity crisis. For almost thirty years, the company has prided itself on producing the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology. They ceded that with the 10nm miss two years ago, but they could have convinced themselves that was a one-time fluke. Fool yourself once…. The rest of the world has moved <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2018/11/01/you-too-can-build-your-own-chip-for-only-30-million/">to a fabless model</a>, but for Intel that vertically integrated model goes to the core of their identity. Now it is not clear what they are.</p>



<p>After the announcement, the press focused on Intel’s admission that they would shift some GPU production to TSMC. This is a bit misleading as Intel has been producing chips at TSMC for close to a decade. They acquired Infineon’s mobile business Altera for FPGAs and have been running those as fabless through TSMC since acquisition. In hindsight, the fact that they could never shift those to internal production should have been viewed a major Defcon-1 Red Flag. </p>



<p>And this leads into the geopolitical realm. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/07/09/the-five-year-plan-for-semiconductors/">The whole industry has </a>recently woken up to the strategic value of Taiwan’s TSMC. In our earlier writing on the geopolitics of chips we have been careful to call out the fact the US does (did?) have advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. With Intel lagging, TSMC’s unique position becomes all the more apparent. </p>



<p>Intel still has a lot working in its favor. They still make a lot of money, $10 billion in the latest quarter. They have a tremendous reserve of talent, especially if recent executive changes means they can rehire employees who have exited over the past few years. They will get to 7nm eventually, and still have a credible path to 5nm and whatever lays beyond that. </p>



<p>That being said, Intel needs to think long and hard about its future. Do they want to be a 3rd party foundry and produce chips for others? They could still do that, but it would require tens of billions of dollars of investment, starting right now. Stay the course and milk the markets they still dominate? That sounds tolerable, but it is effectively the strategy they have employed for the past ten years, thus not sustainable indefinitely. Probably the best thing they could do would be to hunker down and invest heavily in their existing team, committing to never missing a deadline again. This would lkely require big organizational change and a major investment. Long ago, we semi-joked that <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2018/07/26/a-proposal-for-intel-time-to-go-private/">Intel should go private</a> and make the required changes away from the spotlight of the public market. That particular financial structure remains far-fetched, but the depth of change required still pertains. Intel needs to fix itself, and no amount of government subsidy will alter that. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C source code below is the common code that is required by any of the code samples that are generated above. &nbsp;Simply copy and paste the following code into a file called 'main.c' along with the dynamically generated code above in order to make a hard-coded program that will perform your intended regex search. &nbsp;Make sure the code below is passed before the dynamically generated code above. &nbsp;You can compile the code using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>gcc main.c

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, you'll find an interactive visualization that you can use to simulate regular expressions. &nbsp;You can type any regular expression and the tool will automatically create two diagrams that correspond to your regular expression. &nbsp;Both of these diagrams are interactive, zoomable and include support for a fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first diagram is a parse tree. &nbsp;Constructing a parse tree is the first step that a regular expression engine will perform in order to decide what meaning each character will have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click on individual nodes in the parse tree to highlight the corresponding character in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can also go the other way and click on individual characters in the regular expression to quickly find the corresponding characters in the parse tree. &nbsp;By reviewing how the characters are grouped together in the parse tree, you can gain insights about the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to each other in the regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second diagram shows a control flow graph corresponding to your regular expression. &nbsp;This control flow graph illustrates the step by step process that is undertaken whenever your regex is matched against a piece of text. &nbsp; When attempting to match your regular expression, the process starts at the 'BEGIN' node and ends at either the 'MATCH' or 'FAILURE' node. &nbsp;Any path from the 'BEGIN' node to the 'MATCH' node corresponds to a piece of text that matches your regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nodes in the control flow graph correspond directly to one or more characters in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see the corresponding nodes highlighted in your original regular expression and the parse tree. &nbsp;Also note that clicking on characters in your regex will also highlight any associated nodes in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult to truly understand how your regular expression works without seeing the decisions it makes when attempting to match a given piece of text. &nbsp;For this reason, every time you make changes to your regular expression, this visualization tool will automatically generate a piece of text that contains at least one match to your regular expression. &nbsp;If you want to review how the matching process work with your own customized piece of text, simply change the input value for the search string and the animation will update automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of matching the regular expression starts at the 'BEGIN' node and continues by following the arrows to arrive at the nodes that actually do the work of the regular expression itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of writing this sentence, all regular expressions that this visualizer tool supports are ultimately transformed into an control flow graph that consists of the following 5 types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &nbsp;<strong>CHAR</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a specific character at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;If the character matches, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>2) &nbsp;<strong>CLASS</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a class of characters at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;This node type effectively does the same thing as the first node type, except it allows for more than one possible character at the current position in the search text. &nbsp;If the current character in the text is among the list of acceptable characters specified by this node, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>3) &nbsp;<strong>SPLIT</strong>&nbsp;This node type performs a 'split' operation. &nbsp;This is a situation where the regular expression matcher has a more than one possible path to continue through the control flow graph. &nbsp;In programming terms, this node effectively does the same thing as forking a process or splitting off work into two separate threads. &nbsp;This can also be implemented in a single thread by trying both paths one at time and pushing saved information onto a stack. &nbsp;In computer science theory, this node type should remind you of the difference between DFAs and NFAs.</li>
<li>4) &nbsp;<strong>ANCHOR</strong>&nbsp;This node type represents the commonly used 'beginning of string' or 'end of string' regular expression characters. &nbsp;This node is type is quite simple, as it simply checks whether the current position in the string is, respectively, at the first position, or the last position. &nbsp;If the check succeeds, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>5) &nbsp;<strong>PROGRESS</strong>&nbsp;This node type is necessary to avoid infinite loops in certain regular expressions that can include repetitions of possibly zero length strings. &nbsp;Without this node, there are cases where the control flow graph could potentially contain cycles that cause us to move around forever without making any progress. &nbsp;Each time a progress node is visited, it makes sure that we've made some progress in matching the regex since the last visit. &nbsp;If we have made progress, we move to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If not, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may find it surprising, but most commonly used regular expressions can be described in terms of the above 5 simple node types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of this visualization tool is help you understand the precise meaning of the characters in a regular expression. &nbsp;Therefore, this the tool will also cross-compile your regular expression into a hard-coded C program that implements a search for the regex pattern that you specified. &nbsp;Each of the nodes in the control flow graph has a direct correspondence to several lines of C source code that are expressed below the two diagrams. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see which lines of code correspond to the node that you've selected.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_this_character(current_character, CHARACTER_TO_MATCH)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the implementation of a 'CHAR' node, we first use the 'safely_get_character' function to pick out the next character from the string being searched. &nbsp;The implementation of the 'safely_get_character' function is listed above in the 'Common C Code' section. &nbsp;This function is very simple since it just checks to make sure we're still within the bounds of the string that's being search, and if so, it returns character at the current position. &nbsp;If we're past the end of the string, we just directly exit the process. &nbsp;This corresponds to moving to the 'failure' node in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we've obtained the current character, we check to make sure that it matches the literal character that was specified in the regular expression using the 'matches_this_character' function. &nbsp;Here is the implementation of the matches_this_character function. &nbsp;As you can see, this function is very simple since it just checks to make sure that the current character in the string being searched is the same as the literal character that was supplied in the regex.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_one_of_these_characters(current_character, NUM_CHARACTERS, CHARACTER_1, CHARACTER_2, CHARACTER_3, ..., CHARACTER_N)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 'CLASS' node …</p></div></div>

    <p>Back in the Renaissance, having skill in many different areas was seen as a good thing. But things changed. Movements such as the industrial revolution required individuals to specialize in one task to repeat it over and over and over—like cogs.</p>
<p>The phrase, "Jack of all trades, master of none," has been used to negatively refer to people who engaged in eclectic activities. Even in today's culture, doing different activities with less specialization has bad connotations.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with <em>portfolio careerist</em> Carmen Chamorro for a new episode of Getting Simple. We talked about the benefits of working in different fields, managing multiple interests, and how recognizing a potential Renaissance-like profile might positively influence your career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust your nature. Be you. Don't be scared. We are all needed and we are all here. There is a balance in the world. We just need to go to the right place of the puzzle. You are here with a profile, and you are here to use it and to be authentic. Trust yourself, accept yourself, and have fun. —Carmen Chamorro</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started at Facebook back in 2012, it was developed internally before being released as open-source in 2015. In 2018 the project was moved to the newly created GraphQL Foundation, hosted by the Linux foundation. GraphQL creator Lee Byron has stated his aim is to make it ubiquitous across web platforms. Let’s look at how plausible that perspective is.</p>
<h2>A bit of theory</h2>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. Developers create a schema that contains all the data clients can query through the service. This schema contains object types that determine the object you can request and the types it has. The schema is the basis all queries get checked against and then, after being validated, executed. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.

    </span></p>
<h2>A bit of practice</h2>
<p>Let’s check out how it actually works by looking at a simple example like a forum, blog or social media. In our example let’s say users have four properties: username, email, location and ID and can create posts with titles. Now if you need to create a profile component that only shows the username and ID, you don’t need the user’s email and location. With REST and other web service architectures, the API returns all user data and there’s no way to request specifically what you need without fetching unnecessary data. Doesn’t sound like a big problem? Just look at Facebook accounts and how many variables they have and you’ll easily get why they started developing GraphQL.</p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>GraphQL allows you to request exactly the parameters you want and the API responds with only the data you requested. It also does this via a single endpoint that handles all the client’s requests. That was just a basic query. One of the advantages of GraphQL is the ability to nest queries so it can be expanded to fetch a number of variables. </p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the above-mentioned example of a blog/forum/social media API. What if your profile component needs to be a bit more complex? We’ll make a query that requests some basic user info as well as post titles for that particular user so that the profile provides a glimpse of the user’s activity as well as basic information.</p>
<h2>Why development teams are adopting GraphQL?</h2>
<p>One of the surveys directed to a variety of companies having experience with GraphQL asked their CTOs and lead developers why they decided to pivot to GraphQL. The survey identified six main benefits (<em>Development Velocity, Modularity, Scalability, Performance, Reliability, Security</em>) and asked responders how strongly they would agree/disagree with the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We were able to speed up our development using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>We were able to scale our projects faster with GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>It was easier to unify our APIs (e.g., Microservices, legacy endpoints, third-party services, etc.)</em></li>
<li><em>There has been an increase in performance using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>Our architecture is more stable, with decreased downtime, and fewer errors</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The results are:</p>

<p>The interpretation of the survey’s results was summed up closed in the table below. The most important thought is that GraphQL managed to provide what teams were looking for that small to medium as well as large enterprise teams. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team size</th>
<th>What they wanted to achieve</th>
<th>What they’ve achived</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>50-100 &amp; 100+ devs</td>
<td>Faster development speed, better scalability, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10-50 devs</td>
<td>Better modularity, higher performance</td>
<td>Faster development, better infrastructure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>up to 10 devs</td>
<td>Faster development, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Simple and flexible</h2>
<p>GraphQL not only straightforward, but it’s also extremely adaptable. GraphQL is client-driven and it’s creators emphasize they were focused on the needs of the client, not the server. That’s also why graphQL is so flexible so that it’s as easy as possible to use for clients.  You can use GraphQL with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python,</li>
<li>React </li>
<li>Java,</li>
<li>C++, </li>
<li>PHP, </li>
</ul>
<p>and a number of others as it’s meant to be a one size fits all solution that retrieves data regardless of the service, platform, or coding language. Can it become widely used across all platforms? Time will tell, but it certainly has all the tools for that.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

				<p>Remember the Ubuntu Unity spin edition that popped up a few months ago? Well, the same young developer behind that product is at it again. In a cryptic new Twitter post of only the words <em>“Coming soon! Stay tuned!”</em> from the new handle of <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu Web</a>, Rudra Saraswat has my attention.</p>
<p>The Twitter bio for this new account is really all we have to go on at this point, but color me intrigued. It seems to be positioned as an alternative to Chrome OS. Ironically, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-secret-origins-of-googles-chrome-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project that became Chrome OS</a> was originally running a modified Firefox UI.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“<span>Ubuntu Web combines the power of Ubuntu &amp; Firefox to give you a powerful, open source web OS.</span>“</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As we move more and more to a cloud-focused future, the combination of Ubuntu running <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/new-years-resolution-try-using-firefox-full-time-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> in a dedicated UI could make for a pretty powerful mashup. And as someone who is already concerned with web standards moving towards a world of only tech surrounding the Chrome browser, it’s a welcome alternative.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coming soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>— Ubuntu Web (@ubunweb) <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb/status/1285993537499095040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While this isn’t the first time we’ve seen cloud-first distros in the world of Linux, I hope the team at Ubuntu Web can really find some traction. Rudra’s previous work with <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/my-three-weeks-with-the-system76-lemur-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a> could lay a decent groundwork. Unity had many cloud elements built into the interface that with some tweaking may be able to leverage new hooks powered by Firefox.</p>
<p>We wish the Ubuntu Web team luck in this new venture and we’ll keep a close eye on any progress of this intriguing project.</p>

<p>Before delving into <strong>Privacy and Data Protection Issues with the Adoption of SaaS</strong>, let’s look into <strong>Privacy</strong> as a whole in the real-world. One of the more obvious ways when it comes to data harvesting is through online shopping when we key in our details. However, there are less obvious ways like <a href="https://clearcode.cc/blog/what-is-data-broker/#:~:text=Data%20brokers%20(aka%20information%20brokers,with%20data%20from%20other%20sources%20(">data brokers creating profiles of online users</a>. There could be anywhere up to over 1300 data points collected; these could include data on sexuality, marital status, browsing history and political affiliations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html">Acxiom is supposed to have data on 10% of the world’s population</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Data-Brokers.png" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Data-Brokers.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">What is your data worth?</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2013 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/intelligence-leaders-push-back-on-leakers-media/2013/06/09/fff80160-d122-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html">Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks</a>, and indicated how there’s mass government surveillance taking place as well. <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Data Protection</strong> is a heavy topic that is even debated today across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Privacy?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When considering <strong>Privacy</strong>, which is to do with <strong>Human Dignity</strong> and <strong>Autonomy</strong>, remember that <a href="http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_12.html">Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares Privacy as a human right</a> — “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence”. The article goes onto to say that the law is there to defend any individual who is subject to such interference.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protect-your-digital-footprint.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protect-your-digital-footprint.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: <a href="http://www.users.miamioh.edu/viscokj/IMS201/website/chapter-04.html">Protect your digital footprint</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, in legal terms <strong>Privacy</strong> is not an absolute right. National security or public safety are just two reasons where <strong>Privacy</strong> is not assured. But, what about the concept of <strong>Data Protection</strong>? <strong>Data Protection</strong> deals with how third parties collect, share, store, process and use information they have concerning us.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Data Protection in the Digital Age</h2>
<p>In the digital age, we exchange our data in order to use services, content and social media platforms.&nbsp; When you click Agree, you hand over your data to such platforms to utilize your information, which could mean selling it as well. In countries like Russia, Australia, and Brazil, their respective governments have access to our conversations, transactions and locations. Today, there are various internet policy forums like <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/">IGF</a>, the Council of Europe and OECD, and conferences like <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/cyfy/">CyFy</a> that are involved in shaping such concepts in the digital age. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/#:~:text=It's%20a%20security%20project%20that's,for%20which%20it%20offers%20apps.">WhatsApp in 2016 took the decision to install end-to-end encryption</a> all in the effort to secure the consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who read about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-awakening/">How Cambridge Analytica Sparked the Great Privacy Awakening</a> and/or watched how <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-great-hack-documentary/">Netflix’s&nbsp;<em>The Great Hack</em>&nbsp;Brings Our Data Nightmare to Life</a> will realize the importance of <strong>Data Privacy</strong>. The issue of privacy and its real-world intrigue is straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality of this can be seen in the diagram below:</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cambridge-Analytica.jpeg" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cambridge-Analytica.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: <a href="https://i.insider.com/5accc71a4d038654658b49cb?width=1100&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp">Facebook and Cambridge Analytica</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A more worrying article would be about Google and how it literally is Big Brother: <a href="https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/">Google collects a frightening amount of data about you</a>.&nbsp;All of these issues has led digital netizens to take matters into their own hands. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Anonymity tools like Tor</a> and encryption are widely used. Alternative digital business models, which are against the extraction and sale of data, are now largely considered. Over the last few years, the use of ad blockers have increased, and this has led companies to utilize advertising practices that are less invasive.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Does this Mean for SaaS?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Consider all that you have read thus far when it comes to <strong>Privacy</strong> and <strong>Data Protection</strong>. Now, let’s move onto Saas, and <strong>Privacy and Data Protection Issues with the Adoption of SaaS</strong>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5q_RXk_t7A">Software-as-a-Service&nbsp;(SaaS)</a>&nbsp;is not just a cloud-based delivery model, but also a service that allows organizations to cater to their IT service management needs. SaaS applications have a lot of benefits: saving money and time, keeping an eye on technology budgets as opposed to infrastructure or gaining access to the newest innovations. </p>
<p>With all these advantages offered by SaaS products, remember that they can be a focus of interest to even hackers. This is why certain protocols need to be considered. </p>
<p>These protocols are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Encrypt your data</li><li>Make privacy a priority</li><li>Educate your customers</li><li>Back-up user data in several locations</li><li>Utilize stronger passwords</li></ol>
<p>For more information, we believe that the article <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/privacy-policy-saas/#Privacy_Policies_For_Saas_What_And_Why">Privacy Policy for a SaaS Business</a> is an excellent starting point when it comes to ensuring transparency and integrity.</p>
<h2>How Secure is Hyvor Talk?</h2>
<p>We wrote <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">19 Reasons to Move Away From Disqus</a> sometime back, and one of the main reasons to move away from Disqus is to do with the issue of privacy. Hyvor Talk is very secure and we take the aspect of privacy very seriously.</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyvor-Talk-Privacy-Policy.png" alt="" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hyvor-Talk-Privacy-Policy.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>Caption: Part of <a href="https://hyvor.com/privacy-policy">our privacy policy</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/privacy-policy-common-issues/">One of the main issues with privacy policies today in the digital world</a> is the use of legalese, which makes the issue of understanding documentation very complicated. Complex terminology is something we have strayed away from, and have stuck to very simple descriptions. It needs to be reiterated that <strong>Hyvor Talk does not track users, and does not sell any data</strong> either, which are serious privacy issues faced by SaaS companies.</p>
<p>As a new commenting platform solution, Hyvor Talk, is fast changing how people interact with blogs, and it offers you a chance to understand our commenting platform and how different it is from its competitors. </p>
<p>To conclude, Hyvor Talk has a strong focus on SaaS security; and, we are focused on building trust in our product and to foster an ecosystem that customers feel comfortable using. As consumers become more knowledgeable regarding their personal security, there will be more secure products, which are sure to become a very attractive proposition to buyers.</p>

Despite that, we index and let you query <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/40k-sql-datasets">over 40,000 public datasets</a> with simple SQL.</p><p>This series of articles discusses our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/topic/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> and how we stay lean while still providing a lot of value to data scientists and engineers.</p><p>To run Splitgraph in production, we use Docker Compose. We found it to be a surprisingly effective solution. This article is a collection of tips and tricks for using Docker Compose that we discovered. We'll talk about:</p><ul><li>structuring a Compose dev-prod configuration using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends">override mixins</a></li><li>an automated deploy workflow</li><li>configuration generation, injection and live reloading</li><li>how we monitor our services in production</li></ul><section><h2 id="why-compose">Why Compose?</h2><p>We are eventually interested in moving to Kubernetes or Nomad (we're even writing a script that automatically converts Compose files to Nomad jobs!). But, these solutions felt like overkill for our use case.</p><p>Besides, we relied on Docker Compose a lot when building Splitgraph. Currently, we run <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/integration-tests">integration tests in CI</a> using it. We wanted to match the dev, CI and production workflow as closely as possible.</p></section><section><h2 id="compose-configs-and-mixins">Compose configs and mixins</h2><p>Docker Compose allows you to combine multiple Compose configurations into one at runtime. This feature is called <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends">"overrides"</a>.</p><p>Here's a sample Compose definition for a "prod" service:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.4"</span>

  <span>registry-db</span><span>:</span>

<span>services</span><span>:</span>

</code></pre><p>This can include:</p><ul><li>Bind mounts for source code for scripted languages</li><li>Flags for verbose logging</li><li>Using a more heavyweight Docker image with dev tooling or hot reloads</li><li>Publishing ports on the host to aid debugging</li></ul><p>This lets us avoid repetition in our configuration. We also use this idea to split up different aspects of the stack into separate Compose files. We call these "service groups".</p><p>We have runscripts that wrap Compose overrides to give the developer a single script. They can use it to run Compose commands on a service group. The script can inject the "dev" configuration if needed:</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash -e

if [[ "$1" == "--dev" ]] ; then
  DEV=1
  shift
fi

export CONFIG_HOME=${CONFIG_HOME-"$PWD"}

exec docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
    $( [[ -n $DEV ]] &amp;&amp; echo "-f docker-compose.dev.yml" ) \

    -f docker-compose.dbs.prod.yml \
    $( [[ -n $DEV ]] &amp;&amp; echo "-f docker-compose.dbs.dev.yml" ) $@
</code></pre></section><section><h2 id="deployment-workflow">Deployment workflow</h2><p>We deploy Splitgraph using GitLab CI. The deploy process runs in several stages.</p><section><h3 id="building-the-production-bundle">Building the production bundle</h3><p>First, we use our Makefile (we wrote more about how we use Makefiles in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/makefile">a previous blog post</a>) to build a "deploy bundle". This bundle is self-contained and includes only the files needed to run Splitgraph in production:</p><ul><li>Production Docker Compose configs</li><li>Runscripts that combine those configs into "service groups"</li><li>Other useful scripts for production: installation, backups, configuration management, helper script to load into the admin shell</li><li>Configuration templates</li></ul><p>We store the actual tag (commit hash) that we're deploying in a <code>.env</code> file in the bundle that every script sources.</p></section><section><h3 id="deploy-home-directory">Deploy home directory</h3><p>On the server, we have a "deploy home" directory that contains service configuration files. It also contains a <code>config.json</code> file that includes:</p><ul><li>configuration flags for the current deploy</li><li>secrets</li><li>third-party API keys</li></ul><p>The CI script copies the bundle into this directory and extracts it. We keep copies of previous deploy bundles too, each one in a timestamped directory. This means we can roll back to an earlier version in case of a failed deploy by running that bundle's installation script.</p></section><section><h3 id="pulling-and-tagging-the-containers">Pulling and tagging the containers</h3><p>The installation script first pulls all required containers from the GitLab CI registry. At this point, it uses the deploy's commit hash as the tag.</p><p>The script then retags these containers with a <code>:production</code> tag. This is to avoid Compose reloading all services on every deploy. If an image's tag (not only the SHA hash) has changed, Compose will treat the service's configuration as changed. Keeping the tag fixed prevents that.</p></section><section><h3 id="configuration-generation">Configuration generation</h3><p>The script then runs the "configurator". It's a container with a Python application that uses Jinja. It uses the bundle's config templates and the <code>config.json</code> file to regenerate configuration for all services that we run.</p><p>We wrote more about the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/integration-tests">configurator</a> in a previous blog post.</p><p>We bind mount configuration into containers. We prefer this to baking it into the image. This lets us make emergency hotfixes without having to go through the CI pipeline.</p></section><section><h3 id="database-migrations">Database migrations</h3><p>Next, the installation script runs schema migrations. We check all our migrations into version control and run integration tests on them in CI.</p><p>These migrations form part of the "admin" container. We also use this container to run other Splitgraph instance management tasks.</p><p>Finally, we implement a lot of Splitgraph functionality as PostgreSQL functions in languages like <code>PL/Python</code> or <code>PL/Lua</code>. We package those up as PostgreSQL extensions which we also install at migration time.</p></section><section><h3 id="reloading-services">Reloading services</h3><p>We have several service groups that we deploy one after another. We use <code>./service-runscript.sh up -d</code> to upgrade most of them. This means that Docker Compose only recreates containers for services with changed specifications. You can read more about this behavior in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/" as="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/">Compose documentation</a>.</p><p>This is not a zero downtime deploy, but we try to minimize excess container restarts by pinning third-party container hashes. For example, instead of <code>haproxy:latest</code>, we use <code>haproxy@sha256:e6f9faf0c2a0cf2d2d5a53307351fa896d...</code>.</p><p>In some cases, we run many copies of the same service group for high availability. This is the case for our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">REST API</a>. There, the script waits until the replica is healthy before upgrading the next one:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>#!/bin/bash -e</span>



<span>CONTAINER</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>


<span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>120</span>
<span>while</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>status</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span>docker inspect -f <span>'{{.State.Health.Status}}'</span> <span>"<span>$CONTAINER</span>"</span><span>)</span></span>
  <span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"<span>$status</span>"</span> <span>!=</span> <span>"starting"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>fi</span>
  <span>if</span> <span><span>((</span> timeout <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>))</span></span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"Timed out waiting for <span>$CONTAINER</span> to become healthy"</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>fi</span>
  <span>sleep</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span><span>$((</span> timeout <span>-</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span></span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for <span>$CONTAINER</span> to become healthy, <span>$timeout</span> s.."</span>
<span>done</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"<span>$status</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"unhealthy"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$CONTAINER</span> is unhealthy!"</span>
  <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fi</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$CONTAINER</span> is healthy."</span>
</code></pre></section><section><h3 id="reloading-configuration">Reloading configuration</h3><p>Most containers don't get recreated or restarted on deploy, which helps us minimize downtime. But what do we do if we need to reload a service's configuration without restarting it?</p><p>The answer is simple. Lots of services like HAProxy, Prometheus, PGBouncer or NGINX support configuration reloads via a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal. You can send a UNIX signal to a container with Docker:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span>docker <span>kill</span> --signal SIGHUP container_name</span></span>
</code></pre><p>All we need to do to apply new configuration is send <code>SIGHUP</code> to relevant containers after a deploy. If the configuration has errors, these services will silently switch back to the old one.</p><p>There's a caveat here with bind mounts. You have to make sure you're bind mounting <strong>the directory</strong> with the configuration file rather than the actual file. This is because of how Docker bind mounts interact with Linux inodes. More on <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15793#issuecomment-135411504" as="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15793#issuecomment-135411504">Docker GitHub</a>.</p></section><section><h3 id="healthchecks-and-monitoring">Healthchecks and monitoring</h3><p>As the final step, the deploy runs <code>docker-compose ps</code> to make sure all containers that have healthchecks pass them. If there are unhealthy containers, the deploy script raises an alert in our team chat.</p><p>We also use <a href="https://prometheus.io/" as="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/" as="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> to scrape various container statistics, plot them and alert on them. In particular, we have alerting rules on:</p><ul><li>HAProxy backend availability</li><li>High HTTP response latencies</li><li>High node resource usage</li><li>High rate of non-2xx responses</li><li>Failed Airflow jobs</li></ul><p>We check our Prometheus configs into version control. We do the same with Grafana dashboards. We load those from configuration files using Grafana's <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/" as="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/">provisioning</a> feature.</p></section></section><section><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we discussed how we use Docker Compose to run Splitgraph in production, as well as how to use it for automated deploys.</p><p>This is the final article in the series that talks about our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/topic/infrastructure">build, test and deploy infrastructure</a>.

Even the brightest idea with a whole load of value will slowly fade away if a wrong path is chosen. You have to plan strategies, measure performances, and check your direction. But most importantly—you have to focus.</p><p>Dave McClure presented the AARRR funnel, aiming to help new businesses narrow their focus. The model is still widely used and became a startup standard for over 13 years. In this article, we want to revisit AARRR and look at it from a different angle.</p></div><article id="AARRR-Framework-Definition"></article><div><h2>AARRR Framework Definition</h2><p>AARRR is a set of metrics used for understanding and optimizing users’ behavior. AARRR stands for acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue.</p><h3>Acquisition</h3><p>Acquisition focuses on the marketing channels you use to tell about the product.</p><p>Answers the question: Through what channels will people find out about the product?</p><p>Examples: SEO, ads, social media.</p><h3>Activation</h3><p>Activation focuses on the first actions you wish people to take when they encounter the product.</p><p>Answers the question: What percentage of the visitors falls into leads?</p><p>Examples: sign-up, booking a demo, downloading booklets.</p><h3>Retention</h3><p>Retention focuses on people coming back repeatedly and using the product.</p><p>Answers the question: What percentage of the leads falls into regular users?</p><p>Examples: web sessions, opening emails, returning to the blog.</p><h3>Referral</h3><p>Referral focuses on people spreading the word about the product.</p><p>Answers the question: Do users like the product enough to tell others?</p><p>Examples: sharing links, SM reposts, word of mouth.</p><h3>Revenue</h3><p>Revenue focuses on the money you make from turning leads into paying customers.</p><p>Answers the question: Do you successfully monetize these behaviors?</p><p>Examples: minimum revenue, break-even revenue, revenue exceeding CAC.</p><h3>AARRR Original Usage</h3><p>To apply AARRR to your product, you need to follow these steps. They are actionable, straightforward, and will help you focus on essentials without wasting time.</p><p>Step 1: Identify the AARRR metrics for your product.</p><p>Step 2: Set up tools for collecting the data.</p><p>Step 3: Analyze the data to understand what stages of user behavior must be improved.</p><p>Step 4: Think about how you improve them and plan further actions.</p></div><article id="why-prioritize-with-aarrr"></article><div><h2>Why Prioritize with AARRR</h2><p>It is critical to be able to analyze and understand users’ behavior. Your opinion is purely subjective. You can only imagine how people really react to your landing page or whether they find this or that feature convenient.</p><p>But presuming you’ve gathered the data and decided on one or two metrics you need to increase. How exactly are you going to pick the tasks from the backlog?</p><p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>It’s not a one-time action. Improving even a single metric is long, challenging, and requires commitment. If you need to level up retention, you want to be sure that every issue your team solves will positively impact retention. It’s a waste of time to do the tasks affecting acquisition if it’s not what you require right now. And this is when AARRR becomes your prioritization framework.</p></div><article id="Who-and-What-is-AARRR-Prioritization-for"></article><div><h2>Who and What is AARRR Prioritization for</h2><p>AARRR funnel can be used by both startups and big companies but with different approaches.</p><p>If you are small, use acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue as criteria through which you filter all your ideas and tasks. Create one evaluation board and monitor everything together. In startups, teams mostly do whatever they can so competition for time is high. The distinction between product and marketing blurs—you can activate or retain users with both content newsletters and product notifications. So you want to involve the whole team and decide which of the solutions will work best. AARRR is a powerful growth framework and it’s important to use it collaboratively at the early stages.</p><p>If you are big, you can still use AARRR but at a bigger scale—use each letter as separate evaluation boards. Even when you have dedicated cross-functional teams for each stage of the user behavior, they still need to prioritize their ideas. Create a board for each team in Ducalis and let them find the most valuable solutions inside their scope of influence. In this way:</p><ul role="list"><li>Each team will be able to set their own prioritization criteria that fit their objectives only.</li><li>Anyone in the company will be able to see the top priorities of all teams and sync on the bigger picture of the whole product.</li></ul></div><article id="1.-Transform-AARRR-Metrics-into-Scorecard-Criteria"></article><div><h2>How to Prioritize with AARRR</h2><p>AARRR is functional both as a stand-alone framework and as complementation. We started to prioritize with <a href="https://hello.ducalis.io/rice-score-why-its-no-good-and-you-use-it-wrong" target="_blank">the RICE score</a> but pretty soon added AARRR because RICE on its own isn’t enough.</p><h3>1. Transform AARRR Metrics into Scorecard Criteria</h3><p>Think of them as questions you will ask each time to understand what the feature or task influences. For instance:</p><ul role="list"><li>Acquisition—Will this solution increase the number of people we attract to the website/app?</li><li>Activation—Will this solution increase the number of people who register/install the app/book a demo?</li><li>Retention—Will this solution increase the number of people who regularly use the product?</li><li>Referral—Will this solution increase the number of people who are eager to tell others about the product?</li><li>Revenue—Will this solution increase the number of people who pay for product usage?</li></ul><p>These are generalized examples and we strongly recommend you to put more specific questions and additional description. But if you’re not sure yet how to match them to your product, these are great for a start. You can apply the AARRR template in Ducalis with the ready-made descriptions and use them as they are or customize.</p><figure id="w-node-559a6a8c500e-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f2ef4a7452e242cb7bdeb_GhrVKjWOyPySlxAaD9m1ENAstXP6t9B1gFNK9YKKLYqKLJLRNBU_ts7VlR4UY4xJdZcY9u5WU5cAdF1wRp_5-F2FrS6T2qooQf3CNNOxawmMltLK13_oIqsSllky5qo6fQBcM_8k.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Apply AARRR template in Ducalis with one click</figcaption></figure></div><article id="2.-Decide-on-What-You-Will-Prioritize"></article><div><h3>2. Decide on What You Will Prioritize</h3><p>Generally, AARRR is for measuring your marketing efforts. We also use AARRR for prioritizing feature development. You can use it for both, but you may need to divide the issues by the specificity and clarify the criteria descriptions. In Ducalis, we use two different boards for evaluating feature development tasks and marketing issues. Each of them has some adjusted AARRR criteria.</p><h4>Feature Prioritization</h4><p>For estimating feature ideas and product tasks we use Activation, Retention, and Revenue. In this case they have these descriptions:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Activation</strong>—Solves onboarding problems; Customer gets the value faster; Helps to understand how it works.</li><li><strong>Retention</strong>—Helps to sustain usage frequency. Evaluation must be regular. Helps teams to evaluate on time. It’s important to remind users how many issues they need to evaluate.</li><li><strong>Revenue</strong>—Helps to sell. Easier to make a demo. Customers understand the value. Customers don’t want to buy without it.</li></ul><p>Here we also have two criteria from RICE—Reach and Effort, and two criteria specific for our product—Speed and Collaboration. In Ducalis you can pick criteria from different framework templates and create your custom criteria.</p><figure id="w-node-9d020a5a32d5-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f2f6bab5d18573f5ce834_qJ8VW0rKqUVh4sIQu19s3xeR86x_ib6gpBVt5aKEbgoBfiomdcaeuYTsT0rNB_SEdMzTWCDcX-z1C8o9ySsWuNqTxKh8RPOk7VXJi_m1-s4Yeet5dfaER0K3M41DSUVQmKDnh39t.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>In Ducalis you can change criteria description or score scale to whatever you need</figcaption></figure><h4>Marketing Issues Prioritization</h4><p>For estimating marketing efforts we use two criteria from AARRR—Acquisition and Activation.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Acquisition</strong>—How much traffic to the landing page can we expect from the initiative?<br>0—No traffic. Task with another purpose.<br>1—&gt;100<br>2—100-500 <br>3—500-1000 and higher</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Activation</strong>—How many conversions can we expect from the initiative?<br>0—No conversions. Task with another purpose.&nbsp;<br>1—a few<br>2—about a dozen<br>3—dozens and more</li></ul><p>In this board, we use the RICE’s Effort and custom Analytics and Promotion Price criteria as well.</p><p>Content ideas we prioritize separately. <a href="https://hello.ducalis.io/how-to-prioritize-blog-content-ideas" target="_blank">Read this article</a> to find out how we do that.</p></div><article id="3.-Choosing-the-Focus"></article><div><h3>3. Choosing the Focus</h3><p>Focus is not about limitations or belittling perspectives. It is about the ability to control all the essential factors. If you want to scale, you have to break down all your ideas and tasks into five AARRR metrics and manage their improvements simultaneously. You can’t spend all your time enhancing retention only. You will end up with having nobody to retain because acquisition and activation weren’t working. At the same time, you can’t allow a substantial decline in one of the metrics and may require precise concentration. Growth means constant zooming in and out. It’s controlling everything while tackling subtleties.</p><p>For the most part, you want Acquisitions, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue to be of equal value and have the same weight. And then, when you see that one of them requires more team investments, you increase its weight. Thus tasks with more influence on that metric will skyrocket in the priority list.</p><p>You can play with weights in Ducalis and see how the list of your top priorities changes.</p><figure id="w-node-609620c699e5-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f2ff190fb19716e6bccbe_AARRR%20top%201.png" alt=""></p></figure></div><article id="4.-Highlight-the-Quick-Wins"></article><div><h3>4. Highlight the Quick Wins</h3><p>There is one vital point missing in AARRR—it doesn’t take into account the team’s efforts. Increasing your key metrics is important but you should never forget how much it will cost. Our budgets are not limitless and effort can be by far the most essential part of the prioritization process. To grow faster, you want to find quick wins. Add to the framework a restricting criterion to highlight the cheapest and most valuable solutions.</p><p>Add Effort to AARRR in Ducalis. Decide how you measure it (e.g., development complexity or promotion cost), and give it a negative weight (e.g., -2). You can add several restricting criteria with negative pull.</p></div><article id="5.-Choose-Scores"></article><div><h3>5. Choose Scores</h3><p>Finally, decide on numbers you are going to use for estimation. For example, you can use Fibonacci or Exponential sequences. We use the range from 0 to 3. The scores themselves are not that important as how you explain them. Adding what each score means to the criteria description helps to simplify the estimation, make it more solid and fast. We’ve added MoSCoW method to Ducalis AARRR template:</p><ul role="list"><li>0 - won’t impact</li><li>1 - can impact</li><li>2 - should impact</li><li>3 - must impact</li></ul><p>You can also use the exact numbers as you saw in the description of Acquisition and Activation in the 2nd point.</p><figure id="w-node-3b0f5e341c99-c3a2b62c"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e850a6cf7a82f6810bcb99b/5f1f3053fb956f5305b16fdf_NZLVjTyisOkhqXPIbHIWSp2IqCpIsDrLsDOS1CA-1BJAGjl1Y9J2rdveVV60FH1nJTUW_x2pN869Fh2hlGzX7WUH0igXKzq2FXASse7pKrttrePfRfmO6n9-1HYMHFbUCHIgHlgh.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>With criteria description and issue full context always at hand, evaluation is convenient and super fast</figcaption></figure></div><article id="6.-Find-Gaps-in-Team-Alignment"></article><div><h3>6.

Case in point: PhysFS.</p></header><p>Loading screens are pretty cool. They let artists showcase some nice art while the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_qehhZUds">intro theme song</a> starts playing. Used well, they can set up the stage for the eventual play by putting the player in the mood. But that’s only a side effect. Their main purpose is to keep the user busy while your game loads and initialize everything it needs to render the main menu, and possibly more. But after the first hundred or so starts, the experience may get old. Especially if that loading bar seems to be stuck forever.</p><p>Our Grand Strategy titles at Paradox have a reputation to not be on the fast side to load up, especially considering that they are not exactly next-gen graphics games with tens of gigabytes of assets. A couple months back, I decided to take a look at how Clausewitz (our internal engine) loads up stuff and what took so long.</p><p>The answer was interesting: most of the time was spent doing nothing. More precisely, either doing nothing by sleeping on a condition, or burning CPU cycles waiting a boolean to become <code>true</code>. We had a locking problem.</p><h2 id="thread-safe-but-not-thread-efficient">Thread safe, but not thread efficient</h2><p>The big lock contention was on file access. Every read, write, open, close or enumerate ended up locking a mutex or spin lock somewhere. And most of it was not even due to our engine.</p><p>To ease up filesystem access, we rely on a 3rd party library called <a href="https://icculus.org/physfs/">PhysicsFS</a>, or PhysFS. It’s a pretty handy way of mounting several directories and archives under the same logical hierarchy and treat it as one, handling things like priority when resolving names which is crucial to support DLCs and user mods properly. It also supports a variety of platforms and archive formats. But it had one fatal flaw: it’s bad at threading. Really bad.</p><p>Some time ago, my predecessors decided to load up the game data from disk with several concurrent threads. While it was probably efficient at the time, today it had become quite the pain, since PhysFS implements thread safety through <em>one</em> global mutex that is locked on all API calls. Meaning one thread doing a <code>read()</code> would block any other trying to either read, open, close or seek a file (be it the same or another one).</p><div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>stateLock</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>     <span>/* protects other PhysFS static state. */</span>

<span>int</span> <span>PHYSFS_close</span><span>(</span><span>PHYSFS_File</span> <span>*</span><span>_handle</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>FileHandle</span> <span>*</span><span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>FileHandle</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>_handle</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>rc</span><span>;</span>

    <span>__PHYSFS_platformGrabMutex</span><span>(</span><span>stateLock</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>PhysFS has been there for quite sometime, and at some point an issue was raised about the thread safety of the API, which was resolved by putting a global mutex or two. While probably good enough at the time, it turns out to be a serious performance killer on a modern machine with 8 cores trying to access the filesystem concurrently. In several cases it turned out to be even slower than processing the same data serially in one thread.</p><h2 id="improving-the-threading-model">Improving the threading model</h2><p>Luckily for me, it had been recently decided that we would embed a modified copy of PhysFS in our engine, which made it easier to tinker with it until I had something satisfactory. While I could probably make those changes public, they would have little chance of being accepted mainstream as is, as one of my first decision was to drop usage of C in favour of C++. Instead, I’ll describe here was I did to make our implementation more friendly to threads.</p><p>As I hinted, the first thing I did was to tweak the build (of course!) to have our local fork of PhysFS compiled by a C++ instead of a C compiler. Our engine is entirely built in C++ and there was little reason for me to keep dealing with C in 2020, especially if locks were involved. For example using macros and gotos instead of RAII to ensure proper unlocking on early returns is pure masochism if you ask me. See for yourself:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>#define GOTO(e, g) do { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_ERRPASS(g) do { goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF(c, e, g) do { if (c) { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); goto g; } } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF_ERRPASS(c, g) do { if (c) { goto g; } } while (0)
#define GOTO_MUTEX(e, m, g) do { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_MUTEX_ERRPASS(m, g) do { __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF_MUTEX(c, e, m, g) do { if (c) { if (e) PHYSFS_setErrorCode(e); __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } } while (0)
#define GOTO_IF_MUTEX_ERRPASS(c, m, g) do { if (c) { __PHYSFS_platformReleaseMutex(m); goto g; } } while (0)
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Once that was done, I was able to put all the API state (a few globals) inside a struct that would only be accessed through a RAII accessor that would lock/unlock on construction and destruction. Then I started checking if that state could be split into several sub-structures with each their locks. This allowed me to have a clearer understanding of the data model and where the contention was.</p><p>As it turned out, about 75% of the locking was done to ensure that the filesystem configuration was not changed during pathname resolution. As PhysFS aggregates several mount points under one root (like UNIX <code>mount</code> does), the API needed to lock the list of mount points to protect against data races should another thread mount or unmount a path at the same time.</p><p>The thing is, mounting or unmounting paths is a rare and specific operation. It is usually set up once when the game starts, and only change at very specific places (for example if the game allows to enable/disable mods on the fly). Almost 100% of the calls to <code>mount()</code> and <code>unmount()</code> are done while no other thread is loading as even with locks it would make the result unpredictable. Locking the whole API for that very rare case made no sense for us.</p><p>To solve this I introduced a <code>freeze_config()</code> call in the PhysFS API that would turn the configuration read-only internally. With proper use of <code>const</code> accessors, it allowed me to bypass locking entirely for read accesses to configuration while the freeze flag was set. Any non-const access to the configuration state in that mode would assert or throw an exception to trap the logic error. Since all access to the configuration singleton was now handled by a RAII accessor, it was easy to handle the change at one single point and have the whole PhysFS code behave like I wanted. This reduced the lock contention on FS access drastically, making threaded code actually run in parallel.</p><p>The next lock I got rid off was the error lock. PhysFS keeps track of errors by having a form of <code>errno</code> per thread which is stored inside a linked list of thread id / error code pairs:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>__PHYSFS_ERRSTATETYPE__</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>tid</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PHYSFS_ErrorCode</span> <span>code</span><span>;</span>
    <span>struct</span> <span>__PHYSFS_ERRSTATETYPE__</span> <span>*</span><span>next</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ErrState</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>ErrState</span> <span>*</span><span>errorStates</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>errorLock</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>     <span>/* protects error message list.        */</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>The API offers a way to get a description of the last error encountered on this thread. The canonical solution would have been the change the error reporting entirely, as keeping the last error code as internal state is considered bad form today (for good reasons), and instead ensure each API call would return an error code or exception when used. This would have, of course, required to change the whole API <em>and</em> all the callers.</p><p>Instead, I went for a quicker solution that made the last error code be a <code>thread_local</code> static variable inside PhysFS. This allowed me to get rid of most of the error code storage implementation, as there was no more need to handle a manually implemented linked list or lock anything. Unless the library is used in an environment where threads are really tight on thread local storage (which wasn’t my case), I found it to be a simple and elegant enough solution to the problem.</p><h2 id="a-lock-might-hide-another">A lock might hide another</h2><p>A surprise that came out of my new locking mechanism is that some lower bits of the library were not using any form of synchronization and simply relied on the main API lock to protect against data races. The archive file driver, for instance, shared a bunch of data meaning that two concurrent accesses to files in the same archive could result in a race condition.</p><p>Luckily, it turned out that access to those archive I/O handles were done a very few places so I could easily solve the issue by putting a lock at archive level. I would have searched for a more elegant solution if needed, but it turned that this one lock never showed up in the profiler, so I left it as is.</p><p>Still, that illustrated the fact that putting a global lock may lead to a bunch of unseen potential data races which will appear later once that lock is replaced by a more efficient mechanism, requiring changes in cascade throughout the implementation, down to the lowest levels.</p><p>The final lock I had to remove turned out to be on our side, as apparently someone had encountered an issue with PhysFS thread safety in the past on UNIX platforms and had added another spin lock on the call site of the API to address it. With the entire locking inside PhysFS now handled by <code>std::recursive_mutex</code> and <code>std::atomic</code> I could safely remove it.</p><h2 id="cascading-bottlenecks">Cascading bottlenecks</h2><p>As my readers may know, removing a bottleneck somewhere does not always solve the issue. Quite often, it only makes the next one visible. In my case, the biggest one to show itself after I was done was PhysFS was our asset loading system. Since PhysFS used to perform so poorly, there was little point trying to load some assets in parallel, especially back when our main renderer was DirectX 9.</p><p>Graphics API were historically also bad at threading. For example DirectX 9 isn’t thread safe by default, and the “thread-safe” flag just enables a big mutex, exactly like PhysFS does. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-differences">official documentation</a> recommends to not use it and instead do all API call on one thread. It’s one of the reason a lot of games still use a dedicated “rendering” thread to this date. While there are pros to this approach, the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>First of all, however, let’s look at the basics of log files, how to obtain them, and what challenges they present. </p><h2><b>What is a log file?</b></h2><p>A log file is a file output contained within a web server that records any request that the server receives. It is useful to investigate log files to see what resources are crawling a website.</p><p>Every time a user or a crawler visits a website, a bunch of recordings is entered into the log file. Log files exist for example for technical auditing, error handling and troubleshooting, but as many SEOs will tell you, they are also extremely useful as part of any thorough and in-depth SEO technical audit. A single page load enters a line for every resource request on that page. So depending on resource calls that is the amount of lines log gets. If browser cache is in use some resources might be loaded locally after initial load.</p><p>The reason behind this is because log files offer webmasters true records of how users, bots, and crawlers interact with a website. Suites such as Search Console and third-party software cannot provide entire or accurate pictures of the entities that interact with a website.</p><h2><b>Anatomy of a log file</b></h2><p>The structure and individual components of a log file depend on a variety of factors, including the type of server in question and other configurations.</p><p>There are, however, common factors found within log files. Typically, you will expect to see the following:</p><ul><li><p>Client/Visitor IP</p></li><li><p>Timestamp</p></li><li><p>Method (GET/POST)</p></li><li><p>Requested URL</p></li><li><p>HTTP status code</p></li><li><p>Browser user-agent</p></li></ul><p>(This is an example and the actual order of this structure may vary)</p><p>Other information that is generally, but not always available, include:</p><ul><li><p>Hostname</p></li><li><p>Request/Client IP</p></li><li><p>Bytes downloaded</p></li><li><p>Time taken to load the resource from server to client</p></li></ul><h2><b>
How can you get access to log files?</b></h2><p>How you access your log files depends entirely on how your server is set up.&nbsp;</p><p>These days one of the most common ways of getting access logs is getting them from a CDN provider. Like CloudFlare, CloudFront etc. You need to get the logs from the closest endpoint between the server/service serving your content/resources and client. In many cases that is the CDN. If CDN is in use, access logs from the webserver give nearly nothing as it gets hits only if the cache is purged.</p><p>On top, you have web servers. The three most common types of web servers are Apache, NGINX, IIS. Common CDN providers are for example Cloudflare, Sucuri, Kinsta CDN, Netlify CDN and Amazon CloudFront.</p><p>If you have never accessed your server files before, getting to them can be difficult. You will also need to know what type of log you are searching for, such as an error log or an access log.&nbsp;</p><p>Providing detailed explanations of how to access these for each type of server is an article for another day, but below are three official guides to accessing log files on the three different server types:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to access Apache access log files </a>(Linux)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to access NGINX </a><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access </a><a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">log files</a> (Linux)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to access IIS </a><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access </a><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">log files</a> (Windows)</p></li></ul><h2><b>What are the challenges in getting the log files?</b></h2><p>Since obtaining server files is a cumbersome task, for those with a lack of experience or technical knowledge, getting them can be excruciatingly difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides this, however, there are also several other reasons that a person may find it challenging to get log files.</p><p>For instance, IIS servers are often used by legacy systems, which can be the case for when larger companies have long-running server contracts with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that webmasters who inherit legacy systems may need to refresh their knowledge of older software.</p><p>Another issue, if you are working with a client, is that the client may not understand or appreciate the importance of log files, which means that they could be hesitant to provide access or to obtain them themselves. Or they might've just simply disabled the logs as unnecessary, which means there is no historical data.</p><p>And logging needs to be enabled.</p><p>Quite often, SEOs will have to go through a myriad of departments or stakeholders to obtain or access more technical information or data.</p><p>These complications can often make log file analysis more difficult and frustrating for SEOs, despite the issues having little or nothing to do with the investigation itself.</p><p>I wanted to explore some of the challenges SEOs faced in obtaining log files, so I asked the Twitter SEO community for their experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s fair to say that the Tweet blew up and I had so many great SEOs respond. Both Giana’s and Lyndon’s tweets pretty much sum up the problems around getting hold of log files.
</p><p>Here is a summary of other issues raised.</p><p><b>1. PII</b> <b>(Personally identifiable information)</b> - PII seems like a big enough concern for many organizations, and it's easy to see why. Recent changes to GDPR and compliance means that businesses are reluctant to deal with anything remotely PII. But log files don’t always carry PII, and it's easy to strip out this information from the logs. So, with the right education, it's possible to convince the development and various stakeholders by highlighting the benefits of using log files.&nbsp;</p><p>A potential solution to this problem is to strip out any non-bot IP addresses as mentioned by Serge. I will show you how to do this easily using BigQuery.</p><p>Charly suggested another interesting point about using GET requests. But, it’s important to remember that Google does use POST requests.</p><u>
</u>
Thomas gave a solid tip about compliance and PII as well.<p><b>2. The format/structure of the logs</b> - The logs come in many different formats/data structures and some use compression to save space. So, when you’re using a tool to do the analysis, software often requires logs to be in a certain structure and charset. This is a pain point and not easy to resolve when we are talking about large file sizes.</p><p>I will show you how to solve this problem (or at least try), further in this article.&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Log size and storage</b> - This seems like the biggest problem faced by SEOs according to the thread. Numerous people mentioned this.</p><b></b><p><b>4. Convincing clients/companies to allow access to the logfiles</b> - Obtaining access to files is a common problem I’ve noticed across the clients that I have personally worked with, and it takes a lot of effort to convince them that this is worth doing, so I totally agree with some of the comments here.&nbsp;</p><p><b>5. Platform limitations</b> - Some platforms allow easy access to server logs. However, the majority of the platforms have little or no interest in providing access to logs as it rarely is in their scope. In large companies, there are multiple CRMs and accompanying systems; not all the log analyzing tools support every type of platform. </p><p>You can also sometimes overcome these through "Edge SEO", Tag Manager or CDN Workers. Also, access logs are NOT and NEVER will be a platform problem. Nor a CRM. Always is a web server/CDN problem, which is platform agnostic.</p><p>This comment from Chris resonated with me because this entire article is based on this problem I had.&nbsp;</p><p><b>6. Accuracy of the data</b> - Accuracy is not an actual problem. It's there, you just need to have the ability to shift through the noise.</p><p>Even Though this might be a problem for some. But, Doing reverse DNS check on mass is not that difficult and can be completely automated.</p><p>Simon made some incredible points as well. According to his observations, Googlebot is used to do Google shopping validation, and if this is accurate (I believe him), the accuracy of the actual bot visit cannot be determined.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there are no official sources on this it's easy to see why it's a very valid point.</p><p><b>7. CDN</b> - Most websites utilize CDN networks for speed and security. It can be a problem for log collection as assets can be served from different CDNs. Also as I mentioned previously the access logs need to be gathered from the "closest endpoint to the visitor" which is in many cases the CDN. With several pipelines, it is wise to have a normalized stream of logs merged into a single place for analyzing.</p><h2><b>
Why log file analysis is important for SEO?</b></h2><p>There are several benefits for conducting a log file analysis for SEO, and it can provide you with a greater overall picture of how your website is performing and interacting with other entities on the internet.</p><p>For instance, by conducting a thorough and in-depth analysis, you can discover whether your crawl budget is spent efficiently, whether crawlers encounter deadends and bottlenecks, and if there are areas of crawl deficiency.</p><p>From the information gathered from the analysis, you can make the necessary improvements to your site, enabling it to perform better in organic search.</p><h2><b>What are some SEO use cases?</b></h2><p>Let’s take a more in-depth look to see how a log file analysis can be used. This list is not exhaustive, but these are some of the more common use cases for SEOs.</p><ul><li><p>Manage crawl budget</p></li><li><p>Fix status code errors</p></li><li><p>Verify whether your site has switched to the Mobile-First Index</p></li><li><p>Prioritize your crawl</p></li><li><p>Manage your crawl frequency</p></li></ul><h3><b>Analyze crawl budget</b></h3><p>Not to be confused with crawl rate, crawl budget is an established term for the number of pages that a bot is able to crawl across a period of time — which usually stands as a single day.&nbsp;</p><p>The budget applied to a website can depend on many factors, but largely it will depend on the website’s frequency of publishing new and/or updating old content and ease of crawl.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important, therefore, that your crawl budget is spent on the right pages. For instance, if the bot gets bored and leaves your site after around 2,000 pages, you do not want that budget spent on unnecessary areas of your website, such as internal scripts or redirected pages.</p><p>Although crawling is usually controlled through robots.txt files and meta-robots tags, there could still be gaps in your defences that let crawlers through to redundant pages.</p><p>Thankfully, log files will tell you which pages are crawled by search engine bots. If you’re unsure about a particular page, ask yourself whether Google or users will find anything useful from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you find pages that you want to omit …</p></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian. Left: folder pane; middle: raw markdown; right: Rendered note</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a new desktop app for creating a "A second brain, for you, forever.". It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

July 28, 2020 | https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/speeding-up-static-websites-with-pjax/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/speeding-up-static-websites-with-pjax/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the fast-growing trend of static websites, many people are moving their blogs from <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, etc, to static websites built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. And there is a good reason for that. One of the reasons is security, cutting down server costs, ease of maintenance, performances, and many others. But in this article, I would like to focus on performances.</p>
<p>As everybody knows, static websites offer out-of-the-box very fast performances without any configuration. You have no database, no dynamically generated content, just serving HTML files from your hosting. As simple as that. But using the PJAX technique we can improve loading performances and enhance the user’s experience a lot!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pjax-and-how-it-works">What is PJAX and how it works?</h2>
<p>PJAX technique is using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState">PushState</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a>. Basically, on a page request, we will manually update the URL and inject the new content on the page, thus avoiding reloading your page’s layout or any resources (JS, CSS), giving a fast page load.</p>
<p>Here are the steps of the process with <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the link is valid and eligible for PJAX. If yes, prevent normal browser behavior.</li>
<li>Change the URL using the push state API.</li>
<li>Start fetching the new page via an XMLHttpRequest.</li>
<li>Create a new transition instance.</li>
<li>As soon the new page is loaded, barba.js parses the new HTML (taking .barba-container) and puts the new content on the DOM inside #barba-wrapper.</li>
<li>The transition instance will take care of hiding the old container and showing the new one.</li>
<li>As soon as the transition is finished, the old container is removed from the DOM.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-implement-pjax-on-a-website">How to implement PJAX on a website?</h2>
<p>There are many PJAX libraries, like <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a>, <a href="https://sennajs.com/">Senna.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MoOx/pjax">Pjax</a>, etc. Usually, they all offer extremely easy implementation, I prefer using Barba.js for simple websites and Senna.js for more complex ones as it has a better API. In this article, I will use Barba.js</p>
<p>The implementation consists of 2 parts:
Setting up DOM markup
Script initialization.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-dom-markup">Setting up DOM markup</h3>
<p>Barba.js needs to know how your website is set up, so it will need a few HTML attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>body</span> <span>data-barba</span><span>=</span><span>"wrapper"</span>&gt;
  <span>&lt;!-- put here content that will not change
</span><span>  between your pages, like &lt;header&gt; or &lt;nav&gt; --&gt;</span>

  &lt;<span>main</span> <span>data-barba</span><span>=</span><span>"container"</span>&gt;
    <span>&lt;!-- put here the content you wish to change
</span><span>    between your pages, like your main content &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt; --&gt;</span>
  &lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;

  <span>&lt;!-- put here content that will not change
</span><span>  between your pages, like &lt;footer&gt; --&gt;</span>
&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The wrapper is the main Barba section that contains all your page structure and the Barba container.
The container defines a section in which content is updated automatically when you navigate between your pages.</p>
<h3 id="script-initialization">Script initialization</h3>
<p>After setting up the DOM attributes we simply include Barba.js script in the head of the document and initialize the script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"text/javascript"</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@barba/core"</span> <span>async</span> <span>onload</span><span>=</span><span>"barba.init({})"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach will give a SPA-like feeling of the website since there are much fewer server requests.</p>

                <p><span>The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a growing threat to biodiversity. This trade is becoming one of the most valuable illegal trade sectors. IWT threatens biodiversity and can have a negative impact on the economy. Hiding or laundering IWT revenues undermines financial integrity. Financial criminals facilitate money laundering activities by making billions of dollars of illegal trade in rhino horns, ivory, and other similar wildlife products.</span></p><p><span>  It has published a global report on IWT for the first time by assessing the aspects of money laundering (ML) of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) wildlife crimes and how judicial districts should apply FATF standards to combat IWT. </span></p><h2><b>Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) Relationship With Money Laundering </b></h2><p>   <span>FATF released the June 2020 Money Laundering and the Illegal Wildlife Trade report. The purpose of the <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Money-laundering-and-illegal-wildlife-trade.pdf">FATF report</a> is to provide guidance on measures that can be taken to combat money laundering from the Illegal Wildlife Trade. The Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a major organized crime that fuels corruption and threatens biodiversity. According to the 2016 UN World Wildlife Crime report, criminals trade products derived from more than 7,000 wild animal and plant species worldwide. Criminals illegally trade not only iconic mammals but also less well-known species such as bird, amphibian species, corals, reptiles, boney fish. A striking example is illegally hunting criminals to make bags and shoes from the skin of pythons, to consume them as food, and to be used as a traditional medical tool.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FATF defines illegal wildlife trade as a "global threat", which is also linked to other organized crime such as drug trafficking and arms trade. Criminals abuse the official financial industry to hide illegal revenues from wildlife crimes and money laundering. According to the report, an estimated 7 billion to 23 billion dollars of illegal wildlife trade takes place annually. Although making a profit from illegal wildlife trade is one of the most effective ways of money laundering, there is a deficiency in monitoring the financial flows of wildlife smugglers, this means that countries rarely focused on the financial aspect of this crime. Therefore, the criminals continued to expand their activities in this area.</span><span><br></span></p><h2><b>Methods Used for The Illegal Wildlife Trade  </b></h2><p>   <span>All criminals in IWT often use shells and front companies to hide payments and launder the revenues of their illegal activities. They primarily use shell companies to facilitate the transfer of value among the union members of the criminals, between buyers and sellers, or to hold assets. In addition, criminals often use legitimate frontline companies to hide the transfer of value from IWT. On the other hand, criminals use the import-export industries to legally demonstrate the movement of goods and payments across borders. Some of the vulnerable sectors that criminals use to clear your income are breeding facilities, pet shops, zoos, the decor, and the fashion industry. </span></p><p><span>Simply to explain their process, Illegal funds obtained are transferred to third parties via bank transfers through e-banking platforms, loans or payments, licensed money transfer systems, and banks. Third-party accounts also often use innocent bank mules. Their illegal transactions are not noticeable, and thus money laundering takes place. Furthermore, with the development of online markets and mobile, social media-based payments, The Illegal Wildlife Trading has increased.</span><span> </span></p><h2><b>Cooperation in Financial Crimes Related to The Illegal Wildlife Trade </b></h2><p> <span>According to the FATF Recommendation, all jurisdictions require that Illegal Wildlife Trade identify, assess, and take action to reduce the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, As stated in the FATF report, if criminal offenses related to money laundering caused by Illegal Wildlife Trade abroad occurred in another country, this should definitely constitute a crime. As a result, wildlife crime committed abroad as a basis for money laundering should not only be able to provide international cooperation in cases where double criminality is required but also through domestic investigations and prosecutions. </span></p><p><span> On the other side, Cooperation between the public and private sectors is important for the identification and disruption of IWT related financial flows. Especially in jurisdictions with public-private partnerships, there has been an interaction between the public sector and financial institutions in the monitoring of crimes related to IWT. Collaborations include both strategic and operational information exchange. As a result of the survey conducted by FATF, most of the countries' cooperation in combating IWT-related financial crimes is realized within the financial sector and to a lesser extent among non-financial sectors. </span></p><h2><b>FATF Recommendations in Combating IWT </b></h2><p>   <span>To combat money laundering (ML) and Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT), both high-level political commitment and improved operational cooperation are needed. It is very important to work closely with sectors that play a role in combating money laundering with law enforcement officers responsible for wildlife crime. Studies can improve countries and private sector activities. The role of FATF Standards is very important in combating illegal wildlife trade. </span></p><p><span>   Understanding of IWT's threats to non-financial businesses, different geographic country risk profiles for different species, and asset management practices related to illegal wildlife trade are required. FATF encourages strengthening money laundering risk understandings related to such crimes through comprehensive risk assessments and sharing the results of these efforts with all relevant authorities.  </span><span> </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><br></p>

July 28, 2020 | https://amitness.com/2020/07/checklist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/2020/07/checklist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>When developing an NLP model, it’s a standard practice to test how well a model generalizes to unseen examples by evaluating it on a held-out dataset. Suppose we reach our target performance metric of 95% on a held-out dataset and thus deploy the model to production based on this single metric.</p>
<p>But, when real users start using it, the story could be completely different than what our 95% performance metric was saying. Our model might perform poorly even on simple variations of the training text.</p>
<p>In contrast, the field of software engineering uses a suite of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to evaluate all aspects of the product for failures. An application is deployed to production only after passing these rigorous tests.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-software-testing.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118">Ribeiro et al.</a> noticed this gap and took inspiration from software engineering to propose an evaluation methodology for NLP called <strong>“CheckList”</strong>. Their paper won the best overall paper award at ACL 2020.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain the overall concept of CheckList and the various components that it proposes for evaluating NLP models.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-testing">Behavioral Testing</h2>
<p>To understand CheckList, let’s first understand behavioral testing in the context of software engineering.</p>
<p>Behavioral testing, also known as black-box testing, is a method where we test a piece of software based on its expected input and output. We don’t need access to the actual implementation details.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have a function that adds two numbers together.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can evaluate this function by writing tests to compare it’s output to the expected answer. We are not concerned with how this function was implemented internally.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>test_add</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>3</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Even for a simple function such as addition, there are capabilities that it should satisfy. For example, the addition of a number with zero should yield the original number itself.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Function Signature</th>
<th>Output</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Test Passed</th>

<td><span>4</span>/<span>4</span> = <span>100%</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="checklist-framework">CheckList Framework</h2>
<p>CheckList proposes a general framework for writing behavioral tests for any NLP model and task.</p>
<p>The core idea is based on a conceptual matrix that is composed of <span>linguistic capabilities</span> as rows and <span>test types</span> as columns. The intersecting cells contain multiple test examples generated from templates that we run and calculate the <span>failure rate</span> for.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span>Capability</span> / <span>Test</span></th>
<th><span>Minimum Functionality Test(MFT)</span></th>
<th><span>Invariance Test(INV)</span></th>
<th><span>Directional Expectation Test(DIR)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>VOCABULARY</span></td>
<td><span>15.0%</span></td>
<td><span>16.2%</span></td>
<td><span>34.6%</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>NER</span></td>
<td><span>0.0%</span></td>
<td><span>20.8%</span></td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>NEGATION</span></td>
<td><span>76.4%</span></td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>…</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By calculating the failure rates for various test types and capabilities, we can know exactly where our model is weak.</p>
<p>Let’s understand each part of this conceptual matrix in detail now.</p>
<h3 id="1-test-types">1. Test Types</h3>
<p>These are the columns in the previous matrix. There are 3 types of tests proposed in the CheckList framework:</p>
<h4 id="a-minimum-functionality-testmft">a. Minimum Functionality Test(MFT)</h4>
<p>This test is similar to unit tests in software engineering. We create a collection of (text, expected label) pairs and test the model on this collection.</p>
<p>For example, we are testing the negation capability of the model using an MFT test below.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-mft.png" alt=""><br>
Template: I <span>{NEGATION}</span> <span>{POS_VERB}</span> the <span>{THING}</span></p>
<p>The goal of this test is to make sure the model is not taking any shortcuts and possesses linguistic capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="b-invariance-testinv">b. Invariance Test(INV)</h4>
<p>In this test, we perturb the text examples in a way that the label should not change. Then, the model is tested on this perturbed example and the model passes the test only if its prediction remains the same (i.e invariant).</p>
<p>For example, changing the location from Chicago to Dallas should not change the original sentiment of a text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-INV.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can use different perturbation functions to test different capabilities. The paper mentions two examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Perturbation</th>
<th>Invariance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>Change location name in text</td>
<td>Should not change sentiment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robustness</td>
<td>Add typos to the text</td>
<td>Should not change prediction</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="c-directional-expectation-testdir">c. Directional Expectation Test(DIR)</h4>
<p>This test is similar to the invariance test but here we expect the model prediction to change after perturbation.</p>
<p>For example, if we add a text “You are lame” to the end of a text, the expectation is that sentiment of the original text will not move towards a positive direction.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/checklist-DIR.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can also write tests where we expect the target label to change. For example, consider the QQP task where we need to detect if two questions are duplicates or not.</p>
<p>If we have a pair of duplicate questions and we change the location in one of the questions, then we expect the model to predict that they are not duplicates.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Predicted</th>
<th>Passed</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>How many people are there in <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>What is the population of <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>Duplicate</td>
<td>Duplicate</td>
<td>✔</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NER</td>
<td>How many people are there in <span>England</span>?</td>
<td>What is the population of <span>Turkey</span>?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td><span>Duplicate</span></td>
<td><span>X</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="2-linguistic-capabilities">2. Linguistic Capabilities</h3>
<p>These are the rows in the CheckList matrix. Each row contains a specific linguistic capability that applies to most NLP tasks.</p>
<p>Let’s understand examples of capabilities given in the original paper. The authors provide a lot of examples to help us build a mental model of how to test new capabilities relevant to our task and domain.</p>
<h4 id="a-vocabulary-and-pos">a. Vocabulary and POS</h4>
<p>We want to ensure the model has enough vocabulary knowledge and can differentiate words with a different part of speech and how it impacts the task at hand.</p>
<p>For example, the paper shows the 3 test types for a sentiment analysis task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>The company is Australian</td>
<td>neutral</td>
<td>neutral adjective and nouns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>That cabin crew is <span>extraordinary</span></td>
<td>positive</td>
<td>sentiment-laden adjectives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td><span><del>the</del></span> ⮕ <span>our</span> nightmare continues</td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Replace neutral words with other neutral words</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>AA45… JFK to LAS. <span>You are brilliant</span></td>
<td>move towards +ve</td>
<td>Add positive phrase to end</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DIR</td>
<td>your service sucks. <span>You are lame</span></td>
<td>move towards -ve</td>
<td>Add negative phrase to end</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This can also be applied for the QQP task as shown below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MFT</td>
<td>Is John a teacher?</td>
<td>Is John <span>an accredited</span> teacher?</td>
<td>Not Duplicate</td>
<td>Modifiers change question intent</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="b-named-entity-recognitionner">b. Named Entity Recognition(NER)</h4>
<p>It tests the capability of the model to understand named entities and whether it is important for the current task or not.</p>
<p>We have examples of NER capability tests for sentiment analysis given below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test Type</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Expected</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td>We had a safe travel to <span><del>Chicago</del></span> ⮕ <span>Dallas</span></td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Switching locations should not change predictions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INV</td>
<td><span><del>Benjamin</del></span> ⮕ <span>Anna</span> was your savior</td>
<td>no change</td>
<td>Switching person names should not change predictions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can also apply this to the QQP task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<th>Question 1</th>
<th>Question 2</th>

<td>Keep first word and entities, replace everything else with ROBERTA</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="c-temporal">c. Temporal</h4>
<p>Here we want to test if the model understands the order of events in the text.</p>
<p>Below are examples of tests we can devise to evaluate this capability for a sentiment model.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="d-negation">d. Negation</h4>
<p>This ensures the model understands negation and its impact on the output.</p>

<p>Example of image cartoonization with our method: left is a frame in the animation "Garden of words", right is a real-world photo processed by our proposed method.</p>

<p>
		This paper presents an approach for image cartooniza- tion. By observing the cartoon painting behavior and consulting artists, we propose to separately identify three white-box representations from images: the surface rep- resentation that contains a smooth surface of cartoon im- ages, the structure representation that refers to the sparse color-blocks and flatten global content in the celluloid style workflow, and the texture representation that reflects high- frequency texture, contours, and details in cartoon im- ages. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework is used to learn the extracted representations and to car- toonize images.
		<br>
		The learning objectives of our method are separately based on each extracted representations, making our frame- work controllable and adjustable. This enables our ap- proach to meet artists’ requirements in different styles and diverse use cases. Qualitative comparisons and quanti- tative analyses, as well as user studies, have been con- ducted to validate the effectiveness of this approach, and our method outperforms previous methods in all compar- isons. Finally, the ablation study demonstrates the influence of each component in our framework.

<p>In this process, cash flows through a number of systems described in detail below.</p>
<p>Accountants perform cash reconciliations to ensure that cash has appropriately gone through these systems for each transaction.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatisaaidcashreconciliationcashreconciliationa">What Is a <a id="cashreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation</a>?</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the completeness of a sale or transaction across the company’s financial systems. Its completion provides assurance for both cash and revenue balances.</p>
<p>Multiple financial systems are involved in a cash reconciliation and generally, cash balances across these systems do not match.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/cash-reconciliation-example.png" alt="cash-reconciliation-example"></p>
<p>We’ll explore cash reconciliations further below, but first we’d like to address a common misconception.</p>
<h5 id="cashreconciliationvsbankreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation vs. Bank Reconciliation</h5>
<p>Cash reconciliations are often misunderstood to be the same thing as bank reconciliations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation">bank reconciliation</a> is the process of matching transaction amounts reported in a bank statement with those recorded in the general ledger. Its purpose is to ensure that the cash balance recorded in the general ledger aligns with the entity’s actual cash balance in the company’s bank account. While companies and banks record the same transactions, the time at which a company records cash in the general ledger often differs from the time at which their bank reports the associated change.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="systemsinvolvedinacashreconciliation">Systems Involved in a Cash Reconciliation</h2>
<p>A cash reconciliation is more complex and comprehensive than a bank reconciliation because it involves a company's entire financial technology stack. Below are the four most common systems involved in a cash reconciliation. They can vary depending on company size, business model, or technological maturity.</p>
<h5 id="billingsystem">Billing System:</h5>
<p>A billing system creates and manages customer invoices that allow customers to pay for their purchases. Cash from billing systems represent how much cash is expected to be collected from sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Aria, Chargebee, Recurly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="paymentprocessor">Payment Processor:</h5>
<p>A payment processor relays customers’ payment information to a company’s bank and the customers’ banks in order to complete a transaction. It verifies payment legitimacy and provides instructions to banks for fund transfers. Cash from payment processors represent the final cash received by the company’s bank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stripe, Adyen, Braintree/PayPal, WorldPay</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="companysbank">Company’s Bank:</h5>
<p>A company’s bank collects and deposits the cash from transactions that are successfully processed by payment processors. It is the final system involved in a cash reconciliation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="revenuerecognitionsystem">Revenue Recognition System:</h5>
<p>A revenue recognition system calculates revenue for the current period and liabilities for future deferred revenues. It ingests information from both billing systems and payment processors to perform these calculations according to the company’s arrangements and policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Leapfin, NetSuite ARM, Zuora RevPro</li>
</ul>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Generally, the cash balances across these systems <em>do not match</em>, which is precisely why accounting teams need to perform cash reconciliations.</p>
<p>Common reasons for mismatch across these financial systems include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currency differences (Transaction currency, local exchange currency, payout currency)</li>
<li>Foreign exchange translations (How an international company translates foreign subsidiary earnings into its reporting currency)</li>
<li>Timing differences (Deposits in transit, time zones, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest way to examine the relationship between cash, revenue, and deferred revenue is to understand the deferred revenue roll forward. A deferred revenue roll forward is a simple calculation that ensures incoming and outgoing activities to the deferred revenue balance are properly accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/deferred-revenue-rollforward-1.png" alt="deferred-revenue-rollforward-1"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First, let’s review deferred revenue itself.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue is a cash payment from a customer for goods or services to be provided in the future. Since the seller’s obligation has not been filled, the cash has not been earned, and the seller records this as a liability on the Balance Sheet via a deferred revenue balance. Deferred revenue is especially common among subscription and SaaS companies, in which payments are made upfront in exchange for service periods in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: On Jan 1, 2020 a customer makes a $120 purchase for a subscription service spanning Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Jan 1</td><td>Cash</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td></td><td>$120</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As the seller completes its obligations over time to earn the revenue, the deferred revenue balance on the Balance Sheet is reduced accordingly by the amount of revenue earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The seller recognizes revenue monthly based on the service period of Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. $120 across 12 months results in revenue of $10 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 28</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>March 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And so forth for April 30, May 31, etc...</p>
<p>At month 12 on Dec 31, 2020, the deferred revenue balance will be fully exhausted as the $120 cash payment would be fully recognized.</p>
<p>Check out our previous blog post on <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/revenue-cash-reconciliation-for-subscription-businesses/">Revenue Cash Accounting for Subscription Businesses</a> for more detailed journal entries.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="cashisimportanttodeferredrevenue">Cash is Important to Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Since cash is an important part of the deferred revenue calculation, cash balance figures must be accurate for deferred revenue to be reliable. Accounting teams can be confident in their revenue figures by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performing cash reconciliations to verify that cash activity in the period is accurate</li>
<li>Comparing the deferred revenue roll forward calculation and deferred revenue balance in the general ledger.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the beginning deferred revenue, cash, and ending deferred revenue balances have been substantiated, then there is reasonable assurance that revenue for the period is also correct.</p>
<p>It may seem simple in this example, but calculating deferred revenue can be quite complicated. Because revenue is derived from sales in both the current and prior periods, companies with high volume of transactions and/or multiple product lines may experience additional difficulty calculating deferred revenue.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/issues/10">some of the statistics</a> we are going to study for this year’s Web Almanac we may end up needing a list of CSS shorthands and their longhands. Now this is typically done by <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">maintaining a data structure by hand</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">guessing based on property name structure</a>. But I knew that if we were going to do it by hand, it’s very easy to miss a few of the less popular ones, and the naming rule where shorthands are a prefix of their longhands <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0155.html">has failed to get standardized</a> and now has even more exceptions than it used to. And even if we do an incredibly thorough job, next year the data structure will be inaccurate, because CSS and its implementations evolve fast. The browser knows what the shorthands are, surely we should be able to get the information from it  …right? Then we could use it directly if this is a client-side library, or in the case of the Almanac, where code needs to be fast because it will run on millions of websites, paste the precomputed result into whatever script we run.</p>



<p>There are essentially two steps for this:</p>



<ol><li>Get a list of all CSS properties</li><li>Figure out how to test if a given property is a shorthand and how to get its longhands if so.</li></ol>



<p>I decided to tell this story in the inverse order. In my exploration, I first focused on figuring out shorthands (2), because I had coded getting a list of properties many times before, but since (1) is useful in its own right (and probably in more use cases), I felt it makes more sense to examine that first.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I’m using <code>document.body</code> instead of a dummy element in these examples, because I like to experiment in <code>about:blank</code>, and it’s just there and because this way you can just copy stuff to the console and try it wherever, even right here while reading this post. However, if you use this as part of code that runs on a real website, it goes without saying that you should create and test things on a dummy element instead!</em></p>



<h2>Getting a list of all CSS properties from the browser</h2>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, this is as simple as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(document.body.style)</code>. However, in Firefox, this doesn’t work. Why is that? To understand this (and how to work around it), we need to dig a bit deeper.</p>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, <code>element.style</code> is a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration">CSSStyleDeclaration</a></code> instance. In Firefox however, it is a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">CSS2Properties</a></code> instance, which inherits from <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties"><code>CSS2Properties</code></a> is an older interface, defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">the DOM 2 Specification</a>, which is now obsolete. In the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-cssstyledeclaration-interface">current relevant specification</a>, <code>CSS2Properties</code> is gone, and has been merged with <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. However, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290786">Firefox hasn’t caught up yet</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox on the left, Safari on the right. Chrome behaves like Safari.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the properties are on <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>, they are not own properties of <code>element.style</code>, so <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code> fails to return them. However, we can extract the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> instance by using <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto">__proto__</a></code> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf">Object.getPrototypeOf()</a>, and then <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body.style))</code> gives us what we want! </p>



<p>So we can combine the two to get a list of properties regardless of browser:</p>



<pre><code>let properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(
	style.hasOwnProperty("background")? 
	style : style.__proto__
);</code></pre>



<p>And then, we just drop non-properties, and de-camelCase:</p>



<pre><code>properties = properties.filter(p =&gt; style[p] === "") // drop functions etc
	.map(prop =&gt; { // de-camelCase
		prop = prop.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function($0) { return '-' + $0.toLowerCase() });

		if (prop.indexOf("webkit-") &gt; -1) {
			prop = "-" + prop;
		}

		return prop;
	});</code></pre>



<p>You can see a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/eYJodjb?editors=0010">codepen with the result here</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Testing if a property is a shorthand and getting a list of longhands</h2>



<p>The main things to note are:</p>



<ul><li>When you set a shorthand on an element’s inline style, you are essentially setting all its longhands.</li><li><code>element.style</code> is actually array-like, with numerical properties and <code>.length</code> that gives you the number of properties set on it. This means you can use the spread operator on it:</li></ul>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.background = "red";
&gt; [...document.body.style] 
&lt; [
	"background-image", 
	"background-position-x", 
	"background-position-y", 
	"background-size", 
	"background-repeat-x", 
	"background-repeat-y", 
	"background-attachment", 
	"background-origin", 
	"background-clip", 
	"background-color"
]</code></pre>



<p>Interestingly, <code>document.body.style.cssText</code> serializes to <code>background: red</code> and not all the longhands.</p>



<p>There is one exception: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">The <code>all</code> property</a>. In Chrome, it does not quite behave as a shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.all = "inherit";
&gt; [...document.body.style]
&lt; ["all"]</code></pre>



<p>Whereas in Safari and Firefox, it actually returns every single property <em>that is not a shorthand</em>!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox and Safari expand <code>all</code> to literally all non-shorthand properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is interesting from a trivia point of view, it doesn’t actually matter for our use case, since we don’t typically care about <code>all</code> when constructing a list of shorthands, and if we do we can always add or remove it manually.</p>



<p>So, to recap, we can easily get the longhands of a given shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>function getLonghands(property) {
	let style = document.body.style;
	style[property] = "inherit"; // a value that works in every property
	let ret = [...style];
	style.cssText = ""; // clean up
	return ret;
}</code></pre>



<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>



<p>You can see how all the pieces fit together (and the output!) in <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOPEJxz?editors=0010">this codepen</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>How many of these shorthands did you already know? </p>

<li>We went from a materially scarce society to a materially abundant one; and</li>
<li>from an informationally scarce society to an informationally abundant one.</li>
<li>The challenge of this decade is attention scarcity. Many of the day-to-day used tools and content in social spaces are actively misaligned, and operating on the basis of soaking up attention for monetization. And because the financial engine underlying this is <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/out-to-get-you/" target="_blank">unbounded</a> (unlike people's honest effort, which is not), on a sufficiently long timespan (such as where we are circa ~2020), this engine eats up everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>To unpack the problem a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"…Tools and tricks that casinos and psychologists and others have used for decades, have been sharpened and personalised and put in your pocket leashes around your brain to tug at you and -yeah I know how dramatic that sounds but nonetheless- it is the explicit goal of many of these systems." "it’s easy to point at the worst of them but.. What’s on my mind a lot is I’m almost more worried about what they’ve done to the whole landscape of attention around them because they’ve become so good at capturing your attention. They’ve upped an evolutionary competition from everything else in the world.</em></li>
<li><em>Everything that survives on human attention all entertainment and media has to evolve better ways at capturing that attention or risk starvation or replacement by a more fit species. The intent is not malicious it’s just blind evolution, which is far more concerning because there’s almost nothing that can be done.</em></li>
<li><em>You’re trying to walk a narrow path through a jungle full of things calling to you and with competition comes specialization: even if you know how to avoid the top predators something less obviously dangerous may get you. The tension traps don’t have to be flashy and fast: some work better with a kind of repetitive dullness because they hook into your mind exactly, or symbiotic species form a little loop that you just circle endlessly going from one to the other to another and back again.</em></li>
<li><em>I worry this is creating an attentionally deficit society that you constantly have a brain tugged at and pulled at is to end up with a brain so used to having its time and attention captured and consumed that even if you step away briefly you’re left with a mind unable to be on its own to be idle to reflect.”</em> Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf2VxeIm1no" target="_blank">CPG Grey: Walk with me</a></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>gwern: "Underuse of System II particularly manifests as over-exploitation/under-exploration, where large potential improvements are foregone because of a lack of a habit or other systematic factor which would trigger exploration. [..] One way to measure under-exploration is noting instances where exogenous randomization or destruction of the status quo option leads to permanent changes or net efficiency gains after the shock is removed, indicating learning or that the status quo was suboptimal all along."</li>
<li>Like with drugs, the issue with these platforms is that they make you feel okay with being bored; while boredom is a trigger for needing to do something more; and these platforms, like a sponge, soak up that extra energy, and redirect it towards hate.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Taxonomy of attention problems:</h2>

<p>Software scaffolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>youtube &amp; wall/feeds selecting for content which maximizes the "engagement" / amount of time you're spending there; at extremes, this happens by driving people to more extremist content, but the algo tends to find it's way around attention barriers</li>
<li>software scaffolds optimizing for drama-maximization. Worst offender here used to be Tumblr, which allowed people to pick-quote specific parts from an overall article, without backlinks, or context present. This created a strong evolutionary pressure for the most anger-inducing pieces to spread, which could then further mutate, and become a super-germ</li>
<li>To a lesser extent, Twitter does the same</li>
</ul>

<p>Culture scaffolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>controversy igniting thought-germs evolution. "If there is some argument that splits the population, and lasts forever, you're looking at a super-successful pair of symbiotic anger germs, that have reached ecological stability" (CGP Grey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc</a> ) . This is known as the "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731210923/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/" target="_blank">toxoplasma of rage</a>".</li>
<li>people taking offense &amp; offense taking being rewarded, which feeds more anxiety in target group: people "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23640135" target="_blank">sit around looking to be offended to raise their own social value amonst their online peers</a>."</li>
<li>These things can happen naturally, but more often than not are deliberately led by a "lapidation entrepreneur" : <em>"&nbsp;Someone makes a mistake, or a foolish or offensive comment, and lapidators come out in force, often in a state of frenzy. Usually they are led by lapidation entrepreneurs, who have their own agenda. They might be concerned with self-promotion. They might be concerned with promoting a cause or with defeating an opponent, for whom the lapidation victim is taken to stand, or can be made to stand. They may want to make the occasion for lapidation stand for the opponent, so that the opponent, or the cause for which they stand, is that occasion." </em> [ <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3407390" target="_blank">Lapidation and Apology by Cass R. Sunstein</a> ]</li>
</ul>



<h2>Solutions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The general meta-problem with any short-term hacks, is the strong incentive for the memes, and the agents in the system to hack around any published solutions, and so they aren't <a href="https://sdrinf.com/reflection-completeness" target="_blank">reflection-complete</a>: the more people know about them, the less they work. Solutions below therefore fall into categories of: either non-scaleable, hard to reach, or have an incentive that is more aligned with the user</li>
<li>For gathering data on how aligned your infospace is with your own values,&nbsp;KPIs:</li>
<li>"<em>A key metric of mental health is how many of your thoughts are new thoughts (sentences you haven't spoken inside your mind before) vs old thoughts (words that have run through your mind many times).</em>" (by EY)</li>
<li>a good qualitative exercise, is to regularly ask yourself how a piece of content makes you feel. If your first intuitive feeling is anger, you might just be looking at a particularly fit piece of toxoplasma.&nbsp;</li>
<li>a good quantitative exercise is taking snapshots of your monitor every 30 seconds (autoscreen) for a day, or two, then reviewing where you're spending your time on, and deciding whether you're okay with such allocation of your time</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Things which currently work: small communities, where there is a barrier of entry, for enduring connections (iterative, infinite game, as opposed to transient one-shots prominent on large social networks); reputational capital, and knowing eachother for a long periods of time</li>
<li>A leverage point in avoiding toxoplasma, is the bridge people: people who are being rewarded for taking offense, and therefore select for the worst possible behavior of the outgroup. These people act as <em>stressors</em>, specifically triggering ideations of worst-case-scenarios. The fix here is removing these people from your feeds/circles of influence.</li>
<li>participating in non-US communities. There are two angles here: the business models of many US corps can't be made economical in non-US territories, and therefore they don't target these; and for US-specific culture pieces, anything which does show up goes through the great filter of geography -had to be deemed useful enough for other countries to include it in their communities.</li>
<li>Self-hosted systems for anything valuable. Dropbox -&gt; owncloud, filters below</li>
<li>filters, filters everywhere</li>
<li>One of the most promising solution is coming from MIT media labs: <a href="https://gobo.social/" target="_blank">https://gobo.social/</a> which allows you to (transparently) filter your twitter / facebook feeds based on preferences. Imperfect, but directionally correct</li>
<li>For Twitter, I wrote my own filter which uses ML magic to classify individual tweets according to pre-labelled tags.</li>
<li>Software filters, a lot of them. Specifically:</li>
<li>Against advertisement (ublock origin, and it's many extensions)</li>
<li>Against being enrolled into targeting systems (again, ublock to filter out client-side JS tech)</li>
<li>Tampermonkey for overriding site's defaults (eg opting out from dark design patterns)</li>
<li>Site-specific filters: HN keyword filter, reddit enhancement suite, fluffbusting purity</li>
<li>For specific keyword list, see eg <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfNoPolitics/wiki/filters" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfNoPolitics/wiki/filters</a></li>
<li>Mental filters, selecting for reliable/useful information sources:</li>
<li>The best source on this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU" target="_blank">Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information</a> , highly recommended</li>
<li>When evaluating a site/social account:</li>
<li>Who is behind this information? Friends/person/company? &amp; Why are they sharing it? What are the incentives in that content being read?</li>
<li>What is the evidence for their claims? Is it backed up with evidence? Is that evidence from a reliable source?</li>
<li>search for opposite -is there any evidence *against* it?</li>
<li>Lateral reading: Lateral reading: you have to leave the site to understand the site. Read content side-by-side with what others have to say about it. What do other sources say about the organization and its claims?</li>
<li>[ref:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZsaA0w_0z0&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU" target="_blank">The Facts about Fact Checking</a>&nbsp;@ CC]</li>
<li>Being very selective for the communities I participate in. At the very basic level, still-working communities have either very strong moderation, some barrier of entry (payment, knowing about the community in the first place, initial onboarding interview), or more likely all of the above</li>
<li>Aggressively filtering out people who take offense, replicate the toxoplasma of rage, or are otherwise being animated by memes. Specific exercise for this: open fb feed, read until you find a thing which does not improves your life, click on owner (author / group) -click “friend” -&gt; unfollow. Iterate until sanity is restored.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, a bit of activism, which when scaled up to large number of people can actually correct for some of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For persons, the constructive way to nudge into proper behavior is sending them a friendly pm on how to make the conversations more productive: <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening" target="_blank">https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening</a></li>
<li>Corporations sending messages specifically to you are subject to the CAN-SPAM act, and can be …</li></ul></section></article></div>

</ul>

<h3><a id="intro">What is NihAV?</a></h3>
<p><code>NihAV</code> is an experimental multimedia framework aiming at several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing a test bed for developing decoders for various formats, preferably not yet reverse engineered;</li>
<li>trying new approaches for conventional multimedia concepts (hence the project name);</li>
<li>making it possible to build some useful tools like a player or transcoder;</li>
<li>…and in a process of doing that obtaining and refining knowledge about multimedia formats and related algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, <code>NihAV</code> is a research framework and its goals do not include either being the fastest, covering all possible formats, or world domination.</p>
<p>Additionally that means that <code>NihAV</code> code is written with emphasis on being clear and more self-containing i.e. avoiding tricks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SWAR</a> where possible, duplicating code if it helps clarity, and not bundling similar functions into one module if they are not very related and used by different codecs from different families (e.g. vector functions from speech codecs). On the other hand if it makes to factor out some common code (e.g. for all H.263-based decoders) it is done in the most codec-agnostic way with clear interface between decoders and common decoding framework and no codec-specific hacks inside that framework.</p>

<h3><a id="why">Why NihAV and not something else?</a></h3>
<p>It should be obvious from the goals that <code>NihAV</code> has different priorities from other frameworks and built on different principles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are no frameworks I could use as a base as they are either too simple and limited (like <code>libquicktime</code>) or too complex and convoluted that cutting it down and de-mangling is more tedious than writing a new framework from scratch (no points for guessing which one I'm talking about). The same is true to some extent for <code>tcvp</code> (it even used its own build system) and it's hard to locate nowadays. (Side note: <code>rust-av</code> had not existed at that time either).</p>
<p>Back in 2015 I stared to work on future <code>NihAV</code> design and even wrote some code (which was discarded later) but that attempt did not last for long since I lost interest in doing anything.</p>
<p>In 2017 I decided to try Rust to see what this language has to offer and the best way to do that is to write a complex project so I restarted <code>NihAV</code> and three years later it has main features implemented along with the support for a significant amount of codecs, some of them were reverse engineered specially for <code>NihAV</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="parts">What parts NihAV comprise?</a></h3>
<p>As a framework <code>NihAV</code> consists of the following crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nihav-core</code> — a core crate containing common interfaces (frame data, codecs, de/muxers and such) plus common utility code like audio and image format conversion or decompression methods support;</li>
<li><code>nihav-codec-support</code> — a crate with auxiliary code useful for developing codecs (testing functionality, DSP, common code for H.263-based decoders and such) and not much else;</li>
<li><code>nihav-commonfmt</code> — a crate with decoders and demuxers for various common formats;</li>
<li><code>nihav-registry</code> — an auxiliary crate with code to detect common container formats, lists of fourccs and codec descriptions;</li>
<li><code>nihav-duck</code>, <code>nihav-game</code>, <code>nihav-indeo</code>, <code>nihav-ms</code>, <code>nihav-qt</code>, <code>nihav-rad</code> and <code>nihav-realmedia</code> — crates with decoders (and demuxers if needed) for a family of formats;</li>
<li><code>nihav-allstuff</code> — a crate that allows registering en/decoders and (de)muxers from the crates mentioned above in single place.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proper architecture overview will be done in another page later.</p>
<p>Additionally there are some tools written mostly to test or demonstrate functionality of the framework. There's <code>nihav-tool</code> for decoding audio and video streams and dumping decoded results into wave file and sequence of images correspondingly. There's <code>nihav-encoder</code> for transcoding media into different format (currently there's just two audio and two video encoders and single AVI muxer, so it serves more like a test bed for those encoders and a working prototype). And there's <code>nihav-player</code>, a buggy and very limited player that is useful only for watching samples to see if they are decoded properly. I plan to write a proper player that has at least basic features like pausing or seeking (or proper sync) but I cannot tell when this will happen.</p>

<h3><a id="use">How can I use it?</a></h3>
<p>As you know there are four software freedoms for a program user as formulated by Richard Stallman:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to demand from the programmer to modify program for your needs, and not compensating for the time and efforts it takes (freedom 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think there's an off-by-one error you may be right. RMS has not mentioned the last freedom in the list but nowadays it seems to be the most important one. In theory developers and project are paid in exposure (unless it's a large corporation not willing to admit using your software in public) but since I do not care about that and it's my side project for which I can't dedicate too much time to deal with feature requests or bug reports.</p>
<p>In result <code>NihAV</code> is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GNU AGPL</a> in order to be not so popular and provided as is without any warranty or promise of user support. Nevertheless, if you find some part of it useful I'll be happy to re-license it for you under any other free license (LGPLv2+, MIT, WTFPL, whatever—as long as it does not make new obligations for me) and other people can use it afterwards from your repository while <code>NihAV</code> still remains under AGPL. Manual re-licensing is done just to prevent abusing the system (like “can't you give all of the code under N-clause BSD?”—you're not <code>rust-av</code> as it is the only project to which I can allow that; or in the unlikely case when some project first takes my code and then badmouths it—why should I help it after that?).</p>
<p>For similar reasons the code is hosted at some obscure place instead of GitHub.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the main purpose of <code>NihAV</code> for other people should be providing bits of code of varying usefulness and demonstrating that any idiot can write a complex feature-rich multimedia framework with possible application in real world. I did it after all.</p>

<h3><a id="next">What's next?</a></h3>
<p>I do not like to make plans since they tend to go wrong. Instead of that I prefer to pick whatever I'd prefer to do at random and do that. Here is what I want to do eventually:</p>
<ul>
<li>as I mentioned above, write a player that supports basic features like playing several files in sequence, playing audio-only files, pausing and seeking;</li>
<li>supporting some common lossless formats so I can use it to play most of the music I have (luckily I have not so many MP3s so I can ignore it);</li>
<li>maybe write a limited H.264 decoder (because RV¾, SVQ3 and VP7 were not enough) so I can use the player to watch most of the videos too (even if it's limited to baseline and maybe only 8-bit videos it still does not sound like a pleasant task though);</li>
<li>keep exploring encoding concepts and play with them like trellis encoding or rate distortion; maybe I can write an encoder for VP6 since there is some interest in <em>Red Alert</em> modding community;</li>
<li>reverse engineer some game format or some old exotic codec.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different roads and usually one thing leads to another thing so I cannot predict how <code>NihAV</code> will be developed but I expect it to stay as useless as it is now.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>

      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world

Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ES2020 has been out for a while. I guess a lot of <code>Node</code> developers have already adopted these features. Some even started using them when these features were still under proposal stages. Yep. My team started using some stage 3 features for quite a while.</p><p>In this article, I'm going to talk about my feelings of using these ES2020 features. As a result, I think those features are great and essential.</p><p>Contents:</p><ul><li><a href="#1-operator-nullish-coalescing">1.

Operator: Nullish Coalescing</a></h2><p>At the beginning, my idea of "providing exlicit explanation of your code" denies such improvement. I think since a value of <code>nullish</code> or <code>falsy</code> should be given a thorough "explanation" under an <code>if condition</code> or some other strategic <code>function</code>. In this way, I could also add some extra logics without refactoring the shorthand expression later.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> website <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>'https://pitayan.com'</span>

  url <span>=</span> website<span>.</span><span>url</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>But I made compromise quickly after trying "nullish coalescing" everywhere in the project. My concern was proved unnecessary. Because what I want is to make sure the target variable has concrete value in most of the scenarios.</p><p>In Typescript, operating a <code>nullish</code> value will probably be given errors or warnings. This means my code can be optimized easily by following the expostulation.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> url<span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> website<span>.</span>url <span>??</span> <span>'https://pitayan.com'</span></code></pre><p>In brief, my feeling toward <code>nullish coalescing</code> is quite supportive. It' going to be very helpful while assigning non-nullable value to a variable.</p><h2 id="2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import"><a href="#2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import">2. Asychronous Modules: Dynamic import</a></h2><p>I've been using this feature since stage 2. You know, our apps needs that ability of "Just in Time".</p><p>It helps me import Javascript / JSON files as modules in my application. And now it can just show up anywhere in my project (mostly for front end. Haven't experience it on server side). Have to say this feature is indispensible.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> answer <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./myanswer.json'</span><span>)</span>

I never hope that I can't eat breakfast without washing my face.</p><p>Of course, I can add <code>finally</code> to the <code>Promise</code> chain to make sure eating breakfast. But <code>finally</code> doesn't provide the correct context I wanted. Don't even have to mention using <code>catch</code> to eat breakfast, that's a bad practice.</p><p>Finally, <code>allSettled</code> permits us to set a callback whenever I wash my face or brush my teeth. I just want that breakfast! It feels like you grew up and move out of parents' home. So mom's scolding about washing face and brushing teeth are gone.</p><pre><code>

It is indeed a rare case to use <code>BitInt</code> at the moment in my project. I believe there are other general demands around this features in other projects.</p><p>A simple example I can come up with is: If a database's model ID is numberic and fairly long (like a shopping order ID), then when it is passed onto the frontend the <code>BigInt</code> can come into help.</p><h2 id="5-regex-stringprototypematchall"><a href="#5-regex-stringprototypematchall">5. Regex: String.prototype.matchAll</a></h2><p>Actually <code>matchAll</code> has been proposed for a long time. It returns an <code>Array</code> containing all matched characters. Compared to <code>match</code>, the return type <code>RegExpStringIterator</code> gives us a consistant result whenever the string matches or not. By using tools like <code>Array.from</code> I could finally pull all results from the <code>iterator</code>.</p><p>This after all is a good improvement in my humble opinion.

A Standardized Global Object: GlobalThis</a></h2><p>Sometimes the JS code needs to cross platform, but Node.js uses <code>global</code> which is different to browser's <code>window</code> (web worker uses <code>self</code>).

<p>In this post, we will experiment and observe how keeping
the important regions of an image and masking the rest affects the accuracy of
several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks.</p>

<h2 id="important-pixels-and-where-to-find-them">Important pixels and where to find them</h2>

<p>Explainability in machine learning is an increasingly popular topic - understanding
why certain predictions were made is necessary for humans to trust machine learning models
and deploy them in real-life scenarios.
Several methods have been proposed already, like LIME <a href="#lime">(Ribeiro et al., 2016)</a>
 and KernelSHAP <a href="#NIPS2017_7062">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017)</a>, which
allow us to understand which parts of an input was important
for a particular prediction by assigning attribution scores to feature values. These
are model-agnostic methods, meaning that they do not assume anything about the
target model’s architecture or parameters (they are treated as black boxes).</p>

<p>Today we will look at a model-specific method, in particular, Integrated Gradients
<a href="#sundararajan2017axiomatic">(Sundararajan et al., 2017)</a>.
This method is focused on neural networks as it relies on being able to evaluate the gradients
of the model’s output with respect to the input. The goal of Integrated Gradients is to
figure out which pixels in an image contributed most to the neural network’s prediction.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_examples.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 1. Example outputs of Integrated Gradients. The attributions are sharper
compared to simply taking the gradients (source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">arxiv</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So how does Integrated Gradients work? The method involves taking the
input image, the neural network, and some baseline image
(e.g. a black image or random noise) to observe how the model’s prediction changes as we
linearly interpolate between the baseline and input images. In particular, we measure the
gradients at each interval of a linear path between the input and the baseline, then summing
the gradients to find the final attributions per pixel. More formally, Integrated Gradients
are calculated as follows:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation*}

IntegratedGradients_i(x) = \frac{x_i - b_i}{m} \sum_{h=1}^m
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}( b + \frac{h}{m}(x-b) )

\end{equation*}\]

</p><p>This equation finds the attribution value of each pixel $i$ in the input image $x$.
$b$ represents the baseline image, and $m$ is the number of steps between $x$ and $b$,
so $b + \frac{h}{m}(x-b)$ is the interpolation between $x$ and $b$ at step $h$ out of $m$.
We then get the gradient of the model output $f$ at pixel $x_i$ for this interpolated input
($\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$). Finally we evaluate the weighted sum of the gradients at each
interpolation step $h$ to find the Integrated Gradients attribution for each pixel.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_intuition.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 2. An illustration of what Integrated Gradients does.
We start from two points in the image space, the input image and some baseline,
and we calculate the gradients of the network at each point along the way. Summing all
the gradients gives us the Integrated Gradients attributions. Kudos to
<a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/marco-spinaci">Marco Spinaci</a> for sharing the graphic!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Integrated Gradients supports several axioms which are desirable for gradient attribution
methods. While we won’t discuss these in detail, here’s a very brief summary of each:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: if two inputs differ by one pixel and get different predictions, then
that pixel should get a non-zero attribution score.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation invariance</strong>: if two models have the same outputs for every input, then
Integrated Gradients should produce the same attributions for both models, even if they
are implemented differently.</li>
  <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: the attribution scores computed by Integrated Gradients should sum to
the difference between the prediction of the input image and that of the baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do checkout their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">paper</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ankurtaly/Integrated-Gradients/blob/master/icml_slides.pdf">slides</a>
for more details! We will now move onto the experiments.</p>

<h2 id="masking-out-unimportant-parts">Masking out unimportant parts</h2>

<p>Here are the steps we take to mask out an image using integrated gradients:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inputs: an image, a model, cut off percentage $p$</li>
  <li>Apply Integrated Gradients on the image</li>
  <li>Create “components” but summing the attribution scores of 3x3 squares</li>
  <li>Select the top $p \%$ of 3x3 squares based on total attribution scores</li>
  <li>Set pixels not in top $p \%$ of components (i.e. the unimportant parts) to zero</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s important to note that, taking the top 50% of gradient attributions does not mean
taking 50% of all pixels. We rely on the PyTorch implementation found
<a href="https://github.com/TianhongDai/integrated-gradient-pytorch">here</a>
for computing Integrated Gradients attributions. We apply this procedure to all
validation images in ImageNet to create a masked dataset. For $p$, we choose a range
of values (90, 70, 50, and 30).</p>

<p>Here are some example images:</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://seansaito.github.io/images/masked-accuracy/ig_grid_1.png" alt="ig_0" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
  <figcaption>Fig 3. Example images of the masked dataset.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most images are still recognisable when $p=90$ or $p=70$, whereas the objects are
no longer identifiable when $p=30$.</p>

<p>We compare several pre-trained models from PyTorch’s <code>torchvision.models</code> module
(<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">documentation</a>). For these
experiments, we will just compare the top-1 accuracies of each model on the masked datasets.</p>

</figure>

<p>Accuracy deteriorates as $p$ decreases, and at $p=30$ the models are only
slightly better than random guessing. What’s surprising is that, even when we keep the
top 90% of gradient attributions and their respective pixels,
the models’ accuracies drop significantly (more than half for VGG-16!).
The results suggest that these convolutional neural networks require the entirety of
the image in order to reach state-of-the-art accuracy, even if we keep the most important
features.</p>

<p>This got me thinking of another experiment to further test this hypothesis -
what if we deliberately mask out the important regions of an image and test the models’
accuracies? So instead of keep the top 90% of gradient attributions, we keep the bottom
10%. Such a dataset would look like this:</p>

  <figcaption>Fig 4. Instead of keeping the top $p$% of gradients, we mask out the corresponding
pixels.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The lower $p$ is, the more visible the images are as we hide fewer pixels.
Here are the accuracies of each model:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>As expected, accuracy increases as we decrease $p$. However, when you compare these
results to the first table, something weird is apparent. Take a look at $p=50$.
For the VGG-16 model, when we keep the <em>top</em> 50% of attributions, we get
an accuracy of 0.91%, whereas when we keep the <em>bottom</em> 50% worth of attributions,
we instead get 16.06%! Just to check, I compared images which keep the top 50% of
gradient attributions to images that keep the bottom 50%. One would assume that the
top 50% of gradient attributions and corresponding pixels would yield better visual
clues. Well, here’s the comparison:</p>

<figure>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Top 50% of gradient attributions</th>
      <th>Bottom 50% of gradient attributions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

  <figcaption>Fig 5. A comparison of images keeping the top 50% and images
keeping the bottom 50% of gradient attributions</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For some images, keeping the top 50% of gradient attributions indeed carves out
the object itself (e.g. the medieval ship off the coast in the third image from
the left). But it does appear that, for some images, keeping the top 50% removes
too much context to the point where it’s even difficult for a human to identify the objects.
What do you think? As mentioned earlier, taking the top 50% of gradient attributions does not mean
taking 50% of all pixels. Therefore for some images, the top 50% of gradient attributions
may correspond to a smaller proportion of pixels.</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-thoughts">Summary and thoughts</h2>

<p>In this article, we explored Integrated Gradients, a popular way to generate
gradient-based attributions for each pixel, and use it to create datasets where we
mask out important or unimportant regions of pixels. We then experimented with several
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and measured their accuracies on these
datasets. Interestingly, even when keeping the top 90% of gradient attributions and their
corresponding pixels, the top-1 accuracies of these models drop significantly.
Perhaps even more surprising is that keeping
the bottom 50% of gradient attributions gave <em>higher</em> accuracy than keeping the
top 50%.</p>

<p>What conclusions can be made out of these experiments? It’s probably safe to say that
state-of-the-art neural networks require the entirety of the input image in order to
reach high performance. But these results have in fact raised more questions for me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do the bottom half of gradient attributions yield higher accuracy than images
taking the top half?</li>
  <li>What if we train a model from scratch using one of these masked datasets? Or mix
regular images with these masked images? Would this improve model robustness?</li>
  <li>Is there (or should there exist)
some correlation between $p$ and overall accuracy of the model? E.g. if I keep
the top 90% of gradient attributions should I expect at least 90% of the original
accuracy?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions would likely lead to separate investigations for the future. Do reach out
if you have questions, any ideas about the above questions, or want to collaborate!

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>

<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg"><img src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" alt="" width="533" height="142" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled.jpeg 780w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-300x80.jpeg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-chip-disabled-768x205.jpeg 768w"></a></p>
<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

                      └─sysinit.target @874ms
                        └─<a href="https://austingwalters.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9fece6ecebfaf2fbb2fdfefcf4f3f6f8f7ebdffdfefcf4f3f6f8f7eb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:amdgpu_bl0.service @2.609s +12ms

                              └─-.slice @177ms</pre>
<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service. Although, it should be noted this could cause your system to fail to boot, if the network daemons require internet connection (highly unadvised to use such systems on a …</p></div></article></div>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first.

pure numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Most blocked resources:</strong> USA Today (46)</li><li><strong>Least blocked resources:</strong> BBC News (9) and The New York Times (9)</li><li><strong>Average over 15 websites:</strong> 23 Resources Blocked</li></ul><p>However, if you’re looking for an answer as to which one is the safest to read your news – I guess it would BBC or NYT <em>based on the numbers alone</em>. A lot of people have their favourites and many simply don’t trust certain news platforms so in the end the decision is on you. Treat this only as a fair warning, or something which you should pay attention to.</p><p>I guess the real question isn’t which one is safe, it’s rather where is it safe. If you’re sure your browser is blocking enough of it, you don’t have much to worry about. You have very less chances of finding a website that does 0 tracking – so you should be equipped to protect yourself from those that do. If you’re an Android user, consider reading the news using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch">Snap Search 😁</a></p><p>Please remember this was completely out of curiosity while testing the latest version of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap Search</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>&nbsp; I want to examine together with you various types of sort algorithms and the tricks they use to lower the magic O number. I reach the conclusion that high performance algorithms that are labeled as specific to a certain type of data can be made generic or that the generic algorithms aren't really that generic either. I end up proposing a new form of function that can be fed to a sorting function in order to reach better performance than the classic O(n*log(n)). Extra bonus: finding distinct values in a list.</p> <h2>Sorting</h2> <p>&nbsp; But first, what is sorting? Given a list of items that can be compared to one another as lower or higher, return the list in the order from lowest to highest. Since an item can be any type of data record, to define a generic sorting algorithm we need to feed it the rules that make an item lower than another and that is called the comparison function. Let's try an example in Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>  // random function from start to end inclusive
  function rand(start, end) {
    return parseInt(start + Math.random() * (end - start + 1));
  }
  
  // measure time taken by an action and output it in console
  let perfKey = 0;
  function calcPerf(action) {
    const key = perfKey++;
    performance.mark('start_' + key);
    action();
    performance.mark('end_' + key);
    const measure = performance.measure('measure_' + key, 'start_' + key, 'end_' + key);
    console.log('Action took ' + measure.duration);
  }
  
  // change this based on how powerful the computer is
  const size = 10000000;
  // the input is a list of size 'size' containing random values from 1 to 50000
  const input = [];
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    input.push(rand(1, 50000));
  
  // a comparison function between two items a and b
  function comparisonFunction(a, b) {
    if (a &gt; b)
      return 1;
    if (a &lt; b)
      return -1;
    return 0;
  }
  
  const output = [];
  // copy input into output, then sort it using the comparison function
  // same copying method will be used for future code
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
      output.push(input[i]);
    output.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; It's not the crispest code in the world, but it's simple to understand:</p> <ul><li>calcPerf is computing the time it takes for an action to take and logs it to the console</li> <li>start by creating a big array of random numbers as input</li> <li>the array in a result array and sorting it with the default sort function, to which we give the comparison function</li> <li>display the time it took for the operation.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; This takes about 4500 milliseconds on my computer.</p> <p>&nbsp; Focus on the comparison function. It takes two items and returns a number that is -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the first item is smaller, equal or larger than the second. Now let's consider the sorting algorithm itself. How does it work?</p> <p>&nbsp; A naive way to do it would be to find the smallest item in the list, move it to the first position in the array, then continue the process with the rest of the array. This would have a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). If you don't know what the O complexity is, don't worry, it just provides an easy to spell approximation of how the amount of work would increase with the number of items in the input. In this case, 10 million records, squared, would lead to 100 trillion operations! That's not good.</p> <p>&nbsp; Other algorithms are much better, bringing the complexity to O(n*log(n)), so assuming base 10, around 70 million operations. But how do they improve on this? Surely in order to sort all items you must compare them to each other. The explanation is that if a&lt;b and b&lt;c you do not need to compare a to c. And each algorithm tries to get to this in a different way.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, the basic logic of sorting remains the same: compare all items with a subset of the other items.</p> <h2>Partitioning</h2> <p>&nbsp; A very common and recommended sorting algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="sometimes called partition-exchange sort, Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.">QuickSort</a>. I am not going to go through the entire history of sorting algorithms and what they do, you can check that out yourself, but I can focus on the important innovation that QuickSort added: partitioning. The first step in the algorithm is to choose a value out of the list of items, which the algorithm hopes it's as close as possible to the median value and is called a pivot, then arrange the items in two partitions: the ones smaller than the pivot and the ones larger than the pivot. Then it proceeds on doing the same to each partition until the partitions are small enough to be sorted by some other sort algorithm, like insertion sort (used by Chrome by default).</p> <p>&nbsp; Let's try to do this manually in our code, just the very first run of the step, to see if it improves the execution time. Lucky for us, we know that the median is around 25000, as the input we generated contains random numbers from 1 to 50000. So let's copy the values from input into two output arrays, then sort each of them. The sorted result would be reading from the first array, then from the second!</p>  <pre><code>  // two output arrays, one for numbers below 25000, the other for the rest
  const output1 = [];
  const output2 = [];
  const pivot = 25000;
  
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      const val = input[i];
      if (comparisonFunction(val, pivot) &lt; 0)
        output1.push(val);
      else
        output2.push(val);
    }
    // sorting smaller arrays is cheaper
    output1.sort(comparisonFunction);
    output2.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; Now, the performance is slightly better. If we do this several times, the time taken would get even lower. The partitioning of the array by an operation that is essentially O(n) (we just go once through the entire input array) reduces the comparisons that will be made in each partition. If we would use the naive sorting, partitioning would reduce n<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>to n+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(once for each partitioned half), thus n+n<sup>2</sup>/2. Each partitioning almost halves the number of operations!</p> <p>&nbsp; So, how many times can we half the number of operations for? Imagine that we do this with an array of distinct values, from 1 to 10 million. In the end, we would get to partitions of just one element and that means we did a log<sub>2</sub>(n) number of operations and for each we added one n (the partitioning operation). That means that the total number of operations is... n*log(n). Each algorithm gets to this in a different way, but at the core of it there is some sort of partitioning, that b value that makes comparing a and c unnecessary.</p> <p>&nbsp; Note that we treated the sort algorithm as "generic", meaning we fed it a comparison function between any two items, as if we didn't know how to compare numbers. That means we could have used any type of data as long as we knew the rule for comparison between items.</p> <p>&nbsp; There are other types of sorting algorithms that only work on specific types of data, though. Some of them claim a complexity of O(n)! But before we get to them, let's make a short detour.</p> <h3>Distinct values</h3> <p>&nbsp; Another useful operation with lists of items is finding the list of distinct items. From [1,2,2,3] we want to get [1,2,3]. To do this, we often use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure.">trie</a>, a tree-like data structure that is used for quickly finding if a value exists or not in a list. It's the thing used for autocorrect or finding a word in a dictionary. It has an O(log n) complexity in checking if an item exists. So in a list of 10 million items, it would take maybe 20 operations to find the item exists or not. That's amazing! You can see that what it does is partition the list down to the item level.</p> <p>&nbsp; Unfortunately, this only works for numbers and strings and such primitive values. If we want to make it generic, we need to use a function that determines when two items are equal and then we use it to compare to all the other items we found as distinct so far. That makes using a trie impossible.</p> <p>&nbsp; Let me give you an example: we take [1,1,2,3,3,4,5] and we use an externally provided equality function:</p> <ul><li>create an empty output of distinct items</li> <li>take first item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (none)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to output</li> <li>take next item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (1)</li> <li>item is found, so we do nothing</li> <li>...</li> <li>we take the last item (5) and compare with existing items (1,2,3,4)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to the output</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; The number of operations that must be taken is the number of total items multiplied by the average number of distinct items. That means that for a list of already distinct values, the complexity if O(n<sup>2</sup>). Not good! It increases exponentially with the number of items. And we cannot use a trie unless we have some function that would provide us with a distinctive primitive value for an item. So instead of an equality function, a hashing function that would return a number or maybe a string.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, given the knowledge we have so far, we can reduce the complexity of finding distinct items to O(n*log(n))! It's as simple as sorting the items, then going through the list and sending to output an item when different from the one before. One little problem here: we need a comparison function for sorting, not an equality one.</p> <h2>So far</h2> <p>&nbsp; We looked into the basic operations of sorting and finding distinct values. To be generic, one has to be provided with a comparison function, the other with an equality function. However, if we would have a comparison function available, finding distinct generic items would become significantly less complex by using sorting. Sorting is better than exponential comparison because it uses partitioning as an optimization trick.</p> <h2>Breaking the n*log(n) barrier</h2> <p>&nbsp; As I said above, there are algorithms that claim a much better performance than n*log(n). One of them is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.">RadixSort</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstsort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="cache-efficient algorithms for sorting strings. They are variants of the traditional radix sort but faster for large data sets of common strings, first published in 2003, with some optimizing versions published in later years.">BurstSort</a> is a version of it, optimized for strings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.">CountSort</a> is a similar algorithm, as well. The only problem with Radix type algorithms is that they only work on numbers or recursively on series of numbers. How do they do that? Well, since we know we have numbers to sort, we can use math to partition the lot …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | A task takes an e and measures performance.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> { measure <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> p } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Profunctor</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

And also at that time we started hearing that other hospitals, in Ireland and Denmark, have also noticed the drop down in the number of preemies."</p>  <p>When Calgary doctors took a good look at the numbers and compared them to the same time last year, it was an eyeopener.</p>  <p>"We were surprised," Alshaikh said.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h3>What is the Blueprint?</h3>

<p>The Draft Blueprint ("the Blueprint") is the "first draft" of Plan Bay Area 2050, integrating 25 resilient and equitable strategies from the predecessor <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/horizon">Horizon initiative</a>. The Blueprint is a critical step in the Plan Bay Area 2050 process as the region strives to advance towards the adopted Vision of a more affordable, connected, diverse, healthy and vibrant Bay Area for all.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Input</h3>

<p><strong>Public input is key in the success of the Plan Bay Area 2050 Blueprint, and we want to hear from you in 3 easy steps:</strong></p>

</ol><h3>Public Workshops</h3>

<p>See the list of <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/meetings-and-events#events">upcoming Public Workshops</a> and join us in real time to learn more and share your feedback.</p>

<h3>From <em>Horizon</em> to the Blueprint to the Plan</h3>

<p>Before now, the Horizon Initiative tested strategies against a wide range of external forces, exploring which policies and investments were best prepared for an uncertain future – from rising telecommute levels to economic boom &amp; bust cycles to consumer preference shifts. Creating the Blueprint is a key first step toward creating the Plan itself, and thus the Blueprint planning phase will require iteration and deep engagement of the public, stakeholders and elected officials.</p>

<p>The Plan Bay Area 2050 Draft Blueprint weaves together transportation, housing, economic and environmental strategies, alongside an expanded set of growth geographies, to advance critical climate and equity goals. Designed to accommodate the 1.5 million new homes necessary to house future growth and address overcrowding, as well as 1.4 million new jobs, the Draft Blueprint integrates critical strategies to address our severe and longstanding housing crisis. With infrastructure investments in walking, biking and public transportation – as well as critical sea level protections designed to keep most Bay Area communities from flooding through 2050 – the Draft Blueprint makes meaningful steps towards the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Vision.</p>

<p>While still remaining fiscally constrained per federal planning requirements, the Draft Blueprint includes available revenues from Needs and Revenue assessments as well as new regional revenues for transportation, housing, economic development and environmental resilience.</p>

<h3>Highlights of the Draft Blueprint include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Improving Affordability for All:</strong> The Draft Blueprint reduces the cost burden for housing and transportation, with even greater reductions for low-income residents.</li>
	<li><strong>Expanding Housing Opportunities:</strong> The Draft Blueprint integrates investments to build more than 400,000 new permanently-affordable homes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing Growth in Walkable Places:</strong> The Draft Blueprint focuses the majority of new homes and new jobs in walkable communities with frequent transit services.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving Lives and Protecting Communities:</strong> In addition to saving more than 1,500 lives from roadway crashes through 2050, the Draft Blueprint also protects 98 percent of housing units at risk of sea level rise inundation through the year 2050 with new resilient infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Positioning the Region for Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Despite over $200 billion in new taxes in the decades ahead to pay for the bold strategies approved in February 2020, Bay Area businesses are forecasted to rebound robustly.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>While writing the post on AWS reservations I started thinking if there’s any arbitrage opportunity in the reservations. For example - does it make sense to do a 1 year or 3 year reservation for some instance types of upgrade an instance class to get a better reservation value?</p>

<p>You can do this manually using ec2instances.info which provides a quick way to look at EC2 pricing info although forces you to pick the type of reservations you’re interested in. To speed things up I just ran the <a href="https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info">ec2instances.info script</a> to scrape the data into a JSON with a <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/analyze-ec2instance.info">quick script</a> to extract the relevant details into a CSV file. After that, it was as simple as loading into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5H3vsZluk1_TGGMGrZq-KFiha-Bfhu4OBzyp5QynA8/edit#gid=0">Google sheets</a> for some analysis and visualization.</p>

<p>There are a few surprises - the biggest was how much of a variance there is by instance type. The smallest discount comes with the 1 year convertible, no up front payment option and ranges from around 21% for the i3en series but goes up to 49% for the i2 series. I’m sure most of this is a function of the age and demand for the types but it’s worth auditing use cases to see whether you get more bang for the buck on a slightly older instance. The same pattern holds when you look at the 3 year full up front payment options. The i2 series gets you a 75% discount while the discount on the i3en series climbs to 62%.</p>

<p>Another interesting analysis is to compare the cheapest reserved option (1 year convertible, no upfront) with the most expensive (3 year standard, full upfront) to check out the outliers. As expected, they’re strongly correlated but you do so see variance - for example the p2 and p3 series have a similar discount for the 1 year term term but the p2 gets you a 10% larger discount than the p3 for the 3 year term.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"> 



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  In the history of shortwave receivers, the Wadley loop played an
  important role. It was invented by the South African engineer Trevor
  Wadley in 1946 and it was applied in professional shortwave receivers
  from Racal in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s it was popular in
  amateur shortwave receivers until it gave way to PLL synthesizer
  circuits.

</p><p>
  It is a very clever circuit that made it possible to construct
  shortwave receivers that covered the entire HF spectrum with good
  image rejection, good dial accuracy and good frequency stability
  (adequate for SSB). Circuit complexity and cost were modest compared
  to other receiver designs that met the same requirements.

</p><p>
  The Wadley loop utilizes two tuning knobs that tune two different
  continuously variable frequency oscillators (VFOs). The first tuning
  knob tunes to the required megahertz band from 0 to 29. Though it
  controls a continuously variable oscillator, it appears to act as a
  band switch. Due to drift cancelation, any deviation from an integer
  multiple of 1MHz is canceled out. The second tuning knob tunes to
  the exact frequency within one megahertz band.
 
  
</p><h2>History of shortwave receivers</h2>

<p>
  The very first shortwave receivers used regenerative circuits. They
  typically had one or more RF amplifiers (vacuum tubes) with tuned
  circuits between them. All of these tuned circuits were tuned to the
  received frequency. This is called a TRF (Tuned Radio Frequency)
  receiver. The final RF amplification tube had positive feedback,
  such that it nearly oscillated but not quite. This provided much
  gain and selectivity, but setting the feedback level just right was
  critical. Too much and the circuit would oscillate. Satisfactory
  results could already be had with just the regenerative tube without
  any other amplifiers before it. But if you made such receiver to
  oscillate, the whole neighborhood would be treated to a howling
  sound. This was a problem especially in the normal broadcast bands
  (mediumwave and in Europe also longwave).

</p><p>
  After 1930, the superheterodyne receiver would be used nearly
  universally.  It would provide uniform and good nearby selectivity
  across the tuning range, something a TRF receiver could not do. Plus
  that you did not treat the whole neighborhood to a howling sound if
  you did not know how to tune properly. In a superheterodyne
  receiver, a variable oscillator is used to mix the received signal
  to a fixed frequency, the Intermediate Frequency of IF. Further
  amplification and filtering is performed at that fixed frequency. By
  varying the oscillator frequency you tune to a different station. As
  the oscillator is at a frequency different from the received
  frequency and the signal is not very close to the antenna
  input. radiation from the local oscillator is typically not a
  problem for the neighbors.
  
</p><p>
  Around World War 2, even professional communications receivers were
  still standard superheterodynes. They may have used a higher than
  standard IF and an extra tuned RF stage to improve image rejection,
  but the basic system was the same.

</p><p>
  In the 1950s and 1960s many professional communications receivers
  would use double conversion (two different IF frequencies). Further
  they would use one carefully calibrated Variable Frequency
  Oscillator (VFO) and mix its output with numerous different crystal
  frequencies to obtain the local oscillator signal for all bands.
  This way the VFO could have only one tuning range at a comparatively
  low frequency, so its stability and dial accuracy could be good
  enough for SSB and RTTY. Double conversion for these receivers still
  meant IF frequencies of 1 to 3MHz, certainly not 40MHz or higher.

</p><p>
  For example the German Rohde &amp; Schwarz EK07 receiver of the 1960s
  has a first IF of 3.3MHz (for the higher bands) and it has a VFO at
  a 3.4-6.4MHz, a 3MHz wide range. To obtain the required
  stability and dial accuracy for such a comparatively wide range it
  relied heavily on mechanical precision engineering, rather than clever
  circuit design.
   
</p><p>
  One brand of professional communications receivers however, used
  the Wadley loop. This brand was Racal, producer of the famous RA17
  receivers.  And yes, it does use a first IF of around 40MHz, hence it
  does not require special treatment of the lower bands (which would
  need single conversion if the first IF was lower). Now the RA17 did
  use mechanical precision engineering for the VFO, but the
  requirements were less strict than for the EK07 (having only a third
  of the tuning range). And the number of switches and band-dependent
  filters was drastically reduced compared to the EK07.

</p><p>
  In 1973 the same Wadley loop was introduced in a consumer grade
  receiver, the Barlow Wadley XCR30. Although its performance was much
  less than that of the Racal, it cost only a small fraction (around
  1/25th of price of the Racal). Its performance was much better than
  that of any general coverage receivers you could buy in this price
  range. The Yaesu FRG-7 was introduced in 1977 and it performed
  considerably better than the Barlow Wadley. 
  
</p><p>
  The Wadley loop had its limitations though and in the 1970s,
  professional communications receivers moved to PLL synthesizers to
  generate their tunable local oscillator signals to mix the received
  signal to a high first IF. Amateur receivers followed suit after
  1980. In the meantime there were some very interesting designs that
  combined a VFO (tuning a 1MHz wide range) with a PLL synthesizer to
  generate 1MHz multiples. This system was used by the Kenwood R1000
  and Yaesu FRG-7700.

</p><p>
  Modern receivers use direct digital synthesis (DDS) instead of (or
  combined with) PLL synthesizers. In the 1990s some high end
  communications receivers digitized the final IF signal and did the
  IF filtering and demodulation digitally in a DSP (digital signal
  processor). This technique is now commonplace, even in cheap
  receivers. Instead of a dedicated DSP chip one can use the power of a
  modern personal computer to do the job. There is now a trend to use
  a low first (and only) intermediate frequency, typically less than
  48kHz, in the range of normal sound cards. To suppress the image
  frequency, one can use two mixers and two AD converters, each fed by
  oscillator signals of the same frequency and 90 degrees apart. This
  is called quadrature mixing.

</p><p>
  As of 2016 it is now even possible to directly digitize the entire HF
  spectrum from 0 to 30MHz and do all further processing in a
  computer. No more mixers, no more image frequencies (but you still
  need good anti-aliasing filters).

  
</p><h2>The superheterodyne receiver</h2>

<p>
Let's start with an ordinary superheterodyne circuit for a standard
LW/MW radio, whose diagram is shown below. Such radios were made from
the 1930s to the 1990s. The received signal (either in the longwave
range 150-350kHz or in the mediumwave range 530-1620kHz) is fed
through a preselector, typically a parallel resonant LC circuit of a
fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The coil could be wound on a
ferrite bar, so the coil itself would act as an antenna. The received
signal is mixed with a variable oscillator to obtain the desired 455kHz
intermediate frequency. The oscillator also contains a resonant LC
circuit containing a fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The
variable capacitor is typically a dual variable capacitor where both
capacitors are on a single shaft so they are varied both by rotating
the shaft. Both the preselector and the oscillator have two tuning
ranges. The coils for both ranges can be switched using a band switch.

</p><p>
<img src="https://lennartb.home.xs4all.nl/radio/superhet.svg" width="1000" alt="Block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver">

</p><p>
The 455kHz IF signal is fed through a series of narrow band filters
and amplifiers. The filters select the 455kHz signal with a well
defined bandwidth (around 10kHz in an AM broadcast receiver). The
amplified signal is then demodulated using a diode detector. The
demodulated signal is further amplified and fed to a speaker.

</p><p>
In traditional radios these filters were constructed from transformers
and capacitors. In more modern radios you would find ceramic
resonators. Communications receivers would contain several ceramic
filters with different bandwidths, that can be
selected. Communications receivers would also contain a BFO, a Beat
Frequency Oscillator that oscillates near the 455kHz IF. The diode
detector could then be replaced by a product detector, which is
basically another mixer.

</p><p>
Finally we would have an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit. The
amplified IF signal is detected by another diode and then smoothed
using a much larger capacitor to eliminate all modulation and just
retain the carrier level. This signal is used to control (reduce) the
gain of the IF amplifiers. This reduces the effect of fading and it
reduces the difference in audio level between strong and weak
stations.

  
</p><h2>Problems with the superheterodyne for shortwave</h2>

<p>
  The standard superheterodyne works surprisingly well for mediumwave
  and longwave. But if we move on to shortwave, we will run into the
  problem of image frequencies. In a superheterodyne circuit, two
  frequencies will mix to the desired IF (f1) if you tune the
  oscillator to a given frequency f2. f2+f1 and f2-f1. So if you tune
  the oscillator to 1455kHz and the IF is 455kHz, both an input signal
  of 1000kHz (f2-f1) and an input signal of 1910kHz (f1+f2) will mix
  to the IF. We do have a tunable preselector and 1910kHz (unwanted) is far
  removed from 1000kHz (wanted), so there will be no problem.

</p><p>
  But on shortwave the situation is different. If you tune to
  15100kHz, the image frequency is at 16010kHz, well within the range
  of a single resonant LC circuit used a a preselector.

</p><p>
  There are two straightforward ways to reduce the
  problem. Professional shortwave receivers of the 1940s would
  typically use both methods combined:

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p>



<p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations.</p>

<h4 id="asymptotic-complexity-for-trivial-solution">Asymptotic Complexity for Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Using hashing, we should be able to check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations in $O(1)$. However, most of the computational cost comes from evaluating $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, if we are extremely lucky and the first two evaluated values $f(\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\mathbf{x}_1)$, then we are done and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x}_0 \oplus \mathbf{x}_1$. However, in the worst scenario, we would have to have evaluate $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, we would know it after evaluating $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ by realizing that there are no two evaluated values are the same.</p>



<p>Therefore, using the trivial solution, in the worst scenario, we would have to run the evaluation $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to determine the value of $\mathbf{c}$.</p>



<p>So the question is, can we do better?</p>

<h3 id="simons-algorithm">Simon’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="design-quantum-circus">Design Quantum Circus</h4>

<p>Similar to the quantum gates we used for the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> and the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, the black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$.</p>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, for $\mathbf{x} \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \{0, 1\}^n$. When $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{0} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| \mathbf{y} \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is not necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{y} \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check if we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions and $U_f$.</p>



<p>We have the following quantum circus. Let’s compute the each of the quantum states in the circus. The mathematics is actually much easier compared to the ones in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>









<p>Suppose $\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{x}_1 \oplus \mathbf{c}$, and we also have $\mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{x}_2 \oplus \mathbf{c}$. Because</p>







<p>We could further rearrange $|\varphi_3\rangle $,</p>



<p>Note that $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle$ is a binary value. When $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle = 1$, $\sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \frac{(-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x} \rangle} \big( 1 + (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle} \big) }{2} = 0$, which means that for the top output qubits, we have exact zero probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$. We could only observe $\mathbf{z}$ whose $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$ for the top output qubits.</p>



<p>Statistically, when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$, for all $\mathbf{z} \in \{0,1\}^2$. This means all $\mathbf{z}$ are possible to be observed from the top output qubits. So what is the probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$, $p(\mathbf{z})$? Is it uniformly distributed?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} = 0$ and $f$ is an one-to-one mapping, we have</p>









<p>So when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $p(\mathbf{z})$ is a uniform distribution and $p(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{2^n}$.</p>



<p>How about when $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$ and $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The deep ocean is one of the most challenging places for any animal to live. Creatures that live in the deep ocean cope with high water pressures, cold temperatures, food scarcity, and a lack of sunlight. There are <a href="http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/ocean-layers.html">three “zones”</a> of the ocean, which are defined by how much sunlight they get. Sea water scatters and absorbs light, so the deeper you go, the darker it becomes. The surface zone is referred to as the “sunlight zone”. This is where most marine species live, and where plankton, kelp, and algae are able to photosynthesize. At about 650 feet, a fish will enter what is known as the “twilight zone”, where sunlight rapidly decreases with depth. At 3,300 feet down, in the “midnight zone”, there is no light other than the light that animals themselves create.</p>

<p>A big problem that fish in the twilight zone face is how to camouflage themselves. With low levels of sunlight coming from above and no light source below them, the fish appear as obvious silhouettes to predators swimming below and make for easy meals. However there are certain fish families, such as dragonfish, lanternfish, and hatchetfish, which use <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZWWyimUGI">counter-</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZWWyimUGI"><em>illumination</em></a> to camouflage themselves from predators below.</p>

<p>Counter-illumination is when an animal emits light from its underside to avoid being seen from below. Fish that are able to counter-illuminate have special organs called photophores on their bottom half, or ventral side, to create light. They create this light either through a chemical reaction, or through a<em> symbiotic relationship</em> with bacteria that live within the photophore.</p>
<p>But how do fish know how bright their photophores should be? Just like on land, light in the ocean fluctuates based on factors like the weather and what time of day it is. These fish can adjust the strength of the light produced by their photophores to match the intensity of the light coming from above them, but most fish have forward facing eyes, so there is no way for them to see the light they are producing on the ventral side of their body. Davis and co-authors aimed to solve this mystery by looking at photophores found on the faces of these deep sea fish.</p>
<p><strong>What did they find?</strong></p>
<p>Davis and co-authors used 21 fish that were collected and preserved on research cruises between 2009 and 2017 from the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 15 preserved specimens that they borrowed from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. They targeted specific species that had photophores around their eyes, but did not use the photophores on their face as a “search light”. Species that used photophores as a search light use the light they produce as a flashlight to attract and hunt prey, like the angler fish from Finding Nemo.</p>
<div id="attachment_27368"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27368" src="https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=422%2C364&amp;ssl=1" alt="Three images of fish in the Davis et al. study. Arrows show the direction of light from the photophores, moving towards the fish’s eyes. " width="422" height="364" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=300%2C259&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=150%2C129&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=768%2C663&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?resize=232%2C200&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i1.wp.com/oceanbites.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/figure_fish.png?w=891&amp;ssl=1 891w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-27368">Three images of fish in the Davis et al. study. Arrows show the direction of light from the photophores, moving towards the fish’s eyes.</p></div>
<p>Once they had collected and described these fish and their relationship to one another, they looked at the direction in which the photophores were facing using a microscope and a miniature version of a CT scan. They found photophores that faced the fish’s eyes in all of the species that had photophores used for camouflage. All of these eye facing photophores were also surrounded by a layer of melanin, the same pigment that is responsible for determining the color of human skin and hair color. This layer of melanin focused the light from the photophores towards the fish’s eyes. In some of the fish species the eye had adapted to have a special opening in its lens, called the <em>aphakic gap</em>, which was lined up with the light produced by their photophores.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that fish that had eye facing photophores used them as a calibration tool to match the intensity of the light around them. They used this specialized photophore as a proxy for the brightness of their ventral photophores, and then were able to adjust the light they were producing to eliminate their silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></p>
<p>This research is a great example of how scientists use <em><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/science-magazines/biology-comparative-morphology-studies-structure-and-function">morphology</a></em>, or the form of an animal, to see how it is related to other animals and how its body has evolved over time. Davis and co- authors were able to construe that these two traits, having photophores on their bellies and photophores facing their eyes, evolved dependently. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIEoO5KdPvg">Dependent trait evolution </a></em><em>&nbsp;</em>occurs when two traits that are tied to each other evolve at the same time. Because the photophores on the face of the fish determined how they were able to control their counter-illumination, and better counter-illumination led to better camouflage, fish that evolved to have both of these traits had a greater chance of survival and a greater opportunity to reproduce to pass down those traits to their offspring.</p>

        <div>
                        
            
            
<p>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data. </p>



<div><p>Tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clicktale.com/" target="_blank">Clicktale </a>take these one step further and actually provide real-time playback of what a user is doing on a website. This is also possible across sessions and even can follow a user from signup all the way through onboarding – it’s really up to you. At first glance, this seems like a godsend. The ability to actually watch what people do on your site – where they get stuck or what they’re reading when they ultimately convert or exit is one of the more powerful funnel optimization tools to come out in the past decade. I personally can attest to their efficacy. They helped me drop a SaaS CAC from $1,250 to $100 in 3 months. </p><p>There are many other instances in which I have gone into a business, implemented one of these tools, and improved conversion rates by an order of magnitude in a fraction of the time it used to take. In just a few days of watching sessions it is possible to tell:</p></div>



<ul><li>What is preventing users from converting</li><li>Where are customers losing interest in the page</li><li>Why people are dropping out of the checkout process</li><li>What content users focus in on and what they skim past</li><li>What part of the site or app crashed and how did it happen</li></ul>



<p>These are all incredibly powerful insights in the hands of a skilled marketer, so what gives? Why doesn’t everyone secretly record their users and optimize based on the data? First, its helpful to understand what session replay is, and what it isn’t…</p>



<h2>What EXACTLY is Session Replay?</h2>



<p>Session Replay is precisely what it sounds like – the ability for the site owner, or someone else, to replay the session a specific user experienced while on the site. It includes scroll activity, mouse activity, clicks, swipes, taps, and just about any other action you can think of on a website. It has a lot of other names but session replay is generally the widely accepted term that these SaaS platforms use themselves.</p>



<p>It lets you see EXACTLY where someone gets stuck so that you can design a way to fix it and reduce the friction within whatever action you’re trying to get a user to take. It can also let you remotely diagnose speed or loading issues for customers – taking it one step beyond tools like Lighthouse. Being able to see specifically which files load slowly in the real world and on real users’ devices is amazing from an optimization standpoint.</p>



<p>With that being said, these tools themselves carry a pretty heavy payload and can slow down your site by a double-digit percentage on their own. On their own they are not enough to improve the efficacy of your site or app – they need to be wielded by a scrappy marketer who can identify the issues and implement solutions to solve them. </p>



<h2>Visionary or Voyeur?</h2>



<p>While periodically I feel like a voyeur when using these tools, I do see the benefits and generally feel they outweigh the privacy concerns. In my experience the friction in implementing these tools generally comes from the engineering team who feels like they infringe on privacy rights. Are they right? Well, sort of. Out of the box these tools have the ability to record usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. That is where the implementation of the tool, both from a tech standpoint and from a configuration standpoint within the platform comes into play.  It is easy to block certain fields from recording into these tools, but generally, it has to be done manually.</p>



<p>FullStory blocks password and CC number by default but those can both be disabled by a less than honest marketer in order to get additional information about a customer. While I have never seen or heard that happening myself, it is certainly possible as these tools don’t require the obfuscation of some of the more sensitive data. </p>



<p>Some point to the feeling of “big brother” watching your users browse around on the website. Which is kind of what it is doing, but the blind spot here is that the marketer (me) generally doesn’t care who the user is – they just want to know what is getting in the way of the conversion, something session replay does better than any other tool out there at the moment. If the dataset were wiped of any personally identifiable information, it would still be useful to watch anonymized sessions move through a funnel and pinpoint friction.</p>



<div><p>Technically you’re also supposed to list the fact that you are using these types of programs within your Privacy Policy or EULA, and you’re even supposed to be able to toggle the script on or off within a “cookie bar” in order to totally comply with today’s regulations but I have yet to see that actually happen.</p><p>Additionally, who knows what these companies are doing with the data they have? Could they be mining it only to sell advice on optimizing funnels to the highest bidder? It really does allow for a lot of data and PII to cross into the unknown. How can someone even opt-out of this data collection if they wanted to? </p></div>



<h2>Are They Worth Using?</h2>



<p>The short answer is yes. On the surface you cant find a much more effective tool at optimizing the behavior on your website. The magic combo would be to combine session replay with a CRO tool like Optimizely or VWO to identify issues and then implement tests to counter them.</p>



<p>The longer answer depends on your conscious. In a time where people are increasingly worried about identity theft, facial recognition, and giving too much data to big tech companies, session replay does straddle the line between effective optimization tool and privacy nightmare. It’s worth evaluating the stance of your company on privacy and data security issues before implementing one of these tools.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>

<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=696%2C500&amp;ssl=1" alt="Casio FW91" width="696" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=585%2C420&amp;ssl=1 585w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

  <div><p>I sort of feel swamped by things that I don't know, almost to the point of paralysis.</p></div><div><p>I'm new to Ruby on Rails and know that there is a huge ocean of knowledge that I could keep swimming in, but then again I'm competent enough to build this reasonably functioning Taaalk website. I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

            <div><div>
  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>This essay will hopefully be the first post in a series covering some of the basics of how things in the past, particularly in the ancient world, were made.  This isn’t a how-to guide (we’re not going to go into that much depth) but instead intended as a window into the many tasks that made a pre-modern society <em>work</em>, tasks that are so often <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">left </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/19/the-lonely-city-part-ii-real-cities-have-curves/">out </a>of the modern imagination of the past.  Throughout, I want to highlight not only the jobs, but also <strong>the people who did them</strong> and the <strong>human landscapes they created</strong>.</p>



<p>Each entry in this series is likely to come in multiple parts – as you will soon see, almost everything worth making has to be made in quite a few steps and each step is often complex enough to occupy its own weekly post.  I <em>think</em> this series will run in four parts (possibly with a fifth part addendum), but no plan survives contact with my tendency to overwrite.  I wanted to start with farming instead of something more flashy and exciting like iron production (where I know there is quite a lot of interest in how one goes from reddish rock to polished sword), for the simple reason that <strong>agriculture sits at the foundation of every other form of production</strong>.  Every person in an agrarian society whose job – mining, smithing, tanning, timber-cutting, trading, tailoring, <em>everything</em> – doesn’t involve primary food production is subsisting off of the food production of others, typically (as we’ll see) <em>many</em> others.</p>



<p>That said, <em>this post</em> is mostly about <strong>farmers</strong> more than <em>farming</em> (we will talk about the mechanics of farming, just not right away!).  One thing I want to highlight in this series are the many different jobs and occupations <em>and the people who did them</em> who tend to lurk in the background of our imagination of the past, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">where they appear at all</a>.  And in the case of farming in much of the pre-modern world, the survival strategies of subsistence farmers exert a very strong shaping influence on the countryside and life for non-farmers (terminology note: ‘subsistence’ farming refers to farming directed primarily towards the survival of the farmers and their families; in much of the pre-modern world, there was a fairly sharp divide between <em>most</em> farmers who farmed on a subsistence basis and the largest market-oriented estates of the wealthy, who will be our focus <em>next</em> week).</p>



<p>As a final caveat before we dive in, I specialize in the economy of the ancient Mediterranean, so my observations here are going to tend (where not otherwise noted) to be <em>most</em> true in the Mediterranean world, in that period (c. 650 BC – 450 AD).  Where I know there are major exceptions, I’ll try to note them, but it’s simply not possible to know every production permutation <em>everywhere</em> and at <em>every</em> time.  For this series, we’re going to focus on wheat production, with a bit of a Mediterranean bias (but I’ve tried to pull in some evidence from North China as well; by and large I’ve found that wheat cultivation seems to create <em>similar </em>patterns everywhere, but there is local variation).</p>

<p><strong>Bibliography note at the outset</strong>: for the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have an easy footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but I’ll include a bibliography note up front for the whole series.  My information for the ancient Mediterranean is drawn from a number of sources, the most important of which are P. Erdkamp, <em>The Grain Market in the Roman Empire</em> (2005); N. Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War: Farms, Families and Death in the Middle Republic</em> (2004); Foxhall and Forbes, “Σιτομετρεία: The Role of Grain as a Staple Food in Classical Antiquity,” <em>Chiron</em> 12 (1982) and Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” <em>JRS</em> 80 (1990), and just reading a pile of Greek and Roman agricultural writers (Columella, Cato, Pliny the Elder, Xenophon, etc).<br>Note also C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2014), W. Scheidel, <em>Death on the Nile</em> (2001) and R. Bagnall and B. Frier, <em>The Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(1994) for the Egyptian demographic modeling.  Egypt is an important reference for demographic data because relatively more records survive there due to the arid conditions preserving papyrus.<br>I am less well read on Medieval European agriculture, but I should note some reliance here on M. Bloch, <em><em>La Société Féodale</em></em> (1940; available trans. Manyon, 1962) and E.L.R. Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966; available trans. J. Day, 1976).  Also relevant on general features and broad continuity, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge</em> (2003); for the military history minded, Landers (and Rosenstein) are more focused on the connection between agriculture and military activity.<br>My references to Chinese agriculture are from Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980).</p>



<h2>Why Bread?</h2>



<p>From the outset I want to note that agriculture, especially subsistence agriculture, typically is not planting simple mono-cultures of a single crop.  I opted to focus in this series on <strong>bread</strong> because it is <em><strong>usefully simple</strong></em> for a number of reasons.  It lets us focus on wheat and barley, which are relatively simple crops to talk about but also (in the broad sweep of Eurasia where they were the primary crop) provided the majority of calories for the <em><strong>vast</strong></em> majority of people.  Vegetables, fruit, meat, other animal products (along with sauces and things derived from them) were in the ancient Mediterranean generally expensive things, used by most normal people (read: the not-super-rich) to <em>flavor</em> a meal that still consisted mostly of bread, when they were available at all.  That’s because (as we’ll see) wheat and barley were efficient and cheap to grow at scale.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that people <em>only</em> ate bread, to be clear.  The Mediterranean diet is built on a <em>triad</em> of grapes, grains and olives; animal products were also in the diet.  Grains don’t have a broad enough range of nutrients to really subsist someone forever; you need proteins and vitamins and so on.  <strong><em>But</em></strong> when we are looking at the bulk of what was eaten any way we measure it – calories, volume, weight, labor intensity, economic scale – cheap, mass-available grains just dominate, so that’s where we start.  When scholars model ancient agriculture and food habits, they build a nutritional model centered on grains and then supplement with other things as necessary (which as an aside is <em>also</em> how the Greeks and Romans actually talk about food – rations that we are quite sure included meat and vegetables are typically given as grain allowances, e.g. Thuc 4.16.1; Plut. <em>Lyc</em>. 12.2; Plb. 6.39.13; Cato, <em>de Agr.</em> 56).</p>



<p>Finally, a <strong>terminology note</strong>: when I say <strong>wheat</strong> I mean genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"><em>triticum</em> </a>and its subspecies; when I say <strong>barley</strong> I mean <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">Hordeum vulgare</a></em>.  I am going to use ‘grain’ or ‘grains’ to refer to both crops together (although there are many other grains).  The British frequently use the word ‘corn’ to refer to wheat; this causes no end of confusion in Americans, for whom ‘corn’ means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">maize</a>.  I do not know that I will reference maize, but if I do, I will call it maize and to avoid confusion, I am not going to use corn at all as a term.  Apologies to my British readers whose usage is, I should note, older but also more confusing.</p>



<p>To start with, we need to start not with our crops, <strong>but with our farm and farmers.</strong></p>



<h2>The Farming Household</h2>



<p>Looking at our peasant household, what we generally have are large families on small farms.  The households in these farms were not generally nuclear households, but extended ones.  Pre-Han Chinese documents assume a household to include three generations: two elderly parents, their son, his wife, and their four children (eight individuals total).  Ptolemaic and Roman census data reveal a bewildering array of composite families, including multi-generational homes, but also households composed of multiple nuclear families of siblings (so a man, his wife, his brother and then brother’s wife and their children, for instance), and so on.<strong>  Normal family units tended to be around eight individuals, but with wide variation</strong> (for comparison, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html">the average household size in the United States for a family is 3.14</a>).</p>

Note how many individuals (presumably a mix of neighbors, friends and the extended family) are attached to this dwelling – and also how it is a multi-purpose structure, both a workshop and residence.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time that households <strong>were <em>large</em> (by modern standards), the farms they tilled were, by modern standards, very small</strong>.  The normal size of a Roman household small farm is generally estimated between 5 and 8 <em>iugera</em> (a Roman measurement of land, roughly 3 to 5 acres); in pre-Han Northern China (where wheat and millet, not rice, were the staple crops), the figure was “one hundred mu (4.764 acres)” – essentially the same.  In Languedoc, a study of Saint-Thibery in 1460 showed 118 households (out of 189) on farms of less than 20 <em>setérée</em> (12 acres or so; the <em>setérée </em>appears to be an inexact unit of measurement); 96 of them were on less than 10 <em>setérée</em> (about 6 acres).  So while there is a <em>lot</em> of variation, <strong>by and large it seems like the largest cluster of household farms tend to be around 3 to 8 acres or so; 5 acre farms are a good ‘average’ small farm.</strong></p>



<p>This coincidence of normal farm size and family size is not an accident, but essentially represents …</p></div></div>

<p><span>A groundswell of support is emerging for families of the victims of April’s mass killing and their demands for a public inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span>On Thursday, the provincial and federal governments </span><a href="https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/province-house/no-public-inquiry-into-mass-murders/"><span>announced a joint independent review</span></a><span> would be conducted into the tragedy rather than a public inquiry. That’s what victims’ families, national women’s organizations, senators, and many others had asked for.</span></p>
<p><span>Hours after the announcement, Dawn Parke became an administrator of a newly created Facebook group called </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/306124757254346/?multi_permalinks=306663027200519&amp;notif_id=1595612557492154&amp;notif_t=group_activity&amp;ref=notif"><span>‘Nova Scotians for a Public Inquiry.</span></a><span>’</span><span> Within 12 hours, they had more than 3,600 members. As of Friday afternoon, it had jumped to 6,000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Parke said her priority is ensuring the families of the victims — some of whom have joined the page — are supported and heard. She wasn’t surprised to see the group’s numbers grow so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s a lot of anger, and the majority of the people that have joined the page believe that there are mistakes, that this is a cover up, and that there’s been no transparency,” Parke said in an interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There are people from every different background, regardless of political affiliation or personal belief. I think we are all united in our grief and in our rage and the ineptitude that has been demonstrated.”</span></p>
<p><span>Parke lives in Moncton, NB now, but grew up in Colchester County, specifically Wentworth. She knew three of the victims personally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I went to high school with them, was friends with them, interacted with them,” she said. “But I think all of Nova Scotia has a connection to this whether we knew the victims personally or we know other people who knew them personally.”</span></p>
<p><span>Parke said many Nova Scotians reaching out via the group say they have no faith in the review process announced yesterday. She said even if the review could address all their concerns and get the answers they were seeking, the level of mistrust in government is currently too deep. Because a public inquiry is what the families want and need, she believes we should all be listening to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is their (the governments’) version of a bandaid, or in some ways a muzzle, not just for the victims and their families, but for all of our communities and for all women,” Parke said.</span></p>
<p><span>“This has the potential to explode because we’re at a very serious level of public anger and public mistrust in Nova Scotia, and I don’t think that our politicians should be ignoring that.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although the group is focused on Nova Scotia, Parke said many Canadians are coming onboard and they welcome and encourage anyone with concerns to join them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“There have been countless communities across Canada that have faced this type of violence before and haven’t received the answers that they’re looking for, and I think as Nova Scotians and Canadians we’re all fed up with the lack of transparency,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is taxpayers’ money that goes into these institutions and that they have complete control over what’s shared publicly is unacceptable…These people were our friends, our neighbours, our nurses, family, and we need to get justice for them and justice includes a public, independent inquiry.”</span></p>
<h3>Petition gaining momentum <span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>Parke is also actively encouraging members of the group to sign an online petition created last night by Dartmouth resident Jenny Negus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/government-of-nova-scotia-have-a-public-inquiry-into-nova-scotia-s-mass-shooting?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23669419_en-CA%3A4&amp;recruiter=1134470319&amp;recruited_by_id=cb26d2c0-cd48-11ea-a7f6-6fa128536285&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial"><span>Negus’s petition</span></a><span> calls on the federal and provincial governments to hold a public inquiry. She started it at the request of a family member of one of the victims who was killed by the gunman the Halifax Examiner refers to as GW.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of Friday afternoon, the number of signatures on her petition had exceeded 5,800.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although her initial target was 500 signatures, it grew so quickly that she now has much loftier goals. Negus’s ultimate hopes is that the petition swells into the tens of thousands and forces the federal and provincial governments to reverse course on the independent review and deliver on a public inquiry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It is disgusting and it’s unbelievable that an independent review was called because that’s not what they’re asking for, they’re not asking for a quick answer, they’re asking for an inquiry,” Negus said.</span></p>
<p><span>“This has affected everybody. It has affected people, families and communities right across Nova Scotia, and they all care about each other. Nova Scotians aren’t a ‘one-for-all’ kind of people, we try to be there for each other.”</span></p>
<p><span>Negus said the length of time it took to arrive at an independent review coupled with all the questions and mistrust in government has many Nova Scotians frustrated and grateful for a way to express their anger over Thursday’s decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It takes two minutes to sign it to support them (the families). I’m in contact with at least one person from each family and they’ve all thanked me, they’ve all said this is needed,” she said.</span></p>
<h3>NDP calls for emergency sitting</h3>
<p><span>On Friday morning, NDP leader Gary Burrill wrote to Premier Stephen McNeil calling for an emergency sitting of the legislature in order to put forward a bill seeking to establish a full public inquiry into the events of April 18-19.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Citing “grave concerns” with the independent review approach over a public inquiry, Burrill said people were “rightfully confounded” at the decision to do “anything short” of a public inquiry.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In an interview, NDP justice spokesperson Claudia Chender said the process announced yesterday has led to a deluge of emails from constituents asking her to advocate for a public inquiry. She said criticism over the decision appears to be “almost universal.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I think it’s rare that you see such a unified response to a government action, and so in the past 24 hours or so since the review was announced we’ve heard almost universal condemnation,” Chender said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Even Minister Mark Furey in the press conference yesterday when asked admitted that in fact no one asked for a review, but hundreds if not thousands of people have asked for an inquiry.”</span></p>
<p><span>Chender said a decision of this magnitude is far too important for the government to make without “being held to account” publicly. She said it must be done in the legislative context so they can introduce their bill mandating a public inquiry, have it debated, and ask questions of the justice minister.</span></p>
<p><span>“We could make our arguments that we’ve heard on behalf of our constituents and they could respond to them, and we could have a fulsome debate which we think this deserves,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I think we’ve heard an almost universal sentiment that Nova Scotians asked for a public inquiry and they deserve one.”</span></p>
<h3>McNeil: ‘doing everything we possibly can’</h3>
<p><span>During Friday’s public COVID-19 media briefing, the premier was asked by several reporters about the decision and the outrage it has provoked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>McNeil reiterated his belief that an independent review was the best approach, not a public inquiry. He said that if the three panel members at any point in the process believe they require more power, they can ask and the province will respond and work with them “to ensure that we get to the bottom and deliver on the answers.”</span></p>
<p><span>McNeil also said a critical component of the process for his government was ensuring that family members had access and were able to participate.</span></p>
<p><span>“I want to reassure all of those in this province who have been impacted by those two days or quite frankly have been feeling the pain and suffering that those families have been feeling,” McNeil said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We as a government are doing everything we possibly can to get to the bottom of those answers and will support these three prominent Canadians who have the ability to ensure that they get to those answers.”</span></p>

				<p>An irrational number is a number that can’t be represented as a fraction using integers for the numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of irrational numbers, and one of the biggest reasons for that is that they are great at making low discrepancy sequences, which give amazing results when used in stochastic (randomized) algorithms, compared to regular random numbers.  Low discrepancy sequences are cousins to blue noise because they both aim to keep samples well spread out, but the usage case is different, so it’s situational whether to use blue noise or an LDS.  That means that luckily there is room enough in the world for both LDS and blue noise.</p>
<p>This post is a random grab bag of things relating to irrational numbers.</p>
<p>Pythagorian cultists supposedly murdered someone to keep irrational numbers a secret, so this is technically forbidden knowledge, I guess.</p>

<p>Continued fractions are a way of writing numbers that can be useful for helping analyze irrational numbers, and rational approximations to specific numbers – whether they are rational or irrational.</p>
<p>If a continued fraction is infinitely long, that means it represents an irrational number, and all irrational numbers have continued fractions that are infinitely long.  If a continued fraction is not infinitely long, that means it’s a rational number.</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the continued fraction for pi.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Another way of writing continued fractions is to get rid of all the redundant “1 divided by…” and just write the integers you see on the left.  The continued fraction for pi above would look like this, which is a lot more compact:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how you make a continued fraction by walking through how to make it for pi, or at least 3.14159265359 anyways, since pi goes forever.</p>
<p>First up you take the integer part and use that as the first digit.  Subtracting that integer part out leaves you with a remainder:</p>
<p>[3]<br>
remainder: 0.14159265359 </p>
<p>We take 1/remainder to get 7.06251330592.  The integer part of this number is going to be our next number.  Subtracting the integer part out gives us our next remainder:</p>
<p>[3;7]<br>
remainder: 0.06251330592</p>
<p>1/remainder is 15.9965944095, which makes our next integer and remainder into:</p>
<p>[3;7,15]<br>
remainder: 0.9965944095</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.00341722818, so now we are at…</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]<br>
remainder: 0.00341722818</p>
<p>1/remainder is 292.63483365 so now we are at:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292]<br>
remainder: 0.63483365</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.57521580653 and we’ll stop at the next step:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292, 1]<br>
remainder: 0.57521580653</p>
<p>Wherever you have a large number in the continued fraction, it’s because you just did one divided by a small number. The larger the integer means the smaller the remainder there was to make that integer.</p>
<p>The smaller a remainder is, the better approximated the number is at that step of the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This means that when you see a large number in a continued fraction, that if you truncated the continued fraction right before that large number, you’d have a pretty good approximation of the actual number that the continued fraction represents.</p>
<p>The larger the number, the better the approximation.</p>
<p>Because of this, looking at the continued fraction for pi, below, you can see that it has a pretty large number (292) pretty early in the sequence.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>This means that the following continued fraction approximates pi “pretty well”.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]</p>
<p>We’ll cover how to figure this out further down in the post, but that fraction is actually 355/113 and has a special name “Milü”, found by Chinese mathematician and astronomer, Zǔ Chōngzhī, born 429 AD.  It is within 0.000009% of the value of pi.</p>
<p>More info from wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC</a></p>
<p>So, while pi is probably the most famous irrational number, it certain isn’t the most irrational number that there is, as it is so easily approximated by smallish integers in a division.</p>
<p>Quick note if you write a program to convert a floating point number to a continued fraction: If you try to make a continued fraction for a number that a floating point can’t represent exactly – such as 4.1 – you will get a very tiny remainder which then makes a very large integer when you flip it over.  In my case, when using doubles, it made such a large number that converting it to an integer overflowed the integer.  One way to address this is to just consider any remainder smaller than some threshold as zero.  Like maybe any remainder less than 0.00001 can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So even though pi is not the most irrational number, phi is (pronounced “fee”, and is aka the golden ratio).  Yes, it is the most irrational number!</p>
<p>We’ll use the value 1.61803398875 and make a continued fraction.</p>
<p>[1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1,1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>Wait a second… do you see a pattern? the remainder is always the same value, and then when we do 1/remainder we always get the golden ratio again.  That means this continued fraction is 1’s all the way into infinity.</p>
<p>In the last section we saw how having a large number in the continued fraction meant that a number was well approximated at that point in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>The golden ratio has a 1 for every number in the continued fraction, which is the smallest value you can have. That means it’s as least well approximated as you can be, at every stage in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the golden ratio being the most irrational number.  It’s the least well approximated by rational numbers (dividing one integer by another).</p>
<p>When I said I liked irrational numbers I was mainly talking about the golden ratio, but other highly irrational numbers, like the square root of 2, are also nice.  Highly irrational numbers have the properties that I like – the properties that make them useful to use as low discrepancy sequences.</p>
<p>An interesting thing you may have noticed above is that when you divide 1 by the golden ratio, you get the golden ratio minus 1.  That is:</p>
<p>1 / 1.61803398875 = 0.61803398875</p>
<p>If you replace the golden ratio with “x” you get this equation:</p>
<p>1/x = x-1</p>
<p>If you solve that equation, you will get the golden ratio out.  It is the only number that has this property! Well actually, -0.61803398875 does too, and relates to the fact that there is a + and – root solution to that quadratic equation, but maybe that’s not that surprising.  1/-0.61803398875 is -1.61803398875. The behavior is the same, it’s just happening on the other side of zero.</p>
<p>Something else interesting about the golden ratio is that if you square it, it’s the same as adding 1.</p>
<p>1.61803398875*1.61803398875=2.61803398875</p>
<p>That gives you a formula:</p>
<p>x*x = x+1</p>
<p>If you solve that, you get the golden ratio again as the only solution (well, and the negative golden ratio minus 1 just like before).  Probably not too surprising if you look at the formulas though, as you can use simple algebra to change one formula into the other.</p>

<p>If you had a continued fraction and wanted to turn it into a regular fraction (or real number), you could run the process in reverse.</p>
<p>However, doing that means you start at the right most digit of the continued fraction and work left til you get to the beginning. How do you do this with an infinitely long continued fraction, like an irrational number would have?</p>
<p>Luckily there is a way to start at the left and work right, so that you can get approximations to infinitely long continued fractions (irrational numbers).</p>
<p>Let’s do this with pi, with this much of the continued fraction:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1]</p>
<p>What you do is make a table which has a row for the numerator and denominator.  The first numerator is 1, and the first denominator is 0.  The second numerator is the first number in the continued fraction sequence, and the second denominator is 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>The formula for the rest of the numerators and denominators is…</p>
<ul>
<li>numerator[index] = CF[index] * numerator[index-1] + numerator[index-2]</li>
<li>denominator[index] = CF[index] * denominator[index-1] + denominator[index-2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing that from left to right, you get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Below we do that with pi, golden ratio, sqrt(2) and an irrational number i came up with that is not very irrational, and is well approximated by 1.01.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>A quick fun tangent is that you might notice that for golden ratio, both the numerators and denominators are the Fibonacci numbers.  This is the link between the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>Below shows the percentage error of each number, as more terms in the continued fraction are added.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Golden ratio error decreases the slowest which shows that the golden ratio is least well approximated by fractions.  The made up irrational number that is approximately 1.01 has error decreasing the fastest because it is the least irrational of these numbers.  Pi shows itself as having fairly low irrationality, and the square root of 2 is fairly irrational.</p>
<p>Here is the error on a log y axis to better show the difference in error.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that 1/goldenRatio aka 0.61803398875 is every bit as irrational as the golden ratio itself is.  The reason for this is that we are flipping the numerator and denominator over for this fraction that doesn’t exist.  Flipping it over doesn’t make it more representable as a fraction.</p>
<p>When I’m using the golden ratio for low discrepancy sequences, i usually use that 1/goldenRatio value, also known as “the golden ratio conjugate” because the smaller value means it’s going to have fewer numerical issues and more precision, when working with small values (like between 0 and 1).</p>
<p>Also, there are an infinite amount of numbers just as irrational as the golden ratio.  You can calculate them by calculating:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27+%3D+%28p%2Aa%2Bq%29+%2F+%28r%2Aa%2Bs%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0" alt="a' = (p*a+q) / (r*a+s)" title="a' = (p*a+q) / (r*a+s)"></p>
<p>where p,q,r,s are integers and the absolute value of p*s-q*r is 1.</p>
<p>That is the Moebius transform.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the least irrational number is, it looks like there are multiple (infinite) and they are just numbers that …</p></div></div>

    <p>How computationally expensive are various fundamental floating point mathematical operations? &nbsp;Here’s a quick and dirty benchmark, which, although surely quite naive, seems to capture the rough&nbsp;relative cost of a few operations.</p>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<p>This quarter I am taking a course on&nbsp;numerical linear algebra. &nbsp;Naturally, we are covering topics like the fundamentals of floating point arithmetic, numerical stability, matrix decompositions, and algorithm analysis.</p>

<p>In a few of our assignments, we are&nbsp;tasked with determining the <em>exact number of floating point operations</em> (FLOPs) required to execute some particular algorithm. Analyzing the complexity of algorithms is certainly a useful exercise, but it’s silly to give the impression that we can produce the <em>exact</em> FLOP count. &nbsp;I’m not much of a hardware guy, but I at least know that modern CPUs are stupendously complex, and any FLOP count we can write down on paper after inspecting pseudocode has no chance at being “exact” in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Besides the overall futility of these exercises, we are instructed to&nbsp;consider each of the following operations as a&nbsp;baseline of “1 FLOP”: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root. &nbsp;As we will see shortly, these operations are not even close to equivalent in terms of real-world computational expense, so it’s misleading to count these all as&nbsp;equal atoms&nbsp;of computation.</p>

<p>Anyways… on one recent assignment we were asked to look at the FLOP count for some technique that used a rotation matrix. &nbsp;As you might expect for rotation-y stuff, the matrix entries were based on various trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, arctan). &nbsp;I was in a rush when doing the assignment, so I casually assigned 1 FLOP to each of these trig functions. &nbsp;I felt partially justified in doing this, as I had <a href="http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/" target="_blank">just learned</a> that these trig functions are in fact offered as single CPU instructions in modern Intel x86. &nbsp;Given that we were glossing over so much already, it seemed excusable&nbsp;to consider as atomic anything that can theoretically be done in a single CPU instruction. Regardless, I was&nbsp;docked points. Hmph.</p>

<p>OK fine, I’m not&nbsp;worried about the points, but now I’m&nbsp;curious about how expensive these operations really are. &nbsp;If “square root” qualifies as 1 FLOP, is it really so wrong to lump in “sine” as 1 FLOP, too?</p>

<h4 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h4>

<p>I dusted off the C++ region of my brain, and hacked up the following test program. It was fun to (ab)use macros heavily here.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;

    void reset() { beg_ = clock_::now(); }
    double elapsed() const {
        return duration_cast&lt;second_&gt;
            (clock_::now() - beg_).count();
    }

private:
    typedef high_resolution_clock clock_;
    typedef duration&lt;double, ratio&lt;1&gt;&gt; second_;
    time_point&lt;clock_&gt; beg_;
};

int main(char* argv)
{
    double total;
    Timer tmr;

#define randf() ((double) rand()) / ((double) (RAND_MAX))
#define OP_TEST(name, expr)               \
    total = 0.0;                          \
    srand(42);                            \
    tmr.reset();                          \
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++) { \
        double r1 = randf();              \
        double r2 = randf();              \
        total += expr;                    \
    }                                     \
    double name = tmr.elapsed();          \
    printf(#name);                        \
    printf(" %.7f\n", name - baseline);

    // time the baseline code:
    //   for loop with no extra math op
    OP_TEST(baseline, 1.0)

    // time various floating point operations.
    //   subtracts off the baseline time to give
    //   a better approximation of the cost
    //   for just the specified operation
    OP_TEST(plus, r1 + r2)
    OP_TEST(minus, r1 - r2)
    OP_TEST(mult, r1 * r2)
    OP_TEST(div, r1 / r2)
    OP_TEST(sqrt, sqrt(r1))
    OP_TEST(sin, sin(r1))
    OP_TEST(cos, cos(r1))
    OP_TEST(tan, tan(r1))
    OP_TEST(atan, atan(r1))
    OP_TEST(exp, exp(r1))

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>Compiling this benchmark non-optimized (so that nothing gets erased or rearranged) and running on my Intel Core i7 machine, I get the following results. &nbsp;I’ve normalized so results are relative to the cost of “plus.”</p>

<p><img src="https://latkin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FLOPchart1.png" alt="benchmark results"></p>

<p>So&nbsp;of the “1 FLOP” operations, it turns out&nbsp;division and square root are really about 4x and 6x as expensive, respectively, as the baseline of addition.&nbsp;Trig functions appear to land somewhere in the 15x-20x range, and exp about 10x.</p>

<p>So yes, trig functions&nbsp;really are significantly more expensive than +-*√ (though it still seems a bit arbitrary to count sqrt&nbsp;and division as 1 FLOP).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Measuring the productivity of most professions is exceptionally challenging. Would you measure a lawyer’s productivity by the number of cases they close? Or a doctor’s productivity by the number of operations they perform?</p><p>Moving to the software engineering realm, should your company start measuring lines of code produced by engineers? Please no. How about pull requests per engineer? Nah. Sprint velocity on the company level? 😬</p><p>While it may be tempting to get started with these metrics, resist the temptation. These metrics reward output, people who put in immense amounts of busywork. Another issue with these metrics is that they create unhealthy team dynamics - your company won’t be more successful if teams compete internally, save that energy for competitors. Instead, your productivity metrics should focus on outcomes.</p><p>I’ve tried to summarize my thoughts on the company, team and individual levels.</p><h2 id="Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level"><a href="#Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level" title="Driving business outcomes on the company level"></a>Driving business outcomes on the company level</h2><p>Let’s take a look at a recent study, the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a> and to what conclusions Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim arrived after four years of research. They identified the following key performance indicators of high performing engineering organizations: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore and change-fail percentage. Let’s take a look at them, one by one.</p><p><strong>Lead time</strong> is the amount of time it takes for the engineering teams to ship a feature, end-to-end. While it may be challenging to do this across the board (as features will differ in scope), you can simplify it a bit, and define it as the time it takes someone from opening a pull-request till deploying it to production.</p><p><strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is more straightforward, as the name suggests, it represents the number of production deployments over a given period.</p><p><strong>Mean time to restore</strong> represents the amount of time it takes to restore service, once you had an outage.</p><p><strong>Change-fail percentage</strong> tells you what percentage of your deployments result in an outage that you have to restore.</p><p>The beauty of these metrics is that they are relatively simple to track. I bet you are already using some CI/CD pipelines, so the deployment frequency is given. Mean time to restore and change-fail percentage is something that your post-mortem meetings should already record. Without question, the most challenging metric here is around lead-times: it will be a compound metric that you’ll derive from code review times, CI build times and deployment times.</p><blockquote><p>While the mean time to restore and change-fail percentage metrics may seem like purely reliability metrics, they are not. The worse those indicators are, the more time engineers will spend on incidents and less on features that your customers are paying for.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Team-health-metrics"><a href="#Team-health-metrics" title="Team health metrics"></a>Team health metrics</h2><p>I believe that candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive, high-functioning team. Managers, whether they are front-line managers or above, play a crucial role in creating a feedback culture: a culture where every employee feels safe and comfortable providing feedback to other members of the team, or of that of the broader organization.</p><p>While trust is not simple to measure either, anonymous surveys can help with it. By doing surveys for your teams regularly, you can also keep track of your progress in different areas (trust is just one of them).</p><p>Questions like these (well, more like statements that people have to agree or disagree with) might give you some idea of how you, as a manager, do when it comes to building trust:</p><ul><li>“My manager proactively solicits feedback.”</li><li>“My manager creates a safe environment, built on trust and respect.”</li><li>“I can communicate openly with my manager and my team about our work, even when I disagree.”</li></ul><p>Other areas you might want to gauge are vision, alignment, learning and adapting. Questions like this may be useful:</p><ul><li>“My manager learns from mistakes.”</li><li>“My manager acts on the feedback they receive.”</li><li>“My manager communicates how our team contributes to the company’s overall mission.”</li></ul><p>Please note that while this section focuses on team health, most of the questions are about the team’s manager. The reason for that is because most team members will try to model their behavior based on their manager. The manager’s actions have a profound effect on what the team will treat as desired, accepted or discouraged behaviors.</p><h2 id="Competencies-for-individuals"><a href="#Competencies-for-individuals" title="Competencies for individuals"></a>Competencies for individuals</h2><p>So far, we’ve covered what productivity metrics may look like on the company and team level: let’s take a look at how productivity can be measured on the individual level.</p><p>In my opinion, the work engineers have to do is way too complex to be measured by a single metric, like the number of pull requests an engineer opens, or the number of RFC they write. No metric can do justice in trying to capture the real work. So why bother?</p><p>Instead, engineering productivity should be measured against career ladders (tracks). What’s common in the career ladders most companies have, is that they identify a handful of critical competencies and behaviors that the company values and rewards. <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progression.fyi</a> has a good collection of open-sourced career ladders that you can look at. One of the reasons most companies should have an easily accessible and discoverable career ladder is because it helps set the expectations for both engineers and managers on what’s expected of them, and what they need to achieve to advance in their career at their current company.</p><p>Okay, but what does it have to do with engineering productivity? Everything. Creating a career ladder is the perfect opportunity for setting the example of a productive engineer for each level. As a manager, you’ll have a clear set of expectations and standards for each level, which helps you coach team members, whether they are struggling in their current role, or if they are preparing for a promotion.</p><hr><p>This is far from everything, but it summarizes what I’ve been thinking about the topic in the past couple of months. What are your thoughts on the subject? Please share them in the comments section below!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In today’s, in the past and probably in the future world — the time is more valuable than money, and the right time waits for no one. Hence, we have to make the most out of it to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Time is an extremely scarce resource.</p>
<p><strong>Every one of us has 24*60=1440 minutes a day, and totally about 28000 days to live</strong> (that’s how many days an average person lives since being born). And by the time you read this, you may have already lost significant chunk!</p>
<p>Developers can organize their day, maintain a busy schedule, feel very bored and unfulfilled, and never have enough time. Why so? Because often, the tasks they are doing throughout their day do not excite them or align with what they want—their goals and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t work towards your dreams and goals, you aren’t investing your time in yourself—you are wasting it.</strong></p>
<p>Wasting time is a choice, and it’s one that is entirely within your control. It is really important to make this choice on purpose (and not accidentally) and use your time effectively.</p>
<p>That’s why you should try to make each minute of each day count because every minute you sit idly doing nothing or wasting time, there is someone out there working hard towards the same goal gaining the edge over you.</p>
<p>Moreover, making better use of your time is also saving time. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively and productively because I procrastinated a lot in the past.</p>
<p>And here are some straightforward strategies that you can use to utilize your time better and feel much more fulfilled, energized, and happier:</p>
<h2 id="-set-goals">🎯 Set goals</h2>
<p>When you have goals you want to achieve, you are less likely to waste time on things not related to those goals: everything you do starts feeling that it has a purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If nobody told you today... You have a purpose and never give up on your goals.</p>— GOOD JOB LARRY 🍊 (@LarryJuneTFM) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarryJuneTFM/status/1278045173629349888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Besides, <strong>it’s crucial to establish processes and systems to achieve those goals!</strong></p>
<p>A process is a step-by-step action that helps you efficiently and systematically reach your goals. Not having a process is worse than not having a plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-prioritize-things">💎 Prioritize things</h2>
<p>Most developers have thousands of things (projects!!!) going on at any one time. The key is to focus only on what matters the most to move you toward your big goal.</p>
<p>You should align your time with your big picture priority. Everything else should go on the do-not-do-list! <a href="https://www.inc.com/jory-mackay/warren-buffetts-personal-pilot-reveals-billionaires-brilliant-method-for-prioritizing.html">Here is how Warren Buffet approaches it.</a></p>
<p><em>“It’s said that a wise person learns from his mistakes. A wiser one learns from others’ mistakes. But the wisest person of all learns from others’ successes.”— John C. Maxwell</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-say-no">🙅‍♀️ Say “No”</h2>
<p>Here I am still in the development process, but it has already become much better. I say “no” much more often today.</p>
<p>When I have inquiries of any kind or even my own project ideas, I always reflect on this principle: <strong>if you say yes to this, you automatically say no to something else.</strong> Because you can only do one thing at a time, is this thing more important than other things for achieving my goals?</p>
<p>This way, whole kinds of projects or requests fall through the grid—the filter which recognizes what really matters for me, for my most critical resource—my time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-less-calls-less-meetings">📆 Less calls, less meetings</h2>
<p>Time is an incredibly valuable asset in a product company, and especially in a startup business. When you spend the day sprinting from meeting to meeting, the time flies by.</p>
<p>In fact, most meetings are pointless. Some people like to attend meetings for the sake of meetings. Hence, you could cancel 70%-80% or more of them, making no difference in your work.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you schedule meetings for your developers every few hours the only way they make progress is if they don’t pay attention to the meeting at all.</p>— Frank Wiles (@fwiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/fwiles/status/1245718151607828489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Meetings might interrupt the workflow of individual contributors like developers and designers who need to concentrate for extended periods to deliver tangible value for the product. As a result, the working day of developers can turn into a long evening spending in front of the laptop while trying to mark some of those overdue items off their TODO-list.</p>
<p>Still, meetings are an essential function of communication on the team; that’s why it’s crucial to decide whether every scheduled meeting is worth your time before joining it.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="-time-for-emails">📬 Time for emails</h2>
<p>I don’t answer all emails immediately. I have a fixed time limit for emails; usually, I look at them just once per day, because answering emails and dealing with Slack/Teams messages can be scheduled just like everything else.</p>
<p>The power of time blocking for emails comes in choosing when you do this task instead of disturbing your focus and decreasing your productivity every moment of your day.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mayooshin.com/time-blocking-elon-musk-manage-time/">Elon Musk uses the time blocking method to go through “critical emails” each day.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-automate-things">🤖 Automate things</h2>
<p><strong>We are programmers; we naturally don’t like routine and doing repetitive tasks.</strong> If it happens to us twice or more, we are looking for ways to automate it.</p>
<p>Especially in finance, this can be important. For example, automatic tracking of your expenses is one thing that can lead to financial freedom; it can be used to reduce our spending by tracking our expenses to free more cash from your dev-salary monthly investment.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="-be-in-the-moment">🚀 Be in the moment</h2>
<p>Thinking about the past is pointless. Our whole life is ruining because we think much more about the past and future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can forget about the present.</p>
<p><strong>The “now” is more important than anything:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you can do now, rather than what you can do in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you have now and what you could do with the thing you have now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain.”―Louis Tomlinson</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-dont-swap-money-for-time">📊 Don’t swap money for time</h2>
<p>And also don’t overspend money on useless things. <strong>Because the more you spend, the more time you need to recover this resource.</strong></p>
<p>Our income is indeed limited by time. Basically, we trade in 8-10 hours/day for income and have to wait years before obtaining the necessary job promotion with a fair chance that we may not get that promotion.</p>
<p>That’s why it is necessary to stop swapping money for the time by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Changing your mindset around earning and spending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building an asset that scales (like a side project that will bring passive income)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your “passive” money  and savings to make you more money—start investing or growing your side hustle</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://ilonacodes.com/financial-tips-for-freeing-extra-money-for-investment/">There are so many different ways to free money for investments without overworking or thinking of getting another job.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-ignore-distractions">⚡️ Ignore distractions</h2>
<p>We live in a modern world where it is incredibly easy to get distracted, for example, via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Such interruptions cost not only precious productive hours but also valuable effort and energy. Instead, <strong>invest your time in more important things that will make you closer to your goals and dreams.</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how to prevent distractions and sharpen your focus by reading the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324560">“7 Proven Strategies for Overcoming Distractions”</a> article.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-stop-letting-other-peoples-opinions-control-you">🤯 Stop letting other people’s opinions control you</h2>
<p>When you have to formulate your actions according to others, it actually wastes a lot of time too.</p>
<p>It can prevent you from doing the things you want to do or being who you truly are. Basically, you will tie yourself to the yo-yo of what other people think of you.</p>
<p><em>“The trouble is you think you have time.” – Buddha</em></p>
<p>You have better things to care about than the opinions of others on you because life gives us enough to deal with as is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Time is the most valuable asset you own. Once it is gone, it is gone.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p><strong>Invest your time into making yourself a more knowledgeable and smart person, working for something that will pay you off today or tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>Become a Pro at time management, stop undervaluing your time, stop swapping it actively for money, and instead start investing your time into a variety of assets, including yourself.</p>
<p>Soon you will be able to have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357">the 4-Hour Workweek.</a></p>

        <p>Giving product demos can be stressful and overwhelming. You need to focus on the software, your presentation and keep your potential client's needs at the front of your mind. These tips help me stay focused and deliver a confident and professional demo.</p><h3 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h3><p>The most valuable step you can take to improve your product demos is preparation. I have written a <a href="https://lukelowrey.com/product-demo-checklist/">demo preparation guide</a> that outlines the research, planning and practice techniques that have helped me.</p><h3 id="don-t-go-alone">Don't go alone</h3><p>It is very difficult to maintain your focus and enthusiasm for any presentation longer than half an hour. In my experience it is nearly always best to bring some backup from your team. An extra person can concentrate closely on questions, get a better read on how the demo goes, and give you a chance to catch your breath every now and then.</p><ul><li>Only bring people that will be able to contribute. I have found that using two presenters works well. One person takes control of the software and the other handles the introductions and company overview, and is the first call for questions.</li><li>Each person included in the presentation should be given some space to contribute. It could be as simple as splitting the introduction and demo between you or handing off a standard technical explanation. There is nothing more awkward then sitting through an hour meeting and never having a chance to contribute.</li><li>Try to include people to cover both business and technical expertise.</li></ul><h3 id="be-friendly-but-stick-to-business">Be friendly but stick to business</h3><p>It is very useful to break the ice with your audience before you kick on into the demo. My advice is to keep it simple and brief; you don't want to appear unfriendly but you also need to ensure you have time to show your software in the best light.</p><h3 id="mostly-stick-to-your-plan">Mostly stick to your plan</h3><p>Hopefully you have come prepared with a demo of some high-level user stories and a demo script. A demo where no one says anything is not a good sign but being peppered with questions and never getting into a groove is also an issue. You need to balance answering questions and adapting to the audience's preference with telling the story of your product the way you have planned.</p><ul><li>Let the audience know up front what you are going to show them. It gives them a chance to point out what is important to them and will also give them an idea of what will be shown so they don't need to jump ahead with questions.</li><li>Always describe the software in business terms rather than technical functions. An easy way to remind yourself to do this is starting explanations with <em>"As a [end user type] I can..."</em></li><li>Stop and ask for questions at convenient spots in your presentation. For example, once you have completed some workflow.</li></ul><h3 id="control-your-tempo">Control your tempo</h3><p>A problem that many developers have (including me) when presenting software is moving too fast. When you know the product well and have a time limit it is easy to blow through every function of the software at a million miles an hour.</p><ul><li>Don't try to show everything. You should spend the most time on your product's strongest features; no need to open every page.</li><li>Deliberately pause at key discussion points. I normally mark these in my demo script. You want to leave on the screen interesting, strong features of the product as you pause and make your point. </li><li>When you pause, take your hands completely off the keyboard and mouse. This is your cue to look at the camera or audience and speak using hand gestures.</li><li>Go easy on the mouse. Try not to dart your mouse all over the screen. An annoying habit I need to be aware of is flicking my mouse all around the button I am talking about. Slow your mouse movement down and take your hand off completely when you talk.</li></ul><h3 id="tips-for-presenting-remotely-over-video">Tips for presenting remotely over video</h3><figure><img src="https://lukelowrey.com/content/images/2020/05/demo-screen.png"><figcaption>Example remote demo screen setup</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Prepare your software and desktop. Get your product setup in its own window or tabs. Close down your chat app, email and anything else that could pop something embarrassing onto the screen.</li><li>Share as little as possible. If you are demoing a web application, stick to the web browser. As above you want to limit the chance of oversharing.</li><li>Keep your script on screen. If you have a big monitor and can limit your screen sharing to a single window it is very useful to keep your notes visible to the side of the main demo.</li><li>Get the right window size and zoom level. With a big widescreen monitor sharing Fullscreen is not always the best option. Play around with window size and zoom level before the demo to find a good fit.</li><li>Open by stating <em>"We are looking at the homepage..."</em> this should prompt someone to interrupt your screenshare is not working and is more natural than <em>"can everyone see this?"</em></li><li>Make sure you look at the camera. I have a habit of watching my own video feed when presenting. Because of this I tend to move my video to just below my webcam to ensure I am always facing the camera.</li><li>Try a custom virtual background. For a simple, branded background try <a href="https://www.actionablebackground.com/">actionablebackground.com</a>. If you know the audience well or have a nice office, I don't think this is necessary.</li></ul><h3 id="tips-for-presenting-in-person">Tips for presenting in person</h3><ul><li>Try to position yourself at the front of a meeting room (in front of the big screen) facing toward the audience.</li><li>Pausing is your cue to look around and make eye contact. It is also a good way to encourage questions from your audience.</li><li>Always assume the presentation equipment will be missing the cables and adaptors you need. Bring your own.</li><li>As above, have a backup internet source ready to go.</li></ul><hr><p><em>If you enjoyed the post, like or retweet the thread on twitter.</em></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My presentation tips for running software demos<a href="https://t.co/PaikSK4ZU3">https://t.co/PaikSK4ZU3</a></p>— Luke Lowrey (@lukencode) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukencode/status/1270468261138714626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Logging isn't cheap, so we often disable debug level logs (and lower) when we deploy our code to production. When things are going well, this isn't an issue. But when an error log pops up, much of the context around what was happening in the code is missing. A single line about the stack trace often just isn't enough. It'd be pretty nice to have a more detailed picture of what was happening at the time of failure. If only we had turned on those debug and trace logs.</p>
<p>Well, there's a reason we don't. Simply put, it's expensive. Often, there's an order of magnitude more debug and trace level logs than all other logging levels combined. So if we were to log it all, we'd have to spend multiples more.</p>
<p>We have to choose between a bad option and a worse option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't debug log and miss the crucial context when an error occurs</li>
<li>Log everything and pay up</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where most conversations around this end. Option 2 is a non-starter so we go option 1. If an error pops up we try to replicate the bug locally with debugging on and work from there.</p>
<h2>Using A Ring Buffer</h2>
<p>Luckily, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>. We have a third option. Use a ring buffer to store debug logs and flush it when an error occurs.</p>
<p>This technique is conceptually simple. It takes just a sentence to describe, and not much has changed about the way things are logged. We still use the same logging libraries and the same logging software patterns, but now we have access to far more information in our logs when things go wrong.</p>
<p>You can have your cake and eat it too. You can avoid logging verbosely while at the same time having access to those verbose logs when it matters.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Say that we're building a Django backend for our online widget store, and say that there's a bug somewhere in
the pseudo code below.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>handle_order_post_request</span><span>(</span>req<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  customer <span>=</span> get_customer<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>not</span> is_authorized_customer<span>(</span>customer<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> HttpStatusUnauthorized<span>(</span><span>)</span>

  orders <span>=</span> get_orders<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  verify_prices<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 
  verify_inventory<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 

  checkout_info <span>=</span> process_order<span>(</span>order<span>)</span>
  save_checkout<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> HttpStatusOk<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>


<span>def</span> <span>process_order</span><span>(</span>orders<span>:</span> List<span>[</span>OrderItems<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> CheckoutInfo<span>:</span>
  logger<span>.</span>debug<span>(</span><span>"total price: %d"</span><span>,</span> order<span>.</span>price<span>)</span>

  total_price <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>order<span>.</span>price <span>for</span> order <span>in</span> orders<span>]</span><span>)</span>

  most_expensive_item <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span>
    orders<span>,</span> key<span>=</span><span>lambda</span> order<span>:</span> order<span>.</span>price
  <span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> CheckoutInfo<span>(</span>
    total_price<span>,</span>
    most_expensive_item<span>,</span>
  <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We've launched our widget store, and it's a hit. The widgets our flying off the shelves. Things are going
great but every once in a while our backend errors and a would-be customer leaves our site unhappy.
Without ring buffer logging, here are the logs.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is null</code></pre></div>
<p>Something is going wrong, but what is it? with just a single line error it's difficult to tell what's going
wrong even if we had the stack trace. However, if we had all the contextual debug logs we'd have far more
useful information:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>DEBUG get_orders<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> number of orders: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_prices<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> prices changes: <span>1</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_inventory<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> items out of stock: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG total_price<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> total price: <span>0.0</span>
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is None</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we see a more full picture of the story. The transaction began by processing two orders from the customer. One
of the prices were updated, but both items were out of stock.</p>
<p>Aha! when items were out of stock, they were removed from the checkout meaning that there was no most expensive
item since the list was empty. Now we know what to do to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Now, this example isn't enough to tell you whether or not ring buffer logging is worth it for your codebase. I'm not going
to make an argument telling you what you should be doing when I have no context in what you deal with. But I definitely do
recommend playing around with it to see if it works for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-53">
	

	
	<div>
		
<p>In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Beginning of Infinity, (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359" target="_blank">The Beginning of Infinity,</a> David Deutsch proposes that the creation of knowledge encoded in genes is similar to the creation of knowledge by people. Knowledge creation involves two phases. It starts with mutations, changes or errors in the replication of the DNA sequence, which are similar to our creative leaps or conjectures. This resembles the creative or brainstorming phase. Next, via natural selection, mutations or variations are selected for in order to survive particular environments. This resembles the competitive or argumentative phase. It involves selection of specific ideas among all the conjectures we have come up with. Let’s call the first phase hypothesis generation (mutations/variations) and the second phase truth filtration (natural selection).</p>



<p>The first phase requires a high velocity of creative, surprising ideas. The second phase requires a careful, reasonable breakdown of these ideas. Contributions to the first phase involve creativity at best and fraud at worst. Contributions to the second phase involve thoroughness at best and pessimism at worst. We need both.</p>



<p>This essay talks about the first phase, where what matters is that which is surprising. A mutation is a mutation only if it is different from the original, expected sequence; in other words, a surprise. One of the ideas in information theory, which underlies modern computing, is that information is surprise. What disseminates through Twitter is what is surprising. You scroll through the mundane and pause at the surprising. Billion dollar start-ups were surprising ideas. Investments that generated high returns were surprising. If they weren’t surprising, other people would have started these companies or invested in these ideas and then they would not have had outlier outcomes. Economic growth is surprising because it primarily relies on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf" target="_blank">flow of new ideas</a>. Stand-up comedy that works is surprising. One of the theories on laughter is that we laugh when we are surprised. </p>



<p>All these also need to be “true” in some sense, but they have to be surprising to begin with because if they weren’t, they would be arbitraged away, either emotionally (e.g. Twitter, stand-up) or financially (e.g. start-ups, investing). We crave surprise, however, we want it in appropriate doses. Sociologist Murray Davis said in one of his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="papers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004839317100100211" target="_blank">papers</a> that if an idea questions one of your weakly held beliefs, you accept it as interesting. If it questions one of your strongly held beliefs, you dismiss it as insane. (I think that if an idea is completely new and doesn’t wrestle with any of your beliefs, you might not notice it.)</p>



<p>What helps the first phase, hypothesis generation, is typically different from what helps the second phase, truth filtration. Truth filtration comes from peer review, markets, experiments, and democracy. It requires criticism, devil’s advocacy, error correction, and honesty. On the other hand, hypothesis generation requires coddling, encouragement, and a suspension of belief. It requires an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a>-like “yes and” rather than “no but”. It tends to come from solitude or small groups (e.g. Einstein, Satoshi Nakomoto, start-ups) because most large groups devolve into devil’s advocacy.</p>



<p>We have many institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for truth filtration. We can instinctually argue the other side when someone shares an idea. Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News are all suited for truth filtration; users are quick to call out BS or offer counterarguments. Cunningham’s Law is a good articulation of this – “the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” Mutations are “wrong” in some sense and most will never be selected for, however, they need to be encouraged to reach their potential before weeding them out. So while society has a plethora of mechanisms in place for truth filtration, it has poor institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for hypothesis generation.</p>



<p>Some significant, especially new, ideas may begin as tentative hesitations. In Jony Ive’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="eulogy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGI76__sSA" target="_blank">eulogy</a> of Steve Jobs, he said, “He (Jobs) better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily squished.” Solitude is a good starting point, but discussions with people add creative value – they make your mind race in interesting directions. Improv is a good framework to think about what helps hypothesis generation. The key elements of improv are listening, trying to find ways to make an idea work, and being present. We should have a few institutions and emotional responses that help respond to a new hypothesis by assuming that this is our new reality and running with it. These ideas are like newborn babies; they are too young to be killed with criticism, even if that is honestly what we think about doing at that moment.</p>



<p>In the first phase, anyway, truth does not matter as much as surprise. Instead of, “why could this be wrong?” a good response would be, “in what worldview could this be right?”. This involves suspending your belief for a moment and, like an improv artist, uncompromisingly building on what the other person is thinking and feeling. It is a pure engagement with the idea without bringing in how many other people have tried it before and failed. It is a fantasy world in which this idea is new, original, and deserving of being explored to its fullest potential. You want the hypothesis generator to leave the discussion feeling energized and with a fuller version of her idea.</p>



<p>Improv isn’t about mere agreement. Many times, agreement is as boring as disagreement. When someone says A, the typical response is “yes, A!” or “not A!”. A better response would be “if A is true, then B” or “why A?” or “A adds to C, which this other person proposed”. Improv involves deeply empathizing with an idea, identifying its premise, and then taking that premise in an interesting direction. A good response to A can’t just be B if B is unrelated, but B is a good response if you use the premise in A to get to B. When someone proposes A, we often think that the purpose of the conversation is to decide between A and not A. But A can lead to B, C, D, E, and an infinite number of other options, so merely agreeing or disagreeing with something exploratory isn’t as interesting.</p>



<p>In practice, it may be difficult in some cases to separate hypothesis generation and truth filtration. The process of creating knowledge is fluid; we are making creative leaps as we are discovering what is true. However, there are ideas for which this is clearer. The improv approach is suitable for early, exploratory ideas; for example, “what if everything is priced in life years?” or “maybe we can replace cars with …”. It isn’t suitable for long-drawn, argumentative ideas like “abortion should be legal”, “free will doesn’t exist”, “Seinfeld is better than Friends”, “intelligence isn’t inherited”, etc.</p>



<p>What’s misleading about the phrase “truth filtration” is that while we might think that we are filtering for truth, sometimes we are not creative enough to understand that something is true. Stewart Brand put it well – “Reality is routinely stranger than fiction because reality has no obligation to sound plausible.” Also, sometimes we might just be focused on winning an argument instead of finding the truth. Winning an argument often involves disproving the other side’s weakest point, while finding the truth involves trying to disprove your strongest point. It would be nice to have a platform with the thoughtfulness of Hacker News but that thoughtfulness put to build on rather than reject exploratory ideas.</p>



<p>Hypothesis generation is important because without mutations or creative leaps, there would be nothing for evolution to select for. We need more institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses that encourage creative leaps; we need some version of improv for ideas.</p>

    <div>
        <p>I have been working on a custom <a href="https://lukelowrey.com/ghostsolo">Ghost theme</a> to power my blog (you are looking at an early version right now!). One thing I wanted to have a crack at was a dark/light theme switcher. It turns out with modern CSS this is pretty straight forward.</p><p>The approaches I considered were:</p><ul><li>CSS classes set on the &lt;body&gt;</li><li>Switch out style sheet entirely</li><li>CSS variables</li></ul><p>I went with CSS variables because my blog audience tends to be on the latest browser versions so I don't need to worry much about browser support (<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">not that it is too bad</a>). </p><h3 id="using-css-variables-for-themes">Using CSS variables for themes</h3><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables</a> are properties you can set in your stylesheets that can be used in later styles. They are similar to tools such as SASS but built directly into CSS. This makes them very well suited for theming.</p><p>This is a simplified snippet from the default variables used in my theme <a href="https://lukelowrey.com/ghostsolo">GhostSolo</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>:root {
    --background-color: #fff;

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The :root selector is the default set of values.

a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    filter: brightness(80%);
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In my theme I have variables for a couple of key style choices to allow distinct colour themes beyond dark/light. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>:root {

Near the end, I’ll have a full-blown linear scan register allocator written in OCaml. If you want to follow along, you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Heasummn/ocaml_reg_alloc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-register-allocation">What is Register Allocation?<a href="#what-is-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I/O is slow. It is ridiculously slow. Reading from RAM takes about 50-100ns, reading from a register takes approximately 300ps. That is a difference of 3 orders of magnitude. When you’ve got a program that requires every ounce of speed it can have, storing values in registers rather than RAM would result in a 1000x speedup. As compiler developers, it is our job to make sure that we are making full use of the registers available to us.</p><p>Register Allocation is a very interesting problem that arises in compiler development. How do we make the best use of registers while maintaining correctness?</p><h2 id="vocabulary-and-concepts">Vocabulary and Concepts<a href="#vocabulary-and-concepts" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>There are a ton of resources talking about register allocation out there, but a lot of them don’t stop and clarify the vocabulary that is being used. If you’re just looking for code samples, you can skip past this section.</p><h3 id="statement-ordering">Statement Ordering<a href="#statement-ordering" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Programs are trees, yet when talking about register allocation, we talk about the program as a sequence of statements. This is something that is often just glossed over and to be fair, it’s not very complex, but it’s not obvious either. We need some way of converting an AST into a sequence of statements that maintain dependencies. This is called a <strong>reverse postordering</strong> and is easily derived from a DFS. Most register allocation algorithms are applied per basic block, but can also be applied globally.</p><h3 id="liveness">Liveness<a href="#liveness" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>We say that a variable is <em>alive</em> if it is being used. We can represent this pretty easily using an array of start and endpoints, also known as <strong>live ranges</strong>. Register allocation becomes messy and a lot slower when using ranges, so instead we like to talk about just the start and endpoint of a variable’s life, also known as <strong>live intervals</strong>. We use liveness analysis when allocating registers, but it is also useful for type checking and some common optimizations, so computing the intervals is essentially “free”.</p><h3 id="spilling">Spilling<a href="#spilling" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Say we have 4 registers in our system and 5 variables that are alive at the same time. It is impossible to fit 5 gallons into a 4-gallon container, so we are out of luck. That won’t stop us though, we’re going to spill a variable. Spilling is the act of saving a variable into memory, rather than storing it in a register. To rephrase what we were saying earlier, we want a register allocation algorithm that minimizes unnecessary spilling. How do we choose which variable should be spilled though?</p><h3 id="heuristic">Heuristic<a href="#heuristic" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>There is no correct answer to the question we posed above. In a more positive tone, any answer is correct. We will choose something called a <strong>spilling heuristic</strong>, which is just how we decide which variable gets spilled. In linear scan register allocation, the algorithm that I’ll demonstrate in just a moment, the most common heuristic is to spill the variable that “dies” the latest.</p><h3 id="graph-coloring">Graph Coloring<a href="#graph-coloring" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Graph coloring is the problem of giving each vertex in a graph a different color (from some fixed set of colors) than any of its neighbors. This is not a “compiler problem”, but it was discovered that register allocation can be simplified to graph coloring. If we draw a graph with every single variable as a vertex and an edge between them if they are alive at the same time, we get a <strong>register inference graph</strong>, which we can then color with the registers available to us. The only problems are that some graphs cannot be colored and graph coloring is NP-complete and computationally expensive. There is a clever algorithm developed by <strong>Chaitin et al.</strong> that handles spilling in reasonable time. I will not be going over the algorithm, but send me a message if you’re interested.</p><h2 id="linear-scan-register-allocation">Linear Scan Register Allocation<a href="#linear-scan-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I promised code, let’s get to that code. From <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs132/linearscan.pdf" target="_blank">their 1999 paper</a> Poletto and Sarkar devised a ridiculously simple and clever algorithm for register allocation. We greedily assign and free registers until we can’t fit them in anymore, which is when we spill.</p><p>Linear scanning is ridiculously fast, but as you may have guessed, it does not produce optimal code. When <code>ocamlc</code> added an option for linear scanning, they saw compile-time improvements of almost 25%. The difference in performance between Chaitin’s algorithm and linear scanning is so minuscule that for a lot of applications it does not matter, but we like as much performance as we can have. Linear scanning is used most often in JITs, like Oracle’s Hotspot, because compilation speed matters a ton. This is the basic algorithm:</p><pre><code data-lang="none">LinearScanRegisterAllocation
    active ← {}
    for each live interval i, in order of increasing start point do
        ExpireOldIntervals(i)
        if length(active) = R then
            SpillAtInterval(i)
        else
            register[i] ← a register removed from pool of free registers
            add i to active, sorted by increasing end point

ExpireOldIntervals(i)
    for each interval j in active, in order of increasing end point do
        if endpoint[j] ≥ startpoint[i] then
            return
        remove j from active
        add register[j] to pool of free registers

SpillAtInterval(i)
    spill ← last interval in active
    if endpoint[spill] &gt; endpoint[i] then
        register[i] ← register[spill]
        location[spill] ← new stack location
        remove spill from active
        add i to active, sorted by increasing end point
    else
        location[i] ← new stack location
</code></pre><p>We enter the algorithm with all of the variables in our code represented as <em>live intervals</em>. In OCaml, we’ll define these to look like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>type</span> interval <span>=</span>

    end_point<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>regs</code> is just an enum containing all the registers that we have. To make life easier for us, let’s define a constructor:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> make_interval name start close <span>=</span>

</code></pre></div><p>To represent our input, we will use a global mutable array. I couldn’t figure out a way to make this completely immutable, but we’ll get pretty close. Once the algorithm is done, we’ll want to have the register or spilled status of each interval in the array.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> intervals <span>=</span> <span>[|</span>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people.

If you want to modify the product, you need to restart the entire process over again. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_633705"><div><h2><strong>Founders &amp; Market</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around a market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around key biology</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_651094"><div><p>In tech, a prototypical founder often worked at the incumbent company or realized a market opportunity by being that market themself.

If anything, older founders may be subconsciously discriminated against in favor for younger founders. </p><p>In biotech, the prototypical founder is older, often a career CEO or exec coming out of a Big Pharma company. At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing.

Bifurcated markets can be especially dangerous as companies compete on pricing and ‘race to the bottom’.</p><p>In biotech, the markets are <em>so </em>large, and the unmet need so high, that there can and often are many winners in one market (disease). The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug.

			<h2>On 15th July, Ben Arc published in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/an-open-letter-to-yanis-varoufakis-about-bitcoin">Bitcoin Magazine</a> an open letter addressed to me in a bid to convince me that I should re-assess my rejection of Bitcoin as a force for good; as a bulwark for democratising capitalism and paving the ground for socialism. Here is my reply:</h2>
<h3>Dear Ben Arc,</h3>
<h3>Thank you for your open letter and your efforts to bring a socialist perspective to bear upon my assessment of Bitcoin.</h3>
<h3>In my reply below, I shall address you as a fellow socialist, rather than put together a reply meant to address all sorts of different perspectives (e.g. Keynesian, Hayekian, neoclassical)</h3>
<h3>As you know, I am one of those who, back in 2011, were genuinely intrigued, fascinated even, by the remarkable blockchain algorithm. The prospect of a decentralised ledger controlled by its community of users was mesmerising.</h3>
<h3>As you also know, I was unimpressed by Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat money that is either likely, or indeed desirable, under our current capitalist predicament.</h3>
<h3>Having read your open letter, I remain as enthusiastic on blockchain’s capacities and as unimpressed by Bitcoin’s ability to help us either civilise or (as any socialist dreams of) transcend capitalism.</h3>
<h3>Two propositions support this view. In the hypothetical case where Bitcoin were, under presently-existing capitalism, to replace fiat money: (1) It would lack the mechanism necessary to stop capitalist crises from yielding depressions that benefit only the ultra-right; and, (2) Its community-based, democratic protocols would do little to democratise economic life.</h3>
<h3>I shall explain my two propositions briefly below. But, before you despair (at my continued negative take on Bitcoin), let me foreshadow the concluding sentence in the Epilogue below: Once (and, of course, if) socialism dawns, money will have to be founded on a distributed-ledger, monetary commons enabling tehnology.</h3>
<h3>In other words, I shall argue that Bitcoin is not fit for purpose under capitalism, or as a vehicle toward transcending capitalism, but something like Bitcoin will characterise monetary systems in a future world free of private banks and share markets.</h3>
<h3>OK, let me now support my two propositions:</h3>
<h2><strong><em>Proposition 1: Bitcoin lacks the shock absorbers necessary to prevent capitalist crises from doing untold damage to the working class</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Consider the Crash of 2008 or the more recent 2020 Covid-19-induced crisis. Suppose that Central Banks did not have the capacity instantly to create trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen – and instead had to rely on a spontaneous majority of Bitcoin’s users to agree to a massive increase in the supply of money. The result would be a 1929-like collapse of banks and corporations.</h3>
<h3>While socialists would shed no tears for the tragedy of the oligarchy, socialists should beware that a 1929-like systemic collapse is bound to strengthen the forces of the ultra-right – not of the socialist left (that has been, since at least 1991, languishing in the doldrums of political paralysis).</h3>
<h3>Technically, there is of course nothing that would prevent the Bitcoin community from agreeing instantly to even a doubling of the money base. However, the Tragedy of the Commons guarantees that Bitcoin owners will be subject to the usual prisoner’s dilemma dynamic that prevents the boost in the money supply necessary to avert the liquidation of potentially viable businesses and jobs. Moreover, this free-rider problem is made far, far worse by the fact that Bitcoin ownership is very unequally distributed, thus giving the Bitcoin-rich powerful incentives to restrain the growth of the money supply (since such restrictions would boost their private rents at the expense of the public interest).</h3>
<h3>In short, the free-rider problem that guarantees the maximal reinforcement of any capitalist crisis (in any economy relying on Bitcoin as its main currency) will be turbocharged by the unequal ownership of Bitcoin – which is unavoidable in any monetary system overlaid upon contemporary capitalism.</h3>
<h2><em>Proposition 2: Under capitalism, Bitcoin’s dominance will not democratise economic life – or give socialism a chance</em></h2>
<h3>Suppose, again, that some magic wand is waved and Bitcoin replaces fiat money under contemporary capitalist conditions. In other words, as Bitcoin replaced dollars, pounds, euros and yen, property rights over land, resources and machines remain as they are while private equity firms and pension funds continue to own the bulk of shares trading in Wall Street, the City etc. All that will have changed is that Central Banks will vanish and the community of Bitcoin users will determine the global money supply (subject to the free-rider problems mentioned above).</h3>
<h3>At the firm level, nothing will have changed. Jeff Bezos will still control a massive monopsony-cum-monopoly, Facebook will still own the whole marketplace within its platform, Exxon-Mobil will continue to lean on weaker developing country governments to drill for oil and gas that should be left in the Earth’s guts etc.</h3>
<h3>And what of private banks? They would, make no mistake here, find ways of creating complex derivatives based on Bitcoin – derivatives that will soon (just like Lehman Brothers’ CDOs prior to 2008) function as stores of value and means of exchange; i.e. as private money. Massive bubbles denominated in Bitcoin will build up and they will burst just as they did in the 19<sup>th</sup> century under the Gold Standard. And then?</h3>
<h3>In the absence of Central Banks and with the Bitcoin community in the clasps of the aforementioned free-rider problem, depression will follow – as it did before the Fed was instituted in the US. Thus, the tragedy mentioned in Proposition 1 above kicks in.</h3>
<h3>In short, not only will the democratisation of money via Bitcoin fail to democratise capitalism but it will also give an almighty boost to the forces of regression.</h3>

<h3>Bitcoin’s great appeal is that it breaks the cronyist chain linking central banks and private bankers. However, it does not undermine the cronyism of the network of bosses, politicians and private bankers.</h3>
<h3>Lest we forget, 19<sup>th</sup> Century bimetallic America also lacked a central bank. Under the gold and silver standards, the public money supply was fixed – and could not be easily manipulated by the state (either the government or the, then non-existent, Fed). But that did not stop private bankers from leveraging public money out of thin air to create huge quantities of private money with which to fund the Robber Barons, i.e. the Jeff Bezoses, of the era.</h3>
<h3>In this sense, replacing fiat money with Bitcoin would take us back to a postmodern version of 19<sup>th</sup> Century America – not exactly a prospect socialists should go to the barricades for.</h3>
<h3>In summary, the monetary system is like the dog’s tail. It cannot wag the capitalist dog, in the sense that democratising money by means of a monetary commons will not democratise economic life but, rather, make capitalism uglier, nastier and more dangerous for humanity.</h3>
<h3>Having said all this, a monetary commons (that may very well rely on something like the blockchain underpinning Bitcoin) will, I have no doubt, be an essential aspect of a democratised economy; of socialism.</h3>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to

      <p>Webpack is becoming the standard in bundling JavaScript, but what does that even mean and how does it work?  Let's
find out.</p>

<p>I find the configuration of Webpack hard to understand and derive.  I find the general concept of Webpack very
difficult to grasp, especially when reading the myriad blogs documenting the way to set it up—they are all different!</p>

<p>The source of these problems is that Webpack is a monolithic system that does many unrelated things in an opaque way, while also being designed around extreme flexibility.  Unlike a monolithic framework such as Ruby on Rails, nothing in  Webpack “just works”—you have to provide configuration for Webpack's most basic features to work.</p>

<p>This is part of JavaScript's culture—each new problem in your development environment is viewed as a chance to invent a
solution from first principles and no particular opinion on this is viewed as canonical or idiomatic.  This means we'll be
spending a lot of time in documentation and a lot of time making decisions that have nothing to do with our users or the
problems we're trying to solve for them.</p>

<p>So, let's figure out what even is a Webpack together by starting from nothing.  You'll be amazed at how little JSON you need to
throw at this problem, Medium blog posts be damned!</p>

<h2 id="what-problem-does-webpack-solve">What Problem Does Webpack Solve?</h2>

<p>Webpack exists to give us a feature of JavaScript that exists in most other languages by default - modularization.</p>

<p>As programmers, we want to put code in different files for the purposes of organization.  Said another way, we
don't want all our JavaScript in one file.  We may also wish to use third-party JavaScript libraries to help us.</p>

<p>Because JavaScript <a href="http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2016/01/13/hierarchy-of-software-needs.html">fails to meet many programmer's needs</a>, there has always been a requirement to have some
sort of way to deploy code organized in multiple files to a user's web browser. </p>

<p>The simplest way is to use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag for each file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/address.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/billing.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is hard to maintain, so another way is to concatenate all the files together into one bundle during the build of your
application, and deploy just that bundle to the user's browser.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; find js -name \*.js \
          -exec cat {} \; &gt;&gt; bundle.js
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">the Rails Asset Pipeline</a> effectively does.</p>

<p>This is not good enough for many reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything must be globally scoped, meaning name clashes are hard to avoid, especially when third-party code is involved.</li>
<li>In fact, it's not clear how to use third-party libraries - are they in your bundle, or separate <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags?</li>
<li>You cannot easly use languages that compile down to JavaScript, such as ES6, CoffeeScript, TypeScript or whatever.</li>
<li>Good luck writing unit tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>If only JavaScript had a module system like every other language.  It <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-modules">sorta does</a>, but not in any useful way, because no
browser supports the latest version of JavaScript.  And no browser ever will (since “the latest version of JavaScript“ is a
moving target).</p>



<p>Webpack implements a module system as well as a way to translate JavaScript code that doesn't work in any web browser to
JavaScript code that works in most web browsers.  It's like a C compiler.</p>

<p>It allows you to write code like this, which is remedial in most other modern languages:</p>

<pre><code>// inside main.js
import address from "address";
import billing from "billing";

billing.some_function();
address.some_other_function();
</code></pre>

<p>Webpack allows you to specify that <code>main.js</code> is your main file, and that <code>main.js</code> might contain instructions for locating other files, which Webpack should do, recursively until all needed files have been located. All those files should then be brought together and translated into a single file, suitable for use in a web browser.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, <code>webpack *.js &gt; bundle.js</code> does not do this.  Because the JavaScript ecosystem favors monolithic, do-everything tools, Webpack, in fact, does everything (except what it doesn't—we'll get to that).  It's super flexible, which means it's hard to use, hard to understand, and hard to learn.</p>

<p>I'm going to try to correct that by starting from a very simple case, and building things up, one step at a time, until we have a reasonable development and production environment, while only adding configuration when <strong>there is a problem that needs solving</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="webpack-from-first-principles">Webpack from First Principles</h2>

<p>To install Webpack, you'll need Node, so <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">go install it</a> (you might want to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">use a package manager</a>).  You'll need need a JavaScript library downloader, which used to be only NPM, but now you should use Yarn, so <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">go install it</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; node --version
v12.3.0
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt; yarn --version
1.21.1
</code></pre>

<p>Many tutorials and READMEs tell you to install JavaScript packages willy-nilly.  We aren't going to do that.  We're going to
have a file to keep track of all the stuff our project needs.  That file is <code>package.json</code> and Yarn can create one for us.  This
allows us to recreate our system whenever we want without having to re-execute a bunch of commands.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; yarn -y init
yarn init v1.21.1
success Saved package.json
Done in 0.03s.
warning The yes flag has been set. This will automatically answer yes to all questions, which may have security implications.
</code></pre>

<p>This will create an empty <code>package.json</code> for us.  Now, let's install Webpack!  Note that the CLI is a separate module.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli
</code></pre>

<pre><code>yarn add v1.21.1

Case in point: PhysFS.</p></header><p>Loading screens are pretty cool. They let artists showcase some nice art while the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_qehhZUds">intro theme song</a> starts playing. Used well, they can set up the stage for the eventual play by putting the player in the mood. But that’s only a side effect. Their main purpose is to keep the user busy while your game loads and initialize everything it needs to render the main menu, and possibly more. But after the first hundred or so starts, the experience may get old. Especially if that loading bar seems to be stuck forever.</p><p>Our Grand Strategy titles at Paradox have a reputation to not be on the fast side to load up, especially considering that they are not exactly next-gen graphics games with tens of gigabytes of assets. A couple months back, I decided to take a look at how Clausewitz (our internal engine) loads up stuff and what took so long.</p><p>The answer was interesting: most of the time was spent doing nothing. More precisely, either doing nothing by sleeping on a condition, or burning CPU cycles waiting a boolean to become <code>true</code>. We had a locking problem.</p><h2 id="thread-safe-but-not-thread-efficient">Thread safe, but not thread efficient</h2><p>The big lock contention was on file access. Every read, write, open, close or enumerate ended up locking a mutex or spin lock somewhere. And most of it was not even due to our engine.</p><p>To ease up filesystem access, we rely on a 3rd party library called <a href="https://icculus.org/physfs/">PhysicsFS</a>, or PhysFS. It’s a pretty handy way of mounting several directories and archives under the same logical hierarchy and treat it as one, handling things like priority when resolving names which is crucial to support DLCs and user mods properly. It also supports a variety of platforms and archive formats. But it had one fatal flaw: it’s bad at threading. Really bad.</p><p>Some time ago, my predecessors decided to load up the game data from disk with several concurrent threads. While it was probably efficient at the time, today it had become quite the pain, since PhysFS implements thread safety through <em>one</em> global mutex that is locked on all API calls. Meaning one thread doing a <code>read()</code> would block any other trying to either read, open, close or seek a file (be it the same or another one).</p><div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>stateLock</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>     <span>/* protects other PhysFS static state. */</span>

</code></pre></div></div><p>PhysFS has been there for quite sometime, and at some point an issue was raised about the thread safety of the API, which was resolved by putting a global mutex or two. While probably good enough at the time, it turns out to be a serious performance killer on a modern machine with 8 cores trying to access the filesystem concurrently. In several cases it turned out to be even slower than processing the same data serially in one thread.</p><h2 id="improving-the-threading-model">Improving the threading model</h2><p>Luckily for me, it had been recently decided that we would embed a modified copy of PhysFS in our engine, which made it easier to tinker with it until I had something satisfactory. While I could probably make those changes public, they would have little chance of being accepted mainstream as is, as one of my first decision was to drop usage of C in favour of C++. Instead, I’ll describe here was I did to make our implementation more friendly to threads.</p><p>As I hinted, the first thing I did was to tweak the build (of course!) to have our local fork of PhysFS compiled by a C++ instead of a C compiler. Our engine is entirely built in C++ and there was little reason for me to keep dealing with C in 2020, especially if locks were involved. For example using macros and gotos instead of RAII to ensure proper unlocking on early returns is pure masochism if you ask me.

</span></code></pre></div></div><p>Once that was done, I was able to put all the API state (a few globals) inside a struct that would only be accessed through a RAII accessor that would lock/unlock on construction and destruction. Then I started checking if that state could be split into several sub-structures with each their locks. This allowed me to have a clearer understanding of the data model and where the contention was.</p><p>As it turned out, about 75% of the locking was done to ensure that the filesystem configuration was not changed during pathname resolution. As PhysFS aggregates several mount points under one root (like UNIX <code>mount</code> does), the API needed to lock the list of mount points to protect against data races should another thread mount or unmount a path at the same time.</p><p>The thing is, mounting or unmounting paths is a rare and specific operation. It is usually set up once when the game starts, and only change at very specific places (for example if the game allows to enable/disable mods on the fly). Almost 100% of the calls to <code>mount()</code> and <code>unmount()</code> are done while no other thread is loading as even with locks it would make the result unpredictable. Locking the whole API for that very rare case made no sense for us.</p><p>To solve this I introduced a <code>freeze_config()</code> call in the PhysFS API that would turn the configuration read-only internally. With proper use of <code>const</code> accessors, it allowed me to bypass locking entirely for read accesses to configuration while the freeze flag was set. Any non-const access to the configuration state in that mode would assert or throw an exception to trap the logic error. Since all access to the configuration singleton was now handled by a RAII accessor, it was easy to handle the change at one single point and have the whole PhysFS code behave like I wanted. This reduced the lock contention on FS access drastically, making threaded code actually run in parallel.</p><p>The next lock I got rid off was the error lock. PhysFS keeps track of errors by having a form of <code>errno</code> per thread which is stored inside a linked list of thread id / error code pairs:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>__PHYSFS_ERRSTATETYPE__</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>tid</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PHYSFS_ErrorCode</span> <span>code</span><span>;</span>
    <span>struct</span> <span>__PHYSFS_ERRSTATETYPE__</span> <span>*</span><span>next</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ErrState</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>ErrState</span> <span>*</span><span>errorStates</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>errorLock</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>     <span>/* protects error message list.        */</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>The API offers a way to get a description of the last error encountered on this thread. The canonical solution would have been the change the error reporting entirely, as keeping the last error code as internal state is considered bad form today (for good reasons), and instead ensure each API call would return an error code or exception when used. This would have, of course, required to change the whole API <em>and</em> all the callers.</p><p>Instead, I went for a quicker solution that made the last error code be a <code>thread_local</code> static variable inside PhysFS. This allowed me to get rid of most of the error code storage implementation, as there was no more need to handle a manually implemented linked list or lock anything. Unless the library is used in an environment where threads are really tight on thread local storage (which wasn’t my case), I found it to be a simple and elegant enough solution to the problem.</p><h2 id="a-lock-might-hide-another">A lock might hide another</h2><p>A surprise that came out of my new locking mechanism is that some lower bits of the library were not using any form of synchronization and simply relied on the main API lock to protect against data races. The archive file driver, for instance, shared a bunch of data meaning that two concurrent accesses to files in the same archive could result in a race condition.</p><p>Luckily, it turned out that access to those archive I/O handles were done a very few places so I could easily solve the issue by putting a lock at archive level. I would have searched for a more elegant solution if needed, but it turned that this one lock never showed up in the profiler, so I left it as is.</p><p>Still, that illustrated the fact that putting a global lock may lead to a bunch of unseen potential data races which will appear later once that lock is replaced by a more efficient mechanism, requiring changes in cascade throughout the implementation, down to the lowest levels.</p><p>The final lock I had to remove turned out to be on our side, as apparently someone had encountered an issue with PhysFS thread safety in the past on UNIX platforms and had added another spin lock on the call site of the API to address it. With the entire locking inside PhysFS now handled by <code>std::recursive_mutex</code> and <code>std::atomic</code> I could safely remove it.</p><h2 id="cascading-bottlenecks">Cascading bottlenecks</h2><p>As my readers may know, removing a bottleneck somewhere does not always solve the issue. Quite often, it only makes the next one visible. In my case, the biggest one to show itself after I was done was PhysFS was our asset loading system. Since PhysFS used to perform so poorly, there was little point trying to load some assets in parallel, especially back when our main renderer was DirectX 9.</p><p>Graphics API were historically also bad at threading. For example DirectX 9 isn’t thread safe by default, and the “thread-safe” flag just enables a big mutex, exactly like PhysFS does. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-differences">official documentation</a> recommends to not use it and instead do all API call on one thread. It’s one of the reason a lot of games still use a dedicated “rendering” thread to this date. While there are pros to this approach, the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, I switched all of my hosting from arbitrarily installed packages to Docker. This made installing and configuring incredibly simple, but updating a little less defined. Whilst Docker itself is updated through the system package manager (probably), the containers themselves aren’t.</p><p>Docker container versions are known as “tags”, and unlike regular version numbers, can be reassigned to a different container, meaning containers can be updated inside a version constraint, in much the same way a git tag can move to a different commit. This enables a pretty handy feature, whereby container maintainers can create tags for <code>1.12</code> and keep it up to date with the latest patch version (eg <code>1.12.0</code> - <code>1.12.99</code>). As nice as this is, it also adds a layer of complexity. If you’re noting that you want version <code>1.12</code> of a container, there’s no telling if that’s actually the <em>latest</em> <code>1.12.0</code>. Unfortunately, very few maintainers follow any sane <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> for their tags.</p><p>When you install a docker container, it’s always constrained to a version, which by default is <code>latest</code>. If you just <code>pull</code> all new containers, those pinned to <code>latest</code> will fetch newer versions, but anything pinned to a specific version (<code>1.12.4</code>) won’t be updated.</p><p>So, how can we deal with this?</p><p>Well, the obvious way to deal with this is to just keep on top of your tags. When a new version comes out, update the tag in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, <code>docker-compose pull</code>, and then restart the container (<code>docker-compose down &amp;&amp; docker-compose up -d</code>). This is simple, and robust, and means nothing will update without you knowing.</p><p>The downside is that this is obviously quite a lot of work. There are projects which <a href="https://docker-hub-rss.now.sh/">expose RSS feeds from docker hub</a>, but you’ve still got to go manually update each container and issue a <code>docker-compose pull</code>etc.</p><p>Here are some examples of the changes needed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/commit/452118e2a9f07b802840e34954e4a8ad9074e694">Update Synapse patch version</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/commit/ba486a26e4457214509b8682473280d239036cd4">Update Duplicati LSIO version</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/commit/005cc528b6ace28b70197d1d73afb92443d1a1d7">Update Nextcloud</a></li></ul><h2 id="pin-to-latest"><a href="#pin-to-latest">#</a> Pin to <code>latest</code></h2><p>This method is probably the most like the conventional package manager approach. If you just pin your versions to <code>latest</code>, then you can just periodically pull and restart all containers. Simple, right?</p><p>Well yes, but actually no. Pinning latest is generally considered bad practice unless you don’t actually care which version it’s using. In the event you need to rebuild your infrastructure, there’s no way of knowing which version you were actually running (without looking at the hash of the container), and getting back up and running can be just as annoying.</p><h2 id="watchtower-the-yolo-approach"><a href="#watchtower-the-yolo-approach">#</a> <code>watchtower</code> (the #YOLO approach)</h2><p>Docker doesn’t have an “update all running containers and restart the new ones” command, which is where <code>watchtower</code> comes in. <a href="https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/"><code>watchtower</code></a> is a tool which automatically fetches the newest version of a container, and restarts it for you with the same settings. <code>watchtower</code> won’t change tag for you, it’ll only update if the container under the tag changes.</p><p>By pinning all your containers to <code>latest</code> in combination with using <code>watchtower</code>, you’ll ensure your containers are always up to date 100% of the time. This sounds great, but it’s not. If a package releases a major version and breaking changes, your system will update automatically, perhaps leaving itself in a broken, unrecoverable state. Not something you want to wake up to!</p><h2 id="combination"><a href="#combination">#</a> Combination</h2><p>A more optimal solution is a combination of the above: some containers auto-update, and others are pinned to the versions you need, for when updating isn’t straightforward (eg Nextcloud).</p><p>So, here’s a workflow:</p><ol><li>Pin your containers as you need them, as loosely as you’re comfortable with. If you don’t actually care what version it’s using, and are confident it can update itself, pin <code>latest</code>. If you need a specific patch version for <em>reasons</em>, pin that. If you’re unsure, pin the latest major version, as anything below it shouldn’t have breaking changes, and should be backwards compatible.</li><li>Use <code>watchtower</code> to keep these pins up to date. This ensures <code>latest</code> always means <code>latest</code>, and that specific pins always reflect upstream, which makes rebuilding easier.</li><li>Have some way of knowing when new versions are released. Whether that’s via <a href="https://docker-hub-rss.now.sh/">DockerHub RSS</a>, <a href="https://github.community/t/rss-feeds-for-github-projects/292">GitHub releases</a>, or something else, it doesn’t matter.</li><li>When new versions are released, bump the pinned version in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> (or alike), and re-deploy (<code>pull</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>up -d</code>).</li></ol><p>With this, you’ll have a container setup which reasonably matches the package management workflow you’re used to, with a couple niceties around auto updating. Only the packages you want to automatically update will automatically update, and the rest you can update when you’re notified of updates.</p><h3 id="but-my-container-doesnt-have-sane-versions"><a href="#but-my-container-doesnt-have-sane-versions">#</a> “But my container doesn’t have (sane) versions?”</h3><p>Unfortunately, all of what I’ve said above relies on the container maintainer publishing the relevant tags, in a way which you can keep updated. The official containers are great examples of how <strong>to</strong> do pinning: <code>1</code>, <code>1.12</code>, <code>1.12.3</code> and <code>latest</code> are all available for use and updated, as all containers should be.</p><div><p><code>&lt;rant&gt;</code></p><div><p><a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/">LinuxServer.io</a> maintain a number of really great containers, but don’t maintain these meta versions. You either have to pin to the exact version, including their own versioning (<code>18.0.4-ls81</code>) or <code>latest</code>.</p><p>This makes updating incredibly annoying, and requiring fairly constant updates to ensure the applications work correctly. If you use these containers, and want some slightly better tagging, go show your support: <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder/pull/50">https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder/pull/50</a></p></div><p><code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code></p></div><p>If a container you want to use doesn’t expose pinned versions like this, then there’s little you can do but ask the maintainer to add some more tags.</p><h2 id="concluding"><a href="#concluding">#</a> Concluding</h2><p>Maintaining a docker-based infrastructure is different, especially around updating, but it’s a decision I don’t regret. Mostly because it means I don’t need to care about inter-application compatibility, security or exactly how to run the application, it “just works”.</p><p>If you put in some work to set up notifications about software updates, it’s not too dissimilar to regular package managers, and yet has the nice benefits of keeping some things up-to-date.</p><p>I’ve been running this process for about 6 months, and it’s not caused me a single issue. Whilst there are some packages I need (looking at you <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jenkins-builder/pull/50">LSIO</a>!) which I’ve been forced to pin to <code>latest</code>, the rest remain nicely pinned to versions.</p><p>You can see all of this in action in my <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> repository!</p></div></div>]]>

July 27, 2020 | https://zachwick.com/posts/odh-contact-tracing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://zachwick.com/posts/odh-contact-tracing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        



<p>The Ohio Dept of Health is doing contact tracing as part of their response to COVID-19. When a person tests positive for COVID-19, they provide their local health department with the name and phone number of any recent close contacts. Those close contacts are then contacted by the local health department and are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days and take their temperature twice a day. These close contacts are also asked to self-report their temperatures and any other COVID-19 symptoms that they may have either over the phone to a health department employee or via a web app.</p>

<p>If a person chooses to report their temperature and other symptoms via the web app, they are sent a URL daily at 1600 and then again every 30 minutes until they visit the URL and report their information. These URLs look like the following:</p>
<div><pre>https://octs.odh.ohio.gov/symptom-tracker?p=T0RILTI5ODI1&amp;d=MDcvMTMvMjAyMA%3D%3D&amp;language=en</pre></div>
<p>This was the URL that I was sent one day, as I was a close contact of a person who had tested positive for COVID-19 and I did self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>



<p>Note that the query string of these URLs contains three fields; <code>p</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>language</code>.</p>

<p>It’s clear that <code>language</code> refers to the language that the requested page should be presented in. This can easily be tested by substituting <code>es</code> for <code>en</code> and noting that the page is now presented in Spanish. Further testing revealed that the self-reporting web app is only available in English and Spanish.</p>

<p>After receiving one of these URLs via SMS every day, it was apparent that the value of the <code>p</code> field didn’t change, while the value of the <code>d</code> field did change each day. That suggested that the <code>p</code> field is the “patient id”, while the <code>d</code> field is the date for which the user is self-reporting their temperatures and symptoms.</p>

<p>Noting that ‘%3D%3D’ is the string ‘==’ being URL encoded, suggests that the value of the <code>d</code> field is simply the date in the format ‘MM/DD/YYY’ base64 encoded (because base64 encoded strings can be padded with ‘=’ or ‘==’ at the end). A simple test of this showed that when I base64 encoded the string ‘07/18/2020’, then URL encoded the result, and then supplied that value as the value of the <code>d</code> field, I could submit information for myself for any future date that was before the last day of my 14 day quarantine.</p>

<p>In my particular case, that meant that simply by changing the URL, I could submit temperature meausurements and other symptoms for myself for any date between 2020-07-07 and 2020-07-21. If I attempted to load the page for 2020-07-22, I was shown a message that I no longer need to complete the survey.</p>

<p>This ability to submit information for a day other than the current day probably isn’t strictly a security bug, but it is somewhat poorly designed and the server-side code clearly doesn’t do any validation on the reporting date since I was able to submit made up results for myself for 2020-07-18.</p>

<p>The more serious issue is the <code>p</code> field, which likely corresponds to a “patient id” or something of that ilk. Because the <code>d</code> field was base64 encoded, it would make sense that the <code>p</code> field is also something that has been base64 encoded. Note that the value of the <code>p</code> field does not have ‘%3D%3D’ at the end. This is because base64 encoded only <em>may</em> be padded with ‘=’ or ‘==’ at the end, but a string doesn’t strictly <em>need</em> to end with those characters. So, by taking the value of the <code>p</code> field and attempting to decode it as base64 yields (in my case) the string “ODH-29825”. This seems like it is in fact some kind of unique identifier for myself in ODH’s database.</p>



<p>Now that we understand what these fields are all used for, it is trivial to create query string parameters in reverse. For example one could attempt to use today’s date (07/27/2020) and the patient id of “ODH-00000” to craft a URL like:</p>
<div><pre>https://octs.odh.ohio.gov/symptom-tracker?p=T0RILTAwMDAw&amp;d=MDcvMjcvMjAyMA==&amp;language=en</pre></div>
<p>and attempt to load the page for that patient. This page will only load if you’ve both selected a valid ODH patient id, and that the date that you’ve used for the value of the <code>d</code> parameter is within the 14 day quarantine period for that ODH patient.</p>

<p>Originally, the patient’s first and last name were displayed on this page. This means that one can simply enumerate patient IDs from ODH-00000 to ODH-9999999 (or some large upper bound), and when an actual person’s name appears on the site, you then know that the person listed has been a close contact of a known positive COVID-19 case and is currently self-quarantining and monitoring. Once a person has been found, you must simply try up to the next 14 days as the value of the <code>d</code> field to determine when they were in contact with a positive COVID-19 case.</p>



<h3 id="2020-07-07">2020-07-07</h3>

<p>I begin receiving these text messages from ODH.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16">2020-07-16</h3>

<p>I resolve to report this to the State of Ohio, as I feel it is a big enough issue to warrant doing so.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1530">2020-07-16 @ 1530</h3>

<p>After searching around on <a href="https://ohio.gov/">https://ohio.gov</a>, I came across <a href="https://infosec.ohio.gov/Incidents/Reportanincident/StateGovernmentSites.aspx">https://infosec.ohio.gov/Incidents/Reportanincident/StateGovernmentSites.aspx</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1540">2020-07-16 @ 1540</h3>

<p>I called the listed number (614-644-8660) and was asked to email the details of what I was reporting to csc@ohio.gov. I was also asked if I was a public employee, to which I responded that while I’m not an employee of the State of Ohio, I am an elected legislator in my village.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1549">2020-07-16 @ 1549</h3>

<p>I sent in an email indicating that I had been asked to email this address and asked how they would like me to securely get the details of the vulnerability to their team.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1551">2020-07-16 @ 1551</h3>

<p>I received automated emails that an incident had been created and had been assigned to someone.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1658">2020-07-16 @ 1658</h3>

<p>I received an email at the email address corresponding to my position as an elected legislator, asking to confirm that this email belongs to the same individual who sent the email to the state at 1540.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-1702">2020-07-16 @ 1702</h3>

<p>I responded in the affirmative to the above email.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-16-2114">2020-07-16 @ 2114</h3>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/zachwick/status/1283933170585554944">tweet the SHA256 sum</a> of <a href="https://github.com/zachwick/ODH_Contact_Tracing/blob/master/proof.txt">this file</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-17-1559">2020-07-17 @ 1559</h3>

<p>I received an email and then shortly after a phone call from a representative from the state and I provided the responding team a password-protected ZIP archive as an email attachment and provided the password to them over the phone. This was the alternative I proposed since the team didn’t seem interested in providing a GPG/PGP key that I could use to encrypt my message to them.</p>

<h3 id="2020-07-23-0929">2020-07-23 @ 0929</h3>

<p>I received an automated email that the incident had been resolved. This email contained the following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ODH worked with the vendor to strip the last names from the data. It was determined that the only data that a bad actor could see would be the name of the citizen that is being traced. ODH has excepted the fix of just removing the last name because of the volume of citizens that are being tracked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I understand the tradeoffs that go into building software, but accepting a fix of only no longer displaying the last name of the person seems less than ideal. Anyone who can construct these URLs can still submit made-up information for any person currently under a 14-day quarantine that has elected to self-report their temperatures and symptoms via the ODH’s web app.</p>

<p>A few alternative, and somewhat more robust, fixes come to mind here. One option is to to create a single-use UUID that maps to a patient and date tuple in the ODH system backend, and then provide users with URLs that look like:</p>
<div><pre>https://octs.odh.ohio.gov/symptom-tracker?t=&lt;SOME_UUID_HERE&gt;</pre></div>
<p>These UUIDs should be created new for each patient for each day, and the server-side code that the self-reporting form submits to should ensure that the date for that UUID matches the current date and that the user has not yet submitted information for that day. This would make it much more difficult to enumerate all of the possible UUIDs and extract the names of people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 because a malicious actor would have a much smaller time window in which a constructed URL would be valid. This also adds at least some server-side data validation.</p>

<p>Another option would be to just turn off the ability for citizens to self-report this health information and instead have local health department employees contact each citizen under quarantine via phone each day to record their health information. This would be much more time consuming, and would cost much more, but would have the added benefit of not being susceptible to false data being reported for a citizen by a malicious actor simply constructing a URL.</p>



<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/zachwick/ODH_Contact_Tracing">a repo</a>, which contains a simple python script that demonstrates how to generate the URL for a given ODH patient id and date. It would be unethical to submit false data for a person other than yourself, but I feel it is important to show how trivial it is to construct these URLs.</p>

<p>It’s an unsettling feeling, leaving college, leaving high school or some kind of post high-school service and entering (what they call) the “real world” and realizing that offers of all kinds don’t come sliding through. Job offers, investment opportunities, whatever else. Yet there is this naive belief that is propagated to our youth that everything just sort of sorts itself out after you enter the aforementioned “real world”.  </p>



<p>The “real world” was laid out to me by some high school teachers/counselors like this: you graduate high school, you go to college, you graduate college, you get a job, you save, you have a family, you retire. Boom, done. You hardly have to think or worry at all, it’s all done for you. They espoused this plan because that’s the plan that worked for them. </p>



<p>When I look at the generation of my high school teachers and counselors this is how life seemed to be (according to my tiny brain) for them when they were my age. Everything was prepackaged and pre-bundled for you on a little conveyor belt, all you had to do was pluck the package you wanted and off you went, things would then go relatively smoothly. And as long as you didn’t destroy it completely and make an effort to keep the plan together, things were going to work out.  </p>



<p>Things are different now, a lot different. This isn’t to say things were better then or worse now, or vice versa, it simply is what it is. </p>



<p>It’s almost like in previous generations the ordinary person didn’t *need* to have a lot of options. Don’t get me wrong, they had most of the same options we do today, they are just … less reliable now. The paths taken then seemed to be more of a success compared to those same paths when taken by my generation. When I refer to “paths” I mostly mean credentialization, but specifically university credentialization. It seems that a few decades ago as long as the proper hoops were jumped through you would be alright. The hoop jumping trick is starting to wear out, and doesn’t have that same appeal to younger people. Not only is the appeal not there, those old paths just don’t work for the masses like they used to.  </p>



<p>I am growing more and more certain that these traditional options are running out of steam. They had their time, they worked, and that’s fine. So what about us zoomers/millennials? What options do we have? </p>



<p>Well, for starters, I think my options are going to be closer to fishing in the wild on my 3rd foodless night than they are to selecting meals off a fast food menu. Our food will have to be caught ourselves and our career options are going to have to be crafted in the same way. </p>



<p> Why do you have to make your own? Mostly because credentialization doesn’t represent real knowledge like we thought it did for a long time. It’s mostly a signal, and it turns out when you build a family/business/economy on people who signalled they have knowledge it’s not as sustainable as it otherwise might be when those people have legitimate knowledge and experience. The college degree means diddly compared to what it meant 50 years ago. When my high school counselors got out of college they went right into the jobs they’d have for the rest of their careers (retirement plans included), and essentially coasted until that retirement came.  I know I am not the only one who got out of college and expected all kinds of those same kind of opportunities to flow in, because that’s what was sold to me in high school! This promise school teachers and advisors make you that once you get there to the “real world” things will be similar to how they always have been. BIG NOPE. Not anymore. That was probably naive of me to take their word for it but hey, here we are. </p>



<p>Ironically, after being taught dependence on the system for so long, the second I got out of that system and into the “real world” the first thing it taught me was 1) Holy crap, they were all wrong, and 2)  no one is going to save me, no employer, no politician, nothing. And even if you are “saved” today with some kind of career opportunity or political handout it’s hardly ever on your terms. And if someone comes to save you it’s probably going to look like this: </p>



<figure><img src="https://i.redd.it/dcf82fk9tz431.jpg" alt="Why even go to school anymore : recruitinghell" width="385" height="483"></figure>







<p>Giving yourself your own options and crafting options for yourself is the best way to make those be to your liking – there will always be product-market fit when it’s done this way.  In my experience with opportunities/jobs that weren’t on my terms they were worth doing only because I realized that it wasn’t sustainable for me and it wasn’t what I wanted to be doing in the long haul. This sort of experience bogs the psyche down. </p>



<p>There is no modern credentialization I can think of that will help you on your way to self sustainability and optionality. The only way to become self-sustainable is to tinker and make decisions based on new information that comes to you. None of this was taught to me while I was in the credential process, I was basically taught dependence on superiors and blind trust to the system, and not much else. There are roles in which credentialing plays an extremely vital part of your path, I am not talking about that. I am referring to the kids who are ostensibly great at nothing and decent at a few things who happen to have no idea what they want to study so they just go to college for a bachelors in business management and end up hating the trajectory that put them on. These kids – much like myself – relate more to Chris Farley or a Johnny Cash. Those who aren’t getting PHD’s anytime soon. </p>



<p>As someone who experienced “Educational Iatrogenics” – by trying to educate me, I was placed on the completely wrong path by nimwit credentializers – and because of that there is damage that needs to be undone, knowledge that needs to be unwound.</p>



<p>But in this case it may be better not to depend on those around you, it may be better for you to take things into your own hands and craft those options yourself, because no one is going to give them to you. This is what our youth should be taught at a younger age – in a less harsh and a more hopeful tone than mine obviously.</p>



<p>I think those who find themselves in a situation much like this are starting to ask themselves this question; Is “thriving” on someone else’s terms as good as surviving (with a non-zero chance of thriving) on your own terms? </p>

The idea of "getting it right" can be incredibly stressful if you're just starting out and things are going wrong left, right and centre.

<p>Docker desktop and minikube are popular options for local development.  Do you need both installed for local development or can you save some RAM and run a only one  of them.  Below are some questions to help you decide which one to use in your situation.</p>



<p><strong>Which version of Kubernetes are you running in production? </strong></p>



<p>Kuberenets (k8s) is on a three month release cycle with an N-2 support policy. For example in July 2020 k8s 1.18 is the most recent GA release, 1.17 and 1.16 are currently supported. When k8s 1.19 is released 1.16 will fall out of support. Many organizations run the oldest supported k8s to minimize risk to production systems.</p>

<p>Docker Desktop includes a hard coded version of Kubernetes. For example at time of writing the most recent Docker desktop includes k8s 1.16.5 since that is the oldest supported version of k8s. </p>

<p>Currently it is not possible to change the version of k8s in Docker desktop. If you need an older version of k8s you will have to install an older version of Docker desktop.  Basically Docker is shipping  the  “most stable, widely used” version of k8s since many organizations run the oldest GA version of k8s in production.  </p>



<p> Minikube supports the most recent GA version of k8s plus the previous 6 minor versions.   You can pass minikube a command line argument to  launch a specific version of k8s. For example, <code>minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.18.3 </code>will launch k8s 1.18.3</p>



<p><strong>How do you build your container images?</strong></p>



<p>If you use a <code>Dockerfile</code> during development you will need to have Docker desktop installed, otherwise you won’t be able to run <code>docker build</code> to create a container image on your laptop. </p>



<p>If you are building your container image using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">JIB</a> that don’t require a local Docker daemon you can run minikube without Docker desktop.</p>



<p><strong>Do you need a local container registry?</strong></p>



<p>Minikube does not ship with a container registry. By default it will try to resolve container images from Docker hub and other public registries. If you need to build containers on your laptop and you want minikube to pull them form your laptop rather than a remote container registry you will benefit from running Docker desktop since it includes a local container registry. </p>



<p><strong>How do you manage local development dependencies? </strong></p>



<p>If your application depends on commonly used OSS databases, message queues, caches you will have to decide how setup these dependencies on your laptop. There are three reasonable choices. </p>



<ul><li>Install on laptop </li><li>Run with docker-compose</li><li>Run on minikube </li></ul>



<p>Installing directly on a laptop can be time consuming and error prone. If you work on multiple apps or services that need different versions of PostgreSQL or MySQL then development becomes more time consuming and error prone.</p>



<p>You can run dependencies using docker-compose  which has a nice developer friendly workflow. </p>



<ul><li>checkout code </li><li><code>docker-compose up</code></li><li>write code / run tests on laptop that use services running in Docker</li><li><code>docker-compose down</code></li></ul>



<p>With docker-compose we are running third party dependencies in simple repeatable manner. </p>



<p>Minikube can also be used to run third party dependencies such as MySQL and other tools. To do so you will have to write k8s deployment manifests and expose the services using a NodePort on the minikube vm ip address. </p>



<p>If you want to use docker-compose for dependencies then you will need docker desktop, otherwise you can get away with minikube. </p>



<p><strong>Are you using JUNIT with test containers ?</strong></p>



<p>If you are using the <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">test containers</a> project for your automated testing you will need to  run Docker Desktop since test containers does not currently support Kubernetes. </p>



<p><strong>Which Operating System are you using for local development?</strong></p>



<p>Docker Desktop is available on MacOS and Windows  and it includes both k8s and docker . On Linux the docker distribution only includes docker, so you will have to  install  k8s from another source.</p>



<p>Minikube is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  If  you are looking for the same developer experience across Mac, Windows, and Linux then minikube is a good choice. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Use docker desktop if  </p>



<ul><li>You need to build  container images from <code>Dockerfile</code></li><li>You need a local container registry</li><li>You are managing your local development environment with docker compose</li><li>You are using test containers with junit</li><li>The version of Kubernetes included in docker desktop is the version  you want to use</li><li>Your developers are only on MacOS and Windows.</li></ul>



<p>Use minikube if</p>



<ul><li>You need to pick a specific version of Kubernetes to work with </li><li>You don’t need a local container registry</li><li>You are not using test containers with junit</li><li>You have developers using Linux, MacOS, and Windows</li></ul>



<p>Based on your answers to the question above it is quite possible that you will need to run both. </p>

<p><em>Be kind to your future self. If</em><em> you feel stuck, the best thing you can possibly do for future “you” is to make time to reinvent present “you.”</em></p>



<p>Six months ago, I was totally out of answers.</p>



<p>It was a chilly, dreary January day in Denver, Colorado. I had just left my job at a marketing company back home in Philadelphia, and I had no idea what I was going to do next. My only instinct, the day I left the office for good, was to book a flight for a short getaway to the Mile-High City, one of my favorite places to visit. I needed that space. I needed that clarity of mind. I was sick and tired of striking out in my search for meaningful work, and I didn’t know where else to look. </p>



<p>Just three years prior, I made the decision to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">leave another unfulfilling office job to carve my own path</a>. At the time, I knew it was a huge risk, but it was something I knew I needed to do to have any chance of realizing my full potential. But on this cold and lonely day in Denver, it felt like Groundhog Day all over again. Walking down a quiet street in the city’s North Capitol Hill section, I saw my reflection in a café window. I saw no change.</p>



<p>In three years, I went from depressed office worker to world-traveler, to excited entrepreneur, to the pinnacle of the restaurant industry, and back to depressed office worker. Had I just spent those years chasing my tail? What had I accomplished besides coming full circle to yet another desk job?</p>



<p>If this was my master plan to reinvent myself and carve my own path, I was failing miserably. The problem was that I was relying too much on other people for opportunities to determine my future. The bigger problem was that I never gave myself the time to do it for myself.</p>







<h3><strong>The Missing Link</strong></h3>



<p>Running a restaurant for two of those three years since escaping the cubicle had left me with little time to even think, let alone sleep and shower. My family suffered for it. My girlfriend suffered for it. And my potential for the personal growth and freedom I so yearned for suffered for it.</p>



<p>While walking along the Pearl Street Mall in Denver, I did a quick mental calculation. There are only 24 hours in a day. No matter if you are just scraping by, or if you are Bill Gates, we all have the same amount of this most valuable asset—<em>time</em>. You spend a third of that time sleeping. When you account for the time spent eating, showering, driving, working, etc., you are left with a measly 2-3 hours. And that’s at best. With those remaining hours, you just want to spend it relaxing on the couch, unwinding from the day. When do you find time to reinvent yourself? How can you meaningfully change course from an unfulfilling path that is sucking up all of your time?</p>



<p>Sure, if you want to grind straight through each day, you are free to do that. While there are some mutants out there who have been successful using this method, it does not work for most of us. You simply cannot rely on willpower alone to build anything of quality and value in the long run. You have to get smart and build a reliable system that creates time and cultivates curiosity. On that day in Denver, I decided I needed to find more time to reinvent myself.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Find More Time</strong></h3>



<p>Coincidentally, Covid-19 took the world by storm shortly after I returned to Philadelphia. Was it a sign from the heavens that I was waiting for? Was it just a coincidence that I needed to recognize and take full advantage of? Whatever it was, it virtually cleared out months of time for me to reinvent myself. So I moved up to a cabin in the Pocono Mountains and got to work.</p>



<p>Even with the pandemic keeping many of us home, finding time still is a big problem. Working from home, handling kids, making dinner, handling the endless chores around the house, and making time to get outside to avoid cabin fever are among the responsibilities for those of us lucky enough to be working from home. Whether you are working from home, working on site, or simply looking for a better system for reinventing your life, I have a four-step, actionable process that will ensure your ability to pivot from an unfulfilling path.</p>



<h4><strong>Step One: Commit</strong></h4>



<p><em>“The difference between involvement and commitment is like ham and eggs. The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>– Martina Navratilova</p>



<p>The most important step of this entire equation is to commit to yourself. You must commit to making the change you so deeply desire. If not, then the rest of this process falls apart.</p>



<p>Just looking at yourself in the mirror and hoping for a change won’t do it. Looking at the Kardashians and wanting their life won’t do it. Chasing the highest paying job you can find won’t do it. Extrinsic motivation never works in the long run if you want to make meaningful change in your life.</p>



<p>You must have an intrinsic, in-your-blood, raging-fire type motivation. Everyone has it. Everyone has that “something” that gets them out of bed in the morning. It just depends on how much the fire has been dulled by years of unsatisfying work and sub-optimal habits.</p>



<p>For me, my intrinsic motivation is family. To reinvent myself is something I needed to do for my family (and a family of my own in the future). I never want to look at my reflection in another café window to see the same underachieving person. I needed to be better for myself and for my family. That is my driving force.</p>



<p>You could also use the <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/11/12-favorite-problems/">12 Favorite Problems</a> approach. There is no best approach to finding your purpose, but when I am out of answers, this method cuts straight through to the source.</p>



<p>Find that force in your own life—your “<em>why</em>.” Commit to reinvent yourself on a foundation of intrinsic motivation. Make it urgent, because you never know when your time on earth will be up. This is not a process for improving your life. This is a way of actively saving it.</p>



<h4><strong>Step Two: Simplify</strong></h4>



<p>Once you make this commitment to saving your life, you must take steps from the outset to clear a path. </p>



<p>Most of us, and I am surely in this group, can be hindered by clutter. Physical clutter, mental clutter, digital clutter, time clutter. All of this, whether conscious or not, serves to slow us down and overwhelm us.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Physical Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>I started by <strong>cleaning my work area</strong>. Getting rid of unnecessary papers, trash, and even objects that didn’t contribute to the look and feel of my work environment. Keeping only the necessary items in the physical spaces where I spend most of my time has made a world of difference. As I always say:</p>



<p><em>External Mess = Internal Stress</em></p>



<p>Don’t underestimate the power of your physical environment. Build a place that you are comfortable in, that motivates you, that facilitates calmness and thoughtfulness, that inspires you to do your best meaningful work. You will instantly become more efficient with your time.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Mental Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>This is possibly the toughest area to declutter. The mind is so complex, so unpredictable, and so ever-present that it is hard to even know where to start. </p>



<p>Pick one area that brings you the most stress. I started with quitting the news.</p>



<ul><li>By <strong>not watching the news</strong>, I have seen a drastic improvement in my metal state. It is a classic example of addition by subtraction. If a piece of news is important enough, it will find its way to me. But I’ll pass on being depressed by the never-ending stream of crime and politics.</li><li>Along the same lines, <strong>read less junk</strong>. Scrolling Buzzfeed and your Facebook timeline endlessly will do nothing but make you jealous and lethargic. Clear that head-space, and clear that time off your calendar for more useful activities that will get you on the path to achieving your goal.</li><li><strong>Meditate</strong>, or just simply give your mind some time to breathe. Constantly crowding it with unnecessary and stressful inputs will drain your ability and your inspiration for self-reinvention.</li></ul>



<h5><strong><em>Digital Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<ul><li><strong>Clean out your inbox</strong>. Better yet, schedule a time each week for “inbox-zero.” For me, that is every Sunday night. Being able to accomplish that goal before the new week is often the springboard I need to get off to an productive start.</li><li><strong>Clear your desktop on your computer</strong>. Create folders, label properly, and commit to maintaining your filing system. Clutter on your screen will lead to more feelings of overwhelm and ineffectiveness.</li><li><strong>Cut down on TV</strong>. You may be in the habit of watching Netflix with your loved ones when you have some free time. But turning off the TV and doing more interactive things with your family and friends can give you a boost in creativity and productivity that you wouldn’t normally get from passive screen time. Less TV is bound to free up a couple more hours per week.</li></ul>



<p>There are so many more ways to declutter your digital life. These are the three that have helped me the most.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Time Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>In our daily lives, we tend not to organize our time in the way we organize tangible areas like our desks, our homes, and our computers. Due to the invisibility of time, we often let our days become cluttered with insidious, time-sucking activities that will inevitably crowd out productive time each day. To fend off this type of clutter:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Block out time on your calendar for productive work</strong>. By scheduling your week ahead of time, you can visually account for where your time will go. I simply use the calendar on Microsoft Outlook. Many people use Notion or write it down by hand. It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you make an effort to document it.</li><li><strong>Cut down on meetings</strong>. If someone needs to meet in person, see if a phone call will do. If they want to talk on the phone, see if an email will do. If they want to reach out over email, see if a text message will do. Be ruthless, yet respectful.</li><li><strong>Simplify …</strong></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div>
						<p>Online communities often grow from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grouped-groups-friends-influence-social/dp/0321804112?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">small, enthusiastic, intelligent niche group</a> that is relatively self-policing to a larger, amorphous group that becomes stupider at a rate that’s an exponent of the number of users (the linked book is excellent on this topic). Initial moderators are usually enthusiasts and small groups are more like communities than cities. Later moderators, though, are usually adversely selected: What kind of person would voluntarily spend lots of time and energy policing a community for no money? Consequently, online community decline is often exacerbated by the moderator or moderators who eventually take over or seek power.</p>
<p>The psychology of someone who is willing to moderate a Reddit subsection—or any similar site, like many mailing lists—is not good. This sort of person is willing to spend a time at a thankless task that is hard to do well and rarely if ever remunerative.</p>
<p>Those who start at that task do so optimistically but often quit as their lives change or the task becomes more onerous. Who gets left? People with axes to grind; people with no sense of perspective; petty tyrants; and so on. I don’t use Reddit much for many reasons, but low moderator quality is one. I rarely bother messaging them because doing so is largely a waste of time.</p>
<p>The problem with moderators is not dissimilar from the problem of users: People who regularly have something interesting to say and the means to say it well get blogs, as I wrote in “<a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2013/06/05/social-news-sites-and-forums-should-encourage-users-to-blog/">Social news sites and forums should encourage users to blog</a>.” Those who don’t stay on Reddit. The average Reddit contributor has little stake in long-term reputation—unlike bloggers, journalists, and academics who use real names—and that shows in the quality and quantity of posts. That may not hurt the site—the popularity of bad TV shows over many years demonstrates lowest-common denominator issues—but it should hurt in terms of high-quality users.</p>
<p>A form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s Law</a> applies to social sites and to moderators: bad commentary pushes out the good, and smart people flee stupid comments. One could alternately call this a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Tragedy_of_the_commons.html">tragedy of the commons</a>, in which communal spaces become overrun with spam or commentary so stupid that it might as well be spam.</p>
<p>Reddit and similar sites can have an orthogonal problem, however, as they become so afraid of self-interested commentary or posts that they forbid it—thus causing smart people to go elsewhere with their thoughts, and leaving the dregs unwilling or able to create standalone communities or blogs.</p>
<p>This may be part of the reason why Reddit—even on the “good” subsections—tend to be better for beginners: anyone who gets past the beginning stages needs more expert advice than Redditors can provide. The same is happening to Hacker News, too, or it has already happened, though not as severely: Hacker News has an advantage in that its survival and the intelligent commentary on it is tied to a business that is in turn tied to ideas. Its moderators have a stronger incentive to get it right, since they’re not driven primarily by ego or overwhelming fear of “spam.”</p>
<p>That being said, anyone who has seen an unmoderated forum is aware of the fact that unmoderated forums are unusable. So getting rid of moderators is not a solution. In general the mechanisms of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604;ref">exit, voice, and loyalty</a>, as described by Hirshman at the link, apply on the level of online communities. But constantly shifting for newer communities where smart people congregate is at best difficult and at worst a waste of time in and of itself. Reddit has to some extent worked on this problem through the sub-Reddit system, which is a better-than-nothing solution but not a great one.</p>
<p>Maybe there is no good solution to this from the perspective of smart users other than withdrawal. Better blogs written by smart individuals or groups are better than virtually any online, Reddit-like community I’ve found. Which is too bad. But I doubt most people in latter-day moderator positions are even willing or able to read this post, and, if they are, I don’t think they’ll understand it, and, if they do, I don’t think they’ll accept any of it.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>SaaS businesses (particularly ones for technical users) sometimes have to deal with a vocal outcry that their product “is just a wrapper around” something. The implication is that ‘a wrapper’ is inherently not valuable, and it’s impossible to build a great business around such a product. This logic is a product of lazy thinking and myopia; <strong>‘wrappers’ can be insanely valuable.</strong><!-- more --></p>

<p>Here are a few examples that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dropbox is “just rsync”</li>
  <li>Heroku is “just Linux containers on AWS”</li>
  <li>Netlify is “just static hosting and a CDN”</li>
  <li>Retool is “just MS Access reinvented for the web”</li>
  <li>IFTTT is “just cron + APIs”</li>
</ul>

<p>These statements are lazy thinking–they have elements of truth in them, but they aren’t complete. <strong>People are willing to pay for magic</strong>. This magic sometimes goes by names like “it just works” or “consumerized experience.” The thread that runs through the different monikers is that it accomplishes an otherwise painful<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> task quickly and delights the user.</p>

<p>Technical users want to be delighted, too, even if the interaction layer may not be a GUI. It might be a CLI, fantastic docs, or a clean API (or likely all of the above). So, if you can take something painful and move the interaction layer, the value proposition of the underlying tools grows.</p>

<p>Big cloud providers will likely offer a comparable service, <a href="https://www.tclauson.com/2019/09/11/Unbundling-AWS.html">but these aren’t often existential threats to the best-in-class original</a>. Why? <strong>Because the interaction layer matters</strong> and a meaningful subset of users are willing to pay for the premium experience.</p>

<p>A few condensed observations about this ‘interaction layer’:</p>
<ul>
  <li>people want a ‘sensible defaults’ way of doing things … an opinionated way of starting out</li>
  <li>UI/UX matters a lot (this includes docs and CLI)</li>
  <li>rarely, the core value prop isn’t already being accomplished crudely by huge companies</li>
  <li>modern open-source companies that are successful have to nail this in ways their predecessors didn’t<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>consumerization of everything — i.e., how little of $PLUMBING can I get away with knowing?</li>
  <li>there are a meaningful number of technical users who can do something, but don’t want to waste otherwise valuable time doing so</li>
</ul>

<p>One could argue that the term for this is just ‘user experience,’ but that doesn’t seem quite right to me. Because it’s not about an experience of the underlying tool or process, it’s about creating an entirely new tool by ‘wrapping’ some of the original components.</p>

<article>
    <p>TL;DR
<a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown with Confluence</a></p>

<p>Oh man, I was so frustrated when I was trying to edit docs in Confluence, and it
broke all my text, trying to adjust any tags led to breaking the text even more.
I felt the same when Slack introduced their Wysiwyg editor that solved problems that never existed,
but at least they added an option to disable it.</p>
<p>Wysiwyg is the Devil’s Playground, but there is a solution.</p>
<p>Store with Git, write in Markdown, automatically sync with Confluence. Interesting? Let me tell you
about seven benefits that you could have if you could use Git for storing your docs instead of editing
them directly in Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Git</strong><br>
Confluence has a history of changes, but it’s very limited: you can’t do <code>git blame</code>,
you can’t do <code>git log -S</code> to search who added a specific text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull Requests</strong><br>
Now, someone with a fresh set of eyes can identify problems and provide suggestions for docs.
You write code — someone reviews it, you write a book — someone reviews it.
Now, you write docs — someone reviews it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instruments</strong><br>
We have some great tools like VSCode, Neovim, Sublime, or Idea with all required set of
extensions that make our coding even more efficient and less frustrating.</p>
<p>Then why not using it for writing docs? It’s more efficient than Wysiwyg for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No context switching</strong><br>
No need to jump around to read docs a bit. Just open it up in your editor
because you store the docs near to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hosting Agnostic</strong><br>
You can just push your docs on GitHub if you want to open source it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decentralization</strong><br>
Everyone has their own complete copy of docs, develops it, and syncs up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong><br>
If you have a proper tool that I’m going to introduce, you can automatically update your docs in
Confluence after a successful <code>git push</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown documentation with Atlassian Confluence</a></p>
<p>Mark reads your Markdown file, creates a Confluence page if it doesn’t, uploads
attachments if any, translates Markdown into HTML, and updates the contents of the page via REST API.</p>
<p>It’s like you don’t even need to create sections/pages in your Confluence anymore, just mention them in
your .md files.</p>
<p>Mark uses an extended file format, which, still being valid markdown, contains several HTML-ish
metadata headers, which can be used to locate page inside Confluence instance and update it
accordingly.</p>

following path:<br>
<code>Dev / Automation / Documentation → Sync Markdown to Confluence</code>, then render
Markdown as HTML and put the contents via REST API on the user’s behalf.</p>

<p>It’s quite trivial to integrate Mark into a CI/CD system, here is an example with <a href="https://snake-ci.com/">Snake CI</a>
in case of self-hosted Bitbucket Server / Data Center.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>stages</span><span>:</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, I’m using the <code>kovetskiy/mark</code> image for creating a job container where the
repository with documentation will be cloned to. The following command finds all <code>*.md</code> files and runs mark against them one by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>for</span> file in <span>$(</span>find -type f -name <span>'*.md'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; Sync </span><span>$file</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    mark -u <span>$MARK_USER</span> -p <span>$MARK_PASS</span> -b <span>$MARK_URL</span> -f <span>$file</span> <span>||</span> <span>exit</span> 1<span>;</span>
    echo<span>;</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The following directive tells the CI to run this particular job only if the changes are pushed into the
<code>main</code> branch. It means you can safely push your changes into feature branches without being afraid
that they automatically shown in Confluence, then go through the reviewal process and automatically
deploy them when PR got merged.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>I recently TA’d a workshop Intro To Functional Programming With Elixir given by a co-worker. Not only did I want to help them out, I also wanted to support someone teaching as they learn, and learn something myself. </p><p>Over the past 6 months I’ve begun learning backend (via Elixir) in the way I’ve learned pretty much everything I know as a developer, by doing. Having a practical learning background means that I’ve started out in complex environments that offer a lot by way of example in real, production code — but it also means that there can be a lot of unknowns that remain along the way. The specific black box addressed in the workshop: the difference between functional and object oriented programming. </p><p>In most intros to Elixir this gets touched on at least in part, it being a functional language is one of the main attractions, but as a developer without a traditional CS background, I missed the lesson on what object oriented programming means, so knowing and leveraging the differences was beyond me. Something I really admire about my co-worker and all teach-as-they-learn instructors is the act of stepping up before feeling you’re on solid ground. It’s easy for me to eschew an instructor role for the usual reasons, telling myself “there are so many people out there who know more than me,” and “not knowing the material perfectly means I shouldn’t be explaining it to any one else.” In so many ways these mantras continue to feel true for me, but there is one caveat: they are less true in the programming world. The reality is, as programmers, we are all learning, all at the same time. If someone sits down to pair with you, they are coming to the problem the same as you. They might bring along a larger reference catalog with them, but they are still looking at, understanding and working at a problem just like you are.</p><p>In this workshop, my co-worker had a bunch of TAs in the (video conference) room, many very experienced engineers. As my co-worker went along through the talk, they allowed space for others to jump in if anything had been muddled or could use extra explaining. The majority of the time, they listened quietly along with everyone else. This was a brilliant, if somewhat intimidating setup. Shoot your shot and if there are any hiccups, there are other people around to catch them and fill in the blanks.</p><p>During the course of the lecture and in the subsequent breakout lab I found myself right in the middle of the road. I had a lot of questions, a lot of things I still didn’t understand, but I also was eager to help others who were earlier along in understanding concepts I had a better grasp on. Even things I did know, I was able to confirm them or learn new aspects to them or new applications. Even some simple things I hadn’t noticed before like syntactic indicators of functional programming made their way into my head and into an Elixir module talk I was soon to give for the second time. </p><p>I love practical explanations and drawing comparisons between concepts. I’m sure this is because of my learning experiences coming into development as I have. I’m still working on coming out of my shell on things I don’t know and filling in the education gaps as I work full time and jump into programming worlds that are new to me. One thing I’m beginning to understand more is how much avoiding teach-as-you-learn can be a real lose/lose. By the time you have a better command of a subject, you’re not as involved in the learning process around it. That means not only am I passing up an opportunity to learn and to do so in a more comfortable environment among peers where making mistakes and asking “dumb” questions feels less scary, I’m also less likely to pass on what I know and help someone else out. All this to say that I was inspired by my co-worker and the experience allowed me to rethink how I approach learning and how I could be more gratifyingly involved in teaching and improving with others.</p><p><em>Header photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nesabymakers?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">NESA by Makers</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em><br></p>

                    <p><strong>AI may replace human in enterprise decision making</strong></p><p>“As AI continues to be more prevalent, it is undeniable that <em>automated decisioning will replace traditional white-collar workers</em>. This means AI systems will be making the decisions instead of humans for anything from approving loans or deciding whether a customer should be on boarded to identifying corruption and financial crime. This is distinct from Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which simply emulates human decisioning. Instead, true AI systems will go beyond human capability. We can also expect to see greater understanding in the boardroom about what AI really means—including hard-nosed figures around competitive advance, reducing costs of operations and removing headcount. Expect to see this C-suite understanding trigger issues around unions and job security as a result of significant operational changes”—Imam Hoque, COO &amp; Head of Product, <a href="https://www.quantexa.com/">Quantexa</a></p><p><strong>AI for business insights discovery</strong></p><p>“AI will add an extra layer of predictability, allowing organizations to see patterns and gain insights from IoT devices and past customer behaviors—ultimately making supply chains smarter, leading to faster, more efficient production and fulfillment, and happier customers. <em>In 2019 and beyond, we can expect AI to take supply chains from reactive in nature to prescriptive levels, helping companies get one step ahead of consumers’ rising expectations</em>”—Hala Zeine, President of Digital Supply Chain, <a href="https://www.sap.com/index.html">SAP</a></p><p><strong>2019 will differentiate between laggards and leaders</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>2019 is the year where we have everything in our hands to use digital technology; it will be the year that will differentiate the laggards and the leaders, providing competitive advantage to the forward-thinking organizations. The laggards still believe there is time, and will keep developing solutions in silos, making small progress, without realizing the pace of change is accelerating faster than in the last 20 years. <em>The leaders are the ones that are set for digital transformation across their organizations, and who will leverage Big Data and AI to deploy solutions that fundamentally affect the full drug development life cycle</em>; they will reverse the current trend—growth of drug development timelines by 25%, reaching a startling 12 years on average—and bring much-needed therapies to the market sooner”—Isabelle deZegher, Vice President, Integrated Solutions,<a href="https://www.parexel.com/"> PAREXEL</a></p><p><strong>A new breed of security data scientists will emerge</strong></p><p><em>“As AI and ML become mainstream, </em>a new breed of security data scientists will emerge in 2019<em>. Preparing, processing, and interpreting data require data scientists to be polymath. They need to know computer science, data science, and above all, need to have domain expertise to be able to tell bad data from good data and bad results from good results. What we have already begun seeing is the need for security experts who understand data science and computer science to be able to first make sense of the security data available to us today. Once this data is prepared, processed and interpreted, it can then be used by AI and ML techniques to automate security in real time”—Setu Kulkarni, Vice President of Corporate Strategy, </em><em><a href="https://www.whitehatsec.com/">WhiteHat Security</a></em></p><p><strong>Shop-for-data marketplace</strong></p><p>“<em>Centralized data will be replaced by a single view of all data</em>. Data is coming at us from different directions, at different speeds, and in different formats, and controlling this tsunami is one of the key markers of empowerment and success in the information age. Two massive trends are changing the landscape. First, different vendors are coming together to standardize data models. Second, and more important, is the emergence of enterprise data catalogs. These catalogs are accessible in a hub, with one view of the entire federated data estate, and deliver a shop-for-data marketplace experience. The more you share, collaborate, and use the hub, the more valuable it becomes to the business. Furthermore, it links your analytics strategy with your enterprise data management strategy, as the data becomes analysis-ready”—Dan Sommer, Senior Director, <a href="https://www.qlik.com/us">Qlik</a></p><p><strong>AI to satisfy the demand of consumers</strong></p><p>“We are still far from having a bonafide ‘smart home’ and the primary roadblock is the lack of the essential link between sensing and action. Currently, we have a variety of technologies that offer a compelling vision of the future, but that vision is impeded by the fact that the devices are isolated, lacking context, and are thus unable to act autonomously: the consumer must still supply the intelligence for the ‘smart home.’ <em>The mating of RF sensing technology with mesh and other networking schemes will amplify the value of network hardware, enabling them to provide powerful communications infrastructure and sensory feedback</em>—the necessary convergence of control and communications needed to create cognitive systems. We will see this convergence entering the market in 2019, led by forward-thinking tech players who will build out this visionary ecosystem to satisfy the demands of consumers who want to see a Jetson—esqe future, now.”—Nebu Mathai, EVP Product Engineering, <a href="https://www.cognitivesystems.com/">Cognitive Systems Corp.</a></p><p><strong>Trust credibly across user communities</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>In 2019, the value statement of every vendor that builds AI systems should focus on BOTH the value they wish to create AND the underlying moral foundation of their service. How they collect data, with whom they share that data, and what they end up doing with that data will increasingly need a litmus test for what is acceptable and not. That litmus test needs to be part of the culture of the vendor—it needs to come from the inside out. While this will feel too ‘touchy-feely’ and constraining to some vendors, it is absolutely necessary for long-term business viability to establish trust credibly across their user communities. <em>Without transparency, there is no trust. Without trust, there is no data. Withoutdata, there is no AI</em>”—Ojas Rege, Chief Strategy Officer, <a href="https://www.mobileiron.com/en">MobileIron</a></p><p><strong>AI is making its impact across industries</strong></p><p>“Multi-trillion-dollar markets such as commercial real estate are comprised of an intricate web of interactions that affect every decision, and AI technology is now mature enough to tackle these highly complex transactions. As industry leaders are opening up to the potential of integrating advanced technology into core operations, <em>AI is making its impact felt across new industries that were previously off limits</em>. We see asset managers looking to develop new investment vehicles defined by AI that will enable enhanced performance in uncertain economic conditions, adding value throughout the entire investment lifecycle”—Guy Zipori, CEO, <a href="http://www.skyline.ai/">Skyline AI </a></p><p><strong>Need of third party data</strong></p><p>“The future of third-party data is critical for marketers to stay actionable and competitive in a fast-moving technology landscape. The culmination of high-profile corporate privacy scandals and new wide-sweeping data legislation has forced consumers to get to grips with their digital footprints and has caused them to be more critical over how they are targeted. <em>Moving forward, third party data will help marketers gather more insights surrounding how consumers use emerging technologies such as voice, location-based search and AI, so they can target them in a way that is compliant and drives ROI</em>. This data will remain key to informing the bulk of marketing strategy for years to come"—Chase Buckle, Senior Trends Analyst, <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.com/">GlobalWebIndex</a></p><p><strong>Impacts of AI on productivity and engagement</strong></p><p>“As automated technologies shape the workplace in 2019, it’s important for companies to think about how the onslaught of technology will impact their company culture in the short and long-term. Many organizations are already using AI to search for talent, but <em>when it comes to other areas of the workplace where employees will be encountering AI on a daily basis, companies need to understand employee perceptions from the start</em>. Before rolling out any new technology platforms, businesses need to be prepared to communicate the value the product will bring to the organization, how it will affect employees for the better, and the positive impact it will have on productivity and engagement. In doing this, companies will set their organizations up for success when implementing new technologies”—Andee Harris, President, <a href="http://highground.com/">HighGround/</a><a href="http://youearnedit.com/">YouEarnedIt</a></p>

Out of all the new things that came along with the release, one feature that stood apart was <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/machine-learning/ml-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapML</a>.</p><p id="2991">SnapML allows lens creators to use their own custom machine learning models inside filters. Snapchat filters already use ML for a variety of things like face tracking, surface tracking, segmentation, facial gestures, and more.</p><p id="fef5">But with SnapML, developers can now go beyond those limits, using the breadth of their imaginations to combine custom ML models with Snapchat’s feature-rich augmented reality tools—and an audience of millions!</p><p id="49e5">Snapchat has made a lot of initial efforts to make the experience of implementing ML models as smooth and straightforward as possible. To do this, they’ve provided several ready-to-use templates that could be turned into AR experiences in only a few minutes. Let’s explore these templates and learn how to use them to create filters.</p><p id="a0a1">There are 5 main Lens Studio templates provided by Snap that cover some of the most common mobile machine learning tasks. We’ll cover the ML side of things a bit later, but first, here’s a look at the template projects inside Lens Studio:</p><h2 id="880d"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Style Transfer</strong></a></h2><p id="a9ab"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Style transfer</a> is used to modify the overall visual appearance of the camera texture. Essentially, this task allows us to recompose the content of one image in the style of another.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="cc30">This could be used to create unique artistic styles or color filters. Imagine a selfie in the style of your favorite visual artists. This is similar to what we see in many image and video editing apps like <a href="https://prisma-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prisma</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looq-photo-video-filters/id1159704664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looq</a>.</p><p id="f688">This project template contains an example ML model with a style transfer visual effect. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom style transfer model.</p><h2 id="4439"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/classification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Classification</strong></a></h2><p id="5517">This template uses the <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image classification</a> ML technique, which is used to classify images into different labels. This task is also sometimes referred to as image labeling or image recognition.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg" width="500" height="250" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1a92">This could be used to tell, for example, whether user is wearing a hat or not in a given image or video frame. However, to create this kind of model, you’ll need to train it on a large dataset. There’s a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=image+classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide variety of image classification datasets out there</a>, but if there’s no dataset available for your use case, you’ll need to collect and label one.</p><p id="0e08">This template contains an example ML model that can tell if the user is wearing glasses or not, showing a particle effect if true. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom image classification model.</p><h2 id="f5e1"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Object Detection</strong></a></h2><p id="6f56">The <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object detection</a> template could be used to identify and locate one or more target objects in a given image or video frame. Object detection is somewhat similar to image classification, but it’s important to quickly distinguish the two:</p><ul><li id="138a">Image classification assigns a label to an image. A picture of a dog receives the label “dog”.

You can also detect their location on the screen and when the feet touch each other.</li><li id="5738"><strong>Multi-Segmentation- </strong>whats’s better than segmentation? Multi-segmentation, this template allows you to segment more than 1 region on the image and add your texture/effect mask on it</li><li id="d06b"><strong>Eyebrow Addition/Removal- </strong>as the name suggests you could remove the user’s eyebrow or add a new silly one using this template</li><li id="aa79"><strong>Face Mask Classification and Segmentation- </strong>this template is super useful in context with the COVID-19 pandemic situation where wearing a face mask has become essential for safety.

As such, they can all be tweaked easily to create a variety of effects—but if you're trying to create something unique and more specific, you’ll need to train your own custom machine learning model.</p><p id="590e">These Notebooks contain model training code and step-by-step instructions to create custom ML models for your own dataset. On running the code in these Notebooks, you will get a .onnx or .pb model file as output after the training is complete. You can then import this model as an ML Component into the Lens Studio project templates we discussed above.</p><blockquote><p id="40ed">To learn more on how ML models work in SnapML check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/exploring-snapml-a-technical-overview-45d37114fe81">this high-level technical overview</a> by <a href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/@moellman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Moellman</a>.</p></blockquote><p id="43b2">Let’s take a look at what you need to provide as an input to each of these ML templates to get the desired model output:</p><ul><li id="e3b5"><strong>Style transfer:</strong> This is one is the simplest to accomplish, because you only need to provide a single style reference image and a test image (one is already provided for you upon download).

You can use publicly available datasets for this purpose, like <a href="http://www.image-net.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ImageNet</a>.</li><li id="c51c"><strong>Object detection: </strong>For object detection, the dataset should contain a large number of images of a particular object and an accompanied annotations file that contains the label and the coordinates of each object’s bounding box.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>I was trying to optimize a bash script and wondered how much echo statements would slow it down, so I did a few tests. I was specifically wondering if adding a check for verbosity before an echo statement would have a significant affect on runtime, vs just removing the echo statement all together.</p>

<p>I used this script to run the benchmark:

<p>I set <code>echo</code> to <code>01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789</code> when benchmarking for long echo statements, and to <code>foo</code> when benchmarking short echo statements.</p>

<p>The different options had significant differences in runtime. Checking for verbosity and not printing took an average of <code>1.5 - 1.7</code> times as long as not printing anything at all! I definitely took this into consideration when deciding which echo statements were really necessary for my bash script.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this benchmark is based on <code>echoing</code> to a file. By echoing to the console the options that print would take significantly longer.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any comments below!</p>

We've pulled out the most dominant colors they use in their user interface. This is a result of their design teams iterating over time learning how to make the ideal experience for their users. A fun thing I love to do is browse through a website in the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to see the iterations to their web design over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>With no further ado, let's dive in.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. youtube.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,625,928,544</em></p><p>First up, we have YouTube. As the classic example of a user generated community, their use of a monochromatic color scheme allows their user content to stand out while the rest of the site's buttons dial back the stylistic features like extra chrome, button lines etc. The color red is used sparingly throughout the site experience to make their brand presence.</p><figure id="w-node-dd30d522abdd-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f0f3f346a77c079f50c_Youtube.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. en.wikipedia.org</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,032,257,682</em></p><p>Next, we have Wikipedia, our collective human hive mind. The most important UI here is the blue link that is the connective UI between all the pages. Our branched experience is guided by the contrast of the black and blue text. The subtle pastel colors are used to identify different types of information on a page.</p><figure id="w-node-f3e9626686b1-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f1c2797441bbf314858_Wikipedia.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. twitter.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 535,672,329</em></p><p>Twitter's web design has changed a lot over the years. The 2020 design has minimalized to a simple color scheme that consists of a dominant blue used for main call to actions, and a beautiful set of bluish grays to create a hierarchy of text styles.</p><figure id="w-node-57f2c70343ff-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f26091a846f51452e16_Twitter.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. facebook.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 512,517,207</em></p><p>Compared to Twitter, Facebook's color scheme is a bit more complex. It involves many more notifications and vibrant colors taking you from one corner of the UI to the next. It's surprising that Facebook hasn't mimicked more of Youtube's philosophy especially since they too rely on a lot of photography and user generated content.</p><figure id="w-node-d68aa9f10aad-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f313f346a777379f62c_Facebook.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>5. amazon.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 492,468,801</em></p><p>Amazon's web design is heavily anchored by the dark navigation bar with the search box. Since their shopping experience relies on intent to buy, reminding shoppers where to search and how accessible it is is very important for them. Light blues and yellows are used to accent the large boxes of white and bring attention to prime branding and other special deals.</p><figure id="w-node-f1131ed9d6fa-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f3f2a3bf07561ef0472_Amazon.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>6. yelp.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 189,284,057</em></p><p>Yelp's design is similar to Youtube.

Since the value of Reddit is that anyone can customize a subreddit to their audience's liking, there is no universal color scheme for Reddit.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			




<p>Scrypt is a slow-by-design <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a> or more accurately, a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">KDF</a> function. Its purpose is to take some input data, and create a fingerprint of that data, but to do it very slowly. A common use-case is to take a password and create an n-bit private key, which is much longer and more secure. Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">Qvault</a> we use a similar KDF for securing user passwords.</p>



<p>For example, let’s pretend your password is password1234. By using Scrypt, we can extend that deterministically into a 256-bit key:</p>



<p><strong>password1234 </strong>-&gt; <br>AwEEDA4HCwQFAA8DAwwHDQwPDwUOBwoOCQACAgUJBQ0JAAYNBAMCDQ4JCQgLDwcGDQMDDgMKAQsNBAkLAwsACA==</p>



<p>That long 256-bit key can now be used as a private key to encrypt and decrypt data. For example, it could be the key in an <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> cipher.</p>



<h2><span id="Why_not_use_the_password_to_encrypt_directly">Why not use the password to encrypt directly?</span>
</h2>



<p>Most encryption algorithms, including AES-256, require that a key of sufficient length is used. By hashing the password, we can derive a longer, more secure, fixed-size key.</p>



<p>Furthermore, using a KDF like Scrypt provides additional benefits over a traditional hash function like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Computationally expensive and slow</li>
<li>Memory intensive (potentially several gigabytes of RAM is used to execute the hash)</li>
</ul>
<p>Often times <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/02/11/how-do-brute-force-attackers-know-they-found-the-key/">brute-force attackers</a> will try to break encryption by guessing passwords over and over until they get it right. <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> and SHA-2 are fast, so an attacker would be able to guess many passwords per second. By using a slow hashing function like Scrypt to derive a key, we can force the attacker to waste more resources trying to break in.</p>



<h2><span id="Scrypt_Step-by-Step">Scrypt Step-by-Step</span>
</h2>



<p>Scrypt can be visualized by some psuedo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	// we'll get to theis
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s go through the steps of converting those inputs into the desired <code>derivedKey</code></p>



<h3><span id="1_-_Define_Blocksize">1 – Define Blocksize</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor</code></pre>



<h3><span id="2_-_Generate_Initial_Salt">2 – Generate Initial Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Scrypt uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> as a child key-derivation function. We use it to generate an initial salt. PBKDF2 has the following signature:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func PBKDF2(
	prf,
	password,
	salt,
	numIterations,
	desiredKeyLen
) derivedKey {}</code></pre>



<p>We use it as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="3_-_Mix_Salt">3 – Mix Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Next, we mix the salt. We split <code>initialSalt</code> into <code>splitSalt</code>, which is a 2D array of bytes. Each sub-array contains 1024 bytes</p>



<pre><code lang="go">splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
for i, block := range splitSalt {
	newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
	splitSalt[i] = newBlock
}</code></pre>



<p>where <code>roMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func roMix(block, iterations){
	v := []
	x := block
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		v[i] = x
		x = blockMix(x)
	}
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		j := integerify(x) % iterations
		x = blockMix(x ^ v[j])
	}
	return x
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>integerify</code> is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7914">RFC-7914</a> and <code>blockMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func blockMix(block){
	r := len(block) / 128
	// split block into an array of 2r 64-byte chunks
	chunks := get2r64ByteChunks()

	x := chunks[len(chunks)-1]
	y := []
	for i := 0; i &lt; len(chunks); i++{
		x = salsa20-8(x ^ chunks[i])
		y[i] = x
	}
	return [y[0], y[2], ...y[2r-2], y[1], y[3], ...y[2r-1]]
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>salsa20-8</code> is the 8-round version of the algorithm defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">here</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="4_-_Finalize_Salt">4 – Finalize Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Now <code>splitSalt</code> has been mixed in such a computationally exhausting way that we will call it an <code>expensiveSalt</code>. Expensive salt will be a single array of bytes, so we need to concatenate all the subarrays in <code>splitSalt</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="go">expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="5_-_Return_Final_KDF">5 – Return Final KDF</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)</code></pre>



<p>The final pseudocode for our top level function is as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor

	const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)

	splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
	for i, block := range splitSalt {
		newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
		splitSalt[i] = newBlock
	}

	expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)

	return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)
}</code></pre>



<p>Or, if you prefer, the pseudocode as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<pre><code lang="">Function scrypt
   Inputs:
      Passphrase:                Bytes    string of characters to be hashed
      Salt:                      Bytes    random salt
      CostFactor (N):            Integer  CPU/memory cost parameter - Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024)
      BlockSizeFactor (r):       Integer  blocksize parameter (8 is commonly used)
      ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer  Parallelization parameter. (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
      DesiredKeyLen:             Integer  Desired key length in bytes
   Output:
      DerivedKey:                Bytes    array of bytes, DesiredKeyLen long

   Step 1. Generate expensive salt
   blockSize ← 128*BlockSizeFactor  //Length (in bytes) of the SMix mixing function output (e.g. 128*8 = 1024 bytes)

   Use PBKDF2 to generate initial 128*BlockSizeFactor*p bytes of data (e.g. 128*8*3 = 3072 bytes)
   Treat the result as an array of p elements, each entry being blocksize bytes (e.g. 3 elements, each 1024 bytes)
   [B0...Bp−1] ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, Salt, 1, blockSize*ParallelizationFactor)

   Mix each block in B Costfactor times using ROMix function (each block can be mixed in parallel)
   for i ← 0 to p-1 do
      Bi ← ROMix(Bi, CostFactor)

   All the elements of B is our new "expensive" salt
   expensiveSalt ← B0∥B1∥B2∥ ... ∥Bp-1  //where ∥ is concatenation
 
   Step 2. Use PBKDF2 to generate the desired number of bytes, but using the expensive salt we just generated
   return PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, DesiredKeyLen);</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past we have <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-02-03-mapping-income-inequality-using-irs-soi-data/">blogged</a> about the IRS Sources of Income (SOI) data that we harvested and published as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/irs-soi/data/master">Dolt database</a>. We presented a compelling visualization that was relatively straightforward to create using that database. It was straightforward to create because of the work that went into transforming disparate and unruly files to a coherently presented database. Recently we <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">highlighted</a> a dataset of USPS Crosswalk mappings that are widely used into academic and commercial settings to traverse between ZIP code and other geographic statistical entities, for example counties. They are also available as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">Dolt database</a>. Finally just today we published US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/census-population-estimates">population estimates</a> by county, indexed on FIPS code going back to 2010.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive features of using Dolt and DoltHub together is how elegant they make acquiring these datasets in your local environment. There is no need to sign up, and we aren't tying you to a compute environment we will try and charge you for. They simply enable distribution of datasets along with a SQL interface. Dolt runs wherever you need it to run. Users can skip downloading, parsing, and cleaning collections of files, and begin analyzing the data immediately.</p>
<p>In this post we show how these features make it easy to combine a specifically interesting dataset, the IRS SOI data, with generally useful datasets, the USPS Crosswalk data and county level population estimates, to essentially toggle the spatial resolution of the IRS data. We conclude by advocating for the concept of a data dependency delivered as a "drop in" resource. The benefit of this model is for companies and individuals that depend on data, but do not see at as a core competency, to focus on what they do best. This is very much how open source software works.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To work through this locally you will need to get a copy of Dolt, which on <code>*nix</code> systems can be done with a single command, and we have documentation on the full range of installation options <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/#dolt">here</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ sudo bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash'</code></pre></div>
<p>For the analysis component, you will need Doltpy, which has all other libraries imported in the sample code as a dependency. It's available on PyPi:</p>

<p>For the visualization you will need several Python libraries, but they can easily be installed as follows:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>pip install plotly plotly-geo geopandas==0.3.0  pyshp==1.2.10</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's move onto to acquiring data.</p>
<h2>Acquiring data</h2>
<p>Acquiring data with Dolt is easy. Let's set up a home for our analysis:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs &amp;&amp; cd irs-analysis/dolt-dbs
$ dolt clone Liquidata/irs-soi
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/irs-soi
291,637 of 291,637 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$ dolt clone Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
210,458 of 210,458 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$  dolt clone Liquidata/census-population-estimates
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/census-population-estimates
82 of 82 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two Dolt databases in <code>~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs</code>, and we can launch the Dolt SQL shell in with the <code>--multi-db-dir</code> switch to make load them both into our SQL environment:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ ls -ltr
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  12 oscarbatori  staff  384 Jul 23 18:07 irs-soi
drwxr-xr-x   6 oscarbatori  staff  192 Jul 23 21:11 usps-crosswalk-data
$ dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
~/Documents/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs|&gt;&gt;  dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.
# Statements must be terminated with ';'.
# "exit" or "quit" (or Ctrl-D) to exit.
&gt; show databases;

| census_population_estimates |
| information_schema          |
| irs_soi                     |
| usps_crosswalk_data         |
+-----------------------------+</code></pre></div>
<p>We have now acquired two datasets, both maintained by DoltHub. We can use <code>dolt pull</code> to subscribe to changes to the datasets, making any derivative analysis we create "live."</p>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>We will be working with adjusted gross income by ZIP code, and then using the USPS Crosswalk data and county population estiamtes to translate that to county level per capita income. This works because the USPS publishes mappings from ZIP codes to various geographical statistical entities identified by FIPS code, mappings that we completely capture (across time and mapping pairs). The data includes "ratios" of residential and business addresses for pairings that are not one to one. For example a ZIP code and straddle county lines, and vice versa, and so these ratios provide a mechanism for us approximate how much of a given aggregate to apportion when we perform the mapping.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at the data to see how it looks in practice:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; use irs_soi;

<p>We can see here a bunch of ZIP codes that are completely contained within counties. These ZIP codes contain only business addresses. That's not always the cade. Let's step into Python and do some analysis.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>We saw earlier how easy it was to acquire the data from DoltHub using Dolt. The USPS Crosswalk dataset took around 450 files to build, each of them Excel files. So running a single command was a pretty big time saving, even over the narrow subset of the data we are interested in, around 50 files. Loading them into Dolt also required removing some corrupt data, so that work is now embedded in the database, and amortized over everyone that takes advantage of it.</p>
<p>This simple acquisition model is only fraction of the benefit of acquiring data via Dolt and DoltHub. The balance comes from the SQL interface that arrives with the data. We don't need to parse files, we can just use SQL's elegant declarative syntax to describe the data we are interested in, and then let the query engine deliver it to our preferred interface, in this case Python.</p>
<p>The goal of our analysis is to translate ZIP code level income data to the county level, so let's grab each dataset, and then combine them:</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>

<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the most fundamental reasons why I believe that the value of Bitcoin will continue to appreciate is because it is much easier for people to start believing in it than it is for people to stop.</p>



<p>Bitcoin believers tend to believe in it strongly and sometimes even irrationally. For many people, it is like a religion. For many more, Bitcoin has a continuous influence on their way of life not dissimilar to other modern systems of belief such as climate change and veganism. To varying degrees, Bitcoin believers will weather potentially any storm (decreases in its value, attacks in the media, etc.). Qualitatively, Bitcoin believers are quite strong.</p>



<p>Quantitatively, outside of Bitcoin’s still relatively small base of believers, there are many more people who do not sufficiently understand Bitcoin than there are people who do understand it but do not believe in it. If the last decade is any indication, a certain and probably high percentage of those who do not yet understand Bitcoin will quickly and easily come to believe in it once they do.</p>



<p>Having observed these dynamics of the Bitcoin belief system, I am near certain that non-owners are coming to believe in Bitcoin faster than owners are losing their belief. In other words, the outside population is buying into Bitcoin faster than than the inside population is selling out. This trend seems poised to continue indefinitely. As long as it does, so will the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value due to the increasing demand for the limited and finite supply.</p>



<p>One can think of Bitcoin as having a natural network effect where the owner population is expanding exponentially in comparison with an extremely low churn rate among its existing owners. It is this sort of network effect that has given rise to the most valuable companies of our time. Bitcoin is not a company but it stands to benefit just the same.</p>



<p>Quants can do all the fancy analysis they want but the simple fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is worth nothing without people’s belief in it. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, its value will plummet. If more people start believing in Bitcoin, its value will continue to appreciate. Because Bitcoin’s value is sustained solely by people’s belief in it, it seems to me that any prudent investor who makes a bullish case for Bitcoin should seek to support this most basic underlying assumption which says that the overall belief in Bitcoin is growing and will continue to grow. That is the assumption which I have sought to support with this piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In closing, it is worth stating clearly that money has no real value other than that which people believe it does. As long as people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it will be. Today it seems evident that Bitcoin believers are quickly accumulating and scarcely abandoning the asset. So long as this continues to be the case, and it seems more probable that not that it will, Bitcoin’s value will rise.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Computers are cold and heartless. They don't lie, and they don't care if you scream and swear at them. You can abuse them all day long, and they'll still efficiently flip bits and push pixels.</p><p>But... people aren't. Behind every piece of software, there's at least one human. Who has a heart, and who cares what you think. Who has hopes, and dreams, and fears. Who feels.</p><p>This is something I've been wanting to write in one form or another for quite a while now, and I've been rewriting this post for a little too long.</p><p>Sometimes it seems like we forget about the humans. Either we forget that there's a human behind the software we build, or we forget that we're shipping software <em>for people</em>. </p><p>It seems to me that more and more, especially recently, nobody can share their work or their ideas without someone stepping in and criticising their ideas. Maybe they could have written it in a language that's faster, uses less memory, <em>something about bloat or native code.</em> Maybe it doesn't have a feature that another project does, so why the hell should anyone use it? &nbsp;</p><p>I remember earlier in my career, every time I opened a PR, I'd have a small feeling of anxiety. Was it good enough? What if I'm bad at programming? Would people hate it? What if I'm wrong? Fear of failure is one of the biggest obstacles to success, and all too often it stops people from sharing or achieving what they could. The feeling of "this isn't good enough to share" goes along with that.</p><p>Even while writing this, I couldn't help but feel like it isn't quite perfect, isn't quite good enough to share. But that's the point of my blog; I want to make myself put things out there, even if they're not 100%. </p><p>We should feel like it's ok to share work that isn't finished, that doesn't use the fastest, cleanest, most optimal approach. If I've made something for fun and want to share it, why not? If it doesn't use the technology you prefer, and you haven't paid me to build it, why would you shit all over someone else's work?</p><p>Better yet. If you care that much, make your own. Instead of pulling down something of someone else's', build your own thing up.</p><p>To some degree I understand people not being satisfied with professional software, that they have paid for, and that doesn't meet their expectations. But if it's open source, free, and available for all? Why would you ever complain about that? If it's not for you, just... move on.</p><p>Friends of mine won't share their blog posts to HN, Reddit, etc, because they feel like their words aren't good enough. Or like people there are going to tear them apart. Or because they might have made a small mistake somewhere.</p><p>The main thing I can see fuelling so many arguments is an inherent <em>need</em> to be right. It's been written about so many times before, but for some reason people can't bear the idea that <strong><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone on the internet is wrong</a></strong>. </p><p>Except, when it comes to the preferences of which tools or technology someone wants to build something with, in their own time, can you really be wrong? </p><p>There's a stereotype held about people in tech, that we're all that super nerdy person who struggles socially, can't talk to people, and hide all day in the basement programming. And that somehow, this is excusable if you're <em>really good </em>at writing code. But is it? If you're writing code for people to use, and you're working on it with people, not having people skills isn't really an option. Much like technical skills, it isn't an innate quality - you can work on improving your people skills, much like you can your tech skills.</p><p>If you take anything at all from my post, hopefully it's this; if you really must say something, and you really feel like someone made the wrong choice, maybe think about your phrasing. Eg</p><blockquote>Hey! Nice work. I was curious though, why'd you pick &lt;tech&gt; over &lt;other tech&gt;?</blockquote><p>vs</p><blockquote>Ugh, this would be so much better if it just used &lt;tech&gt;. I hate the way modern tech is going</blockquote><p>Let's make our industry a much more friendly and welcoming place 💖</p>

<![CDATA[How GPT3 Works – Visualizations and Animations]]>

    <p>(Live thread, will be updated with new visuals and polish over the next few days. Join <a href="http://eepurl.com/gl0BHL">the mailing list</a> to get updated when completed)</p>

<p>A trained language model generates text.</p>

<p>We can optionally pass it some text as input, which influences its output.</p>

<p>The output is generated from what the model “learned” during its training period where it scanned vast amounts of text.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/01-gpt3-language-model-overview.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Training is the process of exposing the model to lots of text. That process has been completed. All the experiments you see now are from that one trained model. It was estimated to cost 355 GPU years and cost $4.6m.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/02-gpt3-training-language-model.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The dataset of 300 billion tokens of text is used to generate training examples for the model. For example, these are three training examples generated from the one sentence at the top.</p>

<p>You can see how you can slide a window across all the text and make lots of examples.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-training-examples-sliding-window.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The model is presented with an example. We only show it the features and ask it to predict the next word.</p>

<p>The model’s prediction will be wrong. We calculate the error in its prediction and update the model so next time it makes a better prediction.</p>

<p>Repeat millions of times</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/03-gpt3-training-step-back-prop.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Now let’s look at these same steps with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>GPT3 actually generates output one token at a time (let’s assume a token is a word for now).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/04-gpt3-generate-tokens-output.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Please note: This is a description of how GPT-3 works and not a discussion of what is novel about it (which is mainly the ridiculously large scale). The architecture is a transformer decoder model based on this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf</p>

<p>GPT3 is MASSIVE. It encodes what it learns from training in 175 billion numbers (called parameters). These numbers are used to calculate which token to generate at each run.</p>

<p>The untrained model starts with random parameters. Training finds values that lead to better predictions.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-parameters-weights.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>These numbers are part of hundreds of matrices inside the model. Prediction is mostly a lot of matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=mSTCzNgDJy4">Intro to AI on YouTube</a>, I showed a simple ML model with one parameter. A good start to unpack this 175B monstrosity.</p>

<p>To shed light on how these parameters are distributed and used, we’ll need to open the model and look inside.</p>

<p>GPT3 is 2048 tokens wide. That is its “context window”. That means it has 2048 tracks along which tokens are processed.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/05-gpt3-generate-output-context-window.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Let’s follow the purple track. How does a system process the word “robotics” and produce “A”?</p>

<p>High-level steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert the word to <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">a vector (list of numbers) representing the word</a></li>
  <li>Compute prediction</li>
  <li>Convert resulting vector to word</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/06-gpt3-embedding.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The important calculations of the GPT3 occur inside its stack of 96 transformer decoder layers.</p>

<p>See all these layers? This is the “depth” in “deep learning”.</p>

<p>Each of these layers has its own 1.8B parameter to make its calculations. That is where the “magic” happens. This is a high-level view of that process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/07-gpt3-processing-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>You can see a detailed explanation of everything inside the decoder in my blog post <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT2</a>.</p>

<p>The difference with GPT3 is the alternating dense and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf">sparse self-attention layers</a>.</p>

<p>This is an X-ray of an input and response (“Okay human”) within GPT3. Notice how every token flows through the entire layer stack. We don’t care about the output of the first words. When the input is done, we start caring about the output. We feed every word back into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/08-gpt3-tokens-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>In the React code generation example (https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264), the description would be the input prompt (in green), in addition to a couple of examples of description=&gt;code, I believe. And the react code would be generated like the pink tokens here token after token.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the priming examples and the description are appended as input, with specific tokens separating examples and the results. Then fed into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/09-gpt3-generating-react-code-example.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>It’s impressive that this works like this. Because you just wait until fine-tuning is rolled out for the GPT3. The possibilities will be even more amazing.</p>

<p>Fine-tuning actually updates the model’s weights to make the model better at a certain task.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/10-gpt3-fine-tuning.gif">

July 27, 2020 | https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="http://term.ink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink 3</a> is available today.
Ink lets you build command-line apps using React and have fun while doing so too.</p><p>Ink is a special project to me, because it's been surreal to watch how a tiny experiment grew into a full-featured command-line UI toolkit that's used by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://node-tap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap</a>, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/tree/master/scripts/splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/kyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#whos-using-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.
I had no idea it had such a great future when I was just playing with React trying to make it render things to a string and output it in the terminal.</p><p>I'm excited to share all the updates with you, so let's dive right in to see what Ink 3 has to offer.</p><p>While it's not so much of a feature, I think it deserves a top spot.
People loved using React to declaratively build UIs for their command-line apps, but sometimes it ended up hurting their end performance.
For example, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> noticed their build process slowed down, which is obviously not the tradeoff I want Ink's users to accept.</p><p>Ink 3 got rid of quite a few rendering bugs and in some cases I observed a 2x performance improvement when there's a high frequency of re-renders.
Text rendering and the whole support for Flexbox was rethinked from the ground up and rewritten.
It's also much simpler than it was before, which makes issues easier to debug, reproduce and solve.</p><p>Previous version of Ink had multiple hacky workarounds for various layout issues, so it didn't always render what you would expect.

Think of <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> as a terminal-specific implementation for a <a href="http://www.reactvirtualized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual list</a> technique, where only necessary items are rendered.
<code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> renders all new items above the rest of your UI permanently, which means you can't update them once they are displayed.
This makes <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> a perfect candidate for tools like Jest, where hundreds of completed tests could need to be logged.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Static</span><span> </span><span>items</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'Test #1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #2'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #3'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>,</span><span> index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      Completed </span><span>{</span><span>test</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Static</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> is almost twice as performant as it was before and API has been simplified to match libraries like <a href="https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-tiny-virtual-list</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of a UI similar to Jest, where completed tests are rendered using <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code>.</p><video src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/static.mp4" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" width="500"></video><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#static" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component</a>.</p><p>Yes, you read that right.
You can use React Devtools to inspect the output of your Ink app.
The magical bit is that you can actually change the props of any component and see your CLI update on the fly without having to restart it.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/devtools.jpg" alt="Integration with React Devtools"><span>Integration with React Devtools</span></p><p>You don't need to make any changes to support it, just set <code>DEV=true</code> environment variable and open Devtools:</p><div><pre>$ DEV=true node examples/counter
$ npx react-devtools
</pre></div><p>When one of your components throws an error, React displays a quite verbose error message to the console and a long stack trace.
Most often that stack trace isn't super useful, because it points to React internals.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a simpler and cleaner solution to this problem by defining a global React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">error boundary</a> and rendering a beautiful overview of the error.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/errors.jpg" alt="Error handler UI"><span>Error handler UI</span></p><p>To improve developer UX further, Ink 3 intercepts calls to <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.error</code> and other methods to ensure logs are displayed correctly above your app's UI and not interfere with each other.
This is necessary, because Ink re-renders your UI all the time, which can overwrite the output from <code>console.log</code>.</p><p>If your app has more than one user input displayed at once, it can become tricky to detect which input has the focus and should receive data.
To make this easier, Ink offers two new React hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> - Receive focus.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Manage focus programmatically.</li></ul><p>When component calls <code>useFocus</code> hook, it notifies Ink that there's a new focusable component in the UI.
Each time user presses Tab, Ink is going to pass focus to the next focusable component in the queue.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'First item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'First item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Example</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>In the example above, as user presses Tab, focus will be passed back and forth between <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> components.</p><p>When your app needs to manage focus manually, without waiting on user input, you can use <code>useFocusManager</code> hook.

Streaming is undoubtedly the future of entertainment.</p><p>But there is one problem — the problem I refer to as <strong>The Entertainment Loop</strong>. To understand the problem, we have to understand how Netflix (and similar services) make money. It's actually fairly simple.</p><h2 id="how-making-money-works-in-the-21st-century">How Making Money Works in the 21st Century</h2><p>In just one single word: Subscription. For a small monthly fee you, as a company, provide a good service to your customer. This has two main advantages over the old school "pay once and get something" sales tactic:</p><ol><li>Due to the relatively small fee you are able to reach a large customer audience in comparison to a high (one-time)-fee.</li><li>If you, as a company, are able to successfully bind the paying customer to your service, the monthly compounding fee outgrows the large "one-time-fee" that you could've charged instead.</li></ol><p>It is important to understand these two advantages and why companies decide for a monthly subscription business instead of a one-time-fee business. There are additional advantages in the subscription-based model, but we'll keep it simple for now.</p><p>These two advantages are the key to Netflix success. That's the good (probably awesome) part of the story. But here comes the story: These two advantages <strong>will cause damage </strong>to your company in the future.</p><p>To understand why, we'll have to understand, how Netflix makes money.</p><h2 id="how-netflix-makes-money">How Netflix Makes Money</h2><p>Netflix makes money by selling monthly subscriptions in exchange for unlimited movies and tv &nbsp;on their platform. That's it. It's that simple.</p><p>Let's think about the service in exchange for the monthly fee, to understand the problem: Unlimited streaming of movies and tv series.</p><p>Netflix main goal is to make the user stay and keep paying. For reach that ultimate goal, Netflix has to deliver value to the user. Every month — or he will leave and stop paying the monthly fee. That's why Netflix has to keep pushing new content for every users' own (movie-)taste. Once the user doesn't receive any new value from Netflix, he will stop paying for the service. And Netflix only way to provide value is to deliver movies and tv-series.</p><p>I'm pretty sure that you understood this, but let me try to clarify (and simplify) it with a flow chart:</p><figure><img src="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Entertainment-Loop-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Broken down to one line: <strong>Netflix will not earn any money, if they don't add new content.</strong></p><h2 id="how-netflix-can-solve-this-problem-and-why-it-isn-t-easy">How Netflix can solve this problem and why it isn't easy</h2><p>Netflix can solve this problem by adding new content (surprise!). But they will encounter a second problem, if they keep adding content: Costs.</p><p>Let's think it through. The loop goes like this:</p><ol><li>Netflix adds content</li><li>Costs increase</li><li>New (paying) subscribers join because of the new content</li><li>Existing subscribers are happy and keep paying</li><li>Newly added content gets old and boring</li><li>Less new (paying) subscribers</li><li>Existing subscribers get bored and start leaving</li><li>Netflix has to add new content</li><li>Go to #1</li></ol><p>That is the Entertainment Loop. And it is nearly impossible to break out of it.</p><p>And this is just the start of the problem. The key here is, that Netflix has to add more and more new content to make existing customers happy. But they not only need the existing customers, they will need new customers to cover the increasing costs. And the costs will increase because, you might already guess it, Netflix has to deliver value (content) to the existing customers to make them stay (and keep them happy).</p><p>But the number of new (paying) subscribers isn't increasing from month to month. It will flatten in decline. Reason for that is, that the number of potential new customers is finite. There are not (!) unlimited new possible subscriber.</p><p>The real trouble starts once Netflix approaches the limit of adding new subscribers. New and fresh money stops floating in like the year before, but the expectations for new value (new content) of the existing customers is not declining — it is staying at least the same or the expectation will even increase.</p><p>So Netflix will have to deliver even more new value in form of content like movies and tv series. And that increases the costs — again. And now Netflix is in a situation, where the costs keep increasing (or staying the same) but the money they earn from paying subscribers will not increase that much. And that is the Entertainment Loop.</p><h2 id="first-counterargument-against-this">First counterargument against this</h2><p>Actually, do the costs keep increasing? You might deny this question. Each month, Netflix need more or less the same amount of new movies and tv series to keep the subscribers happy and paying. So the costs stay more or less the same, don't they? The answer is yes... but actually, no.</p><p>The costs keep increasing. And that's why:</p><p>First of, the expectations for new content keeps increasing. That makes the production more expensive.</p><p>Second, Netflix' new subscribes are not <em>mainstream</em> subscribers. The "normal" subscriber who likes mainstream movies and tv series has already subscribed to Netflix. Netflix gains more and more subscribers who want to the <em>non-mainstream</em> content. That keeps increasing the costs as Netflix has to produce more and more of the <em>non-mainstream </em>content.</p><p>That keeps the costs increasing.</p><p>Of course, if a new subscriber joins, he'll be happy for some time, because he can watch all the content that Netflix added over the time when he wasn't a subscriber. But at some point, he'll run out of existing content to consume. Then Netflix has to deliver new content, to keep him happy and subscribing.</p><h2 id="second-counterargument-against-this">Second counterargument against this</h2><p>Netflix could just increase its prices for a subscription step by step. Increasing the costs, by, let's say 10%, would increase Netflix revenue immediately. And a 10% price increase wouldn't hurt the user.</p><p>Problem with that is, that Netflix cannot create a monopoly. Unlike famous companies like Apple, anyone could build a streaming business. The technology is fairly simple (I mean, it is very complicated, but if you hire a lot of good software engineers and product managers, it would be possible to create a streaming service like Netflix has). And it is very hard to bind users to the value Netflix delivers: Movies and tv series. Of course, there will be some people who want to see the next season of a Netflix Original. But different producers could also create a tv series which binds users to it. In addition, it isn't very profitable for a company to produce a large number of seasons for a tv series.</p><p>That's because every additional season of a tv series costs more money to a company than the previous one. Why? Because who wants to see the following season? Only the people who also watch the previous one. Or did you ever said "damn, I really want to see season 5 of the show x", without having watched season 1 to 4 of show x? Producing a new season of a tv series will not make a company more money than the previous one. That's why it is incredible hard to bind users to a movie/tv-series business. Creating good content is interchangeable.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This entertainment loop happens to every movie subscription company. I referred to Netflix as a practical example, because this company is the current #1 in the streaming-universe.</p><p>I have no business relation to Netflix or any of their competitors besides being invested in their stocks via global index funds (ETF).</p><p>And yes — I'm a happy customer of Netflix. As long as they deliver new content.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

      <p>Quick challenge: Can you name all of the apps on your smartphone’s home screen without looking?</p>

<p>Now consider your living room - can you name most of the physical products?</p>

<p>If you’re like most of us, you probably have a television, a gaming console like a PS5, maybe an AppleTV or Roku, and if you’re into home fitness, a <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/">Peloton</a> or <a href="https://www.mirror.co/">Mirror</a>. They sit on your media console. Next to your television. In the corner looking out the window. Waiting silently. Beckoning you to engage.</p>

<p>The typical silicon valley mantra over the past decade has been that hardware is hard and the margins are unforgiving. An industry best to be avoided. And by and large this belief was correct, until recently.</p>

<p>With the advent of internet connected devices and subscription business models, hardware is experiencing a renaissance through cloud connectivity.</p>

<p>Companies like Peloton, Mirror, as well as your AppleTV and your gaming console have all figured out ways to provide enhanced internet-enabled content &amp; community experiences using physical hardware as a trojan horse to infiltrate your living room.</p>

<p>When you consider the consistent presence of a beautifully designed physical product in a home - you almost can’t put a price tag on its marketing power. I’ve known people who purchase iMacs just because of the way they make a room <em>feel</em> - even though the computer is rarely used. You can’t tell me the Apple brand isn’t silently permeating that household.</p>

<p>Now that connected hardware is able to leverage high margin subscription business models, expect to see more innovation in connected, beautifully designed hardware around your home.</p>

<p>Many of the new exercise apps on the iPhone are missing an important opportunity to establish a type of “gravity” in the living room. They’re trying to leverage push notifications and instagram ads to get user attention - but most of us are so inundated with ads and push notifications, we’re never going to notice. <strong>They should be building hardware accessories that enhance application experiences and integrate naturally into our physical space.</strong></p>

<p>As we walk around the house, we can’t ignore the beautifully designed stationary bike. Or the well placed mirror on the wall, silently reminding us there are thousands of livestream classes and workout buddies available instantaneously.</p>

<p>Application developers need to be thinking beyond the screen and claiming physical space in our lives. It might cost more money to get into someone’s living room - but it’s also more difficult to get rid of a 60kg carbon steel stationary bike than it is to delete an application from your smartphone.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I have contacted my broker about this privately, and asked them to confirm that they are not using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE754 floating point numbers</a> for calculations involving money.
They refused to confirm that they are not using IEEE754 floating point numbers for calculations involving money.
They have also explicitly stated that "All entries on your account are rounded to the nearest cent." and they have made it clear that they do not see this as a problem.
I have also offered my services, as someone who has experience with getting things like this exactly right, but I did not get a response to that offer.</p>
<p>If you have only come here to get outraged about how my broker does not care about the correctness of their software and their accounting, you can stop reading now.
The rest of this blogpost will be a detailed explanation of the problems at hand and how to solve them.</p>
<h2>Problems with money</h2>
<p>Because computers are really good at doing computations, you might think that they must therefore be good at dealing with money.
However, money is a very complex subject.
There are all sorts of pitfalls, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/rgs/6509585">this list of falsehoods</a> is a good place to start learning about them.</p>
<h3>Money as a floating point value</h3>
<p>If you take away one thing from this blogpost, let it be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must NOT store monetary values as IEEE 754 floating point numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corollary: Given that this is the only numeric format that JavaScript has, this implies that you must not use JavaScript for calculations with currency.</p>
<p>These are the primary reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculations involving floating point numbers usually have some amount of error.</li>
<li>Many floating point numbers do not make sense as a value of money.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating money out of thin air using floating point calculations</h3>
<p>Floating point number calculations usually have some error.
As an example, let us have a look at the value $0.1$, which cannot represented accurately using an IEEE754 floating point number.
You can tell this by looking at <code>0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004
</code></pre>
<p>This means that when you get a dime from a customer three times, and store it as a floating number, you will have effectively created <code>0.00000000000000004</code> USD out of thin air.
This might not seem like much (even though it does not need to be much, it is still wrong), but this error grows as the values in your calculations grow.
There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis">an entire field of mathematics</a> dedicated to thinking about what happens to the errors depending on what types of calculations you are performing.</p>
<h3>Representing nonsense values of money</h3>
<p>The IEEE754 Floating point number spec defines <code>NaN</code>, <code>+Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity</code>.
These make no sense when interpreting them as monetary values.
I have to mention this because these values form a real problem in practice.</p>
<p>You might be thinking: OK, but I take good care not to run into issues with these non-normalised floating point values.
You are still wrong, but let us assume you are not.
You will still run into the next problem</p>
<h4>Minimal quantisations</h4>
<p>The smallest denomination of US dollar that you can hold or transact is <code>0.01 USD</code>: a penny.
Any amount of US dollars more granular than that does not exist in coins and cannot usually be transacted.
(You can still potentially have more granular debts, as you will see below.)</p>
<p>Even worse: different currencies have different minimal quantisations.
In Switzerland, where I am using my broker, the smallest coin of a Swiss Frank is 5 "rappen": <code>0.05 CHF</code>.
The transaction granularity goes down to <code>0.01 CHF</code> in bank transactions but no lower than that either.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to begin talking about solutions, let us clarify what needs to be possible in the system that we produce:</p>
<h4>Addition</h4>
<ol>
<li>We must be able to add up amounts of money.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful to keep a running balance, for example.</p>
<p>The additions must happen in such a way that the representation of the sum equals the sum of the representations.
Otherwise we might create or destroy money via addition.</p>
<p>For example, <code>0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1</code> must somehow equal <code>0.3</code> and not <code>0.30000000000000004</code>.</p>
<h4>Integral Multiplication</h4>
<ol start="2">
<li>We must be able to multiply amounts of money by an integer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful to find out how much multiple units of an item would cost, in the case of integral multiples.</p>
<p>You will notice that if you can solve the problem of addition, then you have also solved the problem of correct integral multiplication
However, ideally, an integral multiplication would take up the same amount of time as a single addition, not a linear multiple of it.
We would like to have multiplication be efficient as well as correct.</p>
<p>For example, <code>3.33 x 3</code> must equal <code>9.99</code> and not <code>10</code>.</p>
<h4>Division by an integer</h4>
<ol start="3">
<li>We must be able to divide an amount of money by an integer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful for dividing a payment into installments.
Here it is important that the sum of the installments equals the amount that was divided.</p>
<p>For example, <code>10 / 3</code> must be divided into three times <code>3.33</code> and an extra <code>0.01</code> somewhere: <code>3.34 + 3.33 + 3.33</code>.</p>
<h4>Fractional Multiplication</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li>We must be able to multiply amounts of money by a fraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful for calculating interest rates, taxes and dividends, for example.</p>
<p>It <em>should</em> happen in such a way that the representation of the product equals the product of the representations.
Failing that (because we'll see that this is impossible), it should at least not create or destroy money.</p>
<p>For example, <code>0.1</code> times <code>0.11 USD</code>, using a minimal quantisation of <code>0.01 USD</code>, should result in <code>0.01 USD</code>.
The representational error which mathematically equals <code>0.001</code> should be dealt with <em>somehow</em>.</p>
<h4>Accurate Accounting</h4>
<ol start="5">
<li>We must be able to accurately account for every smallest unit of currency.</li>
</ol>
<p>When earning or spending money, we must be able to account for every smallest unit of currency in play.
No such units be created or destroyed, and no amounts smaller than the smallest unit may be accounted for.</p>
<p>Note that you can choose a different minimal quantisation of currency in your accounting system than is used for bank transactions.
Even if banks use <code>0.01 CHF</code> as a minimal transaction value, you can still use <code>0.0001 CHF</code> as a minimal quantisation internally.
The only real constraints are correctness: you do not create or destroy money and storage size.
Dealing with more precise numbers requires more storage.</p>
<p>When you choose a different minimal quantisation of currency internally than the one you show to users, you have to somehow make that conversion.
When you do, it is important that you don't add any mistakes back in.</p>
<p>This is likely what my broker did wrong.
They probably used rounding from 4 decimals (a common standard) to 2 decimals and introduced rounding errors in the process.</p>
<h4>Granular pricing</h4>
<ol start="6">
<li>We must be able to make calculations with values smaller than the smallest unit of currency</li>
</ol>
<p>The utility of this requirement may not be obvious.
However, when dealing with an item of large volume and cost such as oil, we want to be able to reason about (and compete on) the (average) price of a small amount of it.
In such a case it may be necessary to reason about currency in units smaller than its minimal quantisation.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to rent out digital storage for $0.000023$ USD per kilobyte per month, that rate is like expressed in a more precise granularity then your system deals with.
In that case we must still be able to rent out $2'000'000$ kilobyte for a month for <code>46.00 USD</code>.</p>
<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>It is already clear that we must not represent currency as floating point numbers.
Instead, we must use a representation with infinite precision: integers.</p>
<p>For the purposes of all but the special case of 'granular pricing', we <em>must</em> use integers to represent currency.
For each individual currency we will represent an amount of it as an integral number of its smallest units.</p>
<p>For example, <code>1 USD</code> could be represented as <code>100</code> at a minimal quantisation of <code>0.01 USD</code> because <code>100 x 0.01 USD = 1 USD</code> and 1 CHF could be represented as <code>20</code> at a minimal quantisation of <code>0.05 CHF</code> because <code>20 x 0.05 CHF = 1 CHF</code>.
If you choose a smaller minimal quantisation, such as <code>0.0001 CHF</code>, then you would represent <code>1 CHF</code> as <code>1000</code> instead.
Given that the minimal quantisation is not obvious, make sure to document it well (and/or put it on the type-level).</p>
<p>In an ideal world you would use arbitrarily-sized integers, but often you may be forced to use bounded representations with fixed limits.
It is possible to accommodate such constraints but the trade-offs, as you will read next, are real and should be considered carefully.
In what follows we will continue by assuming you are using (bounded-size) integer numbers.</p>
<h3>Addition and integer multiplication</h3>
<p>Addition of integers is relatively simple and well supported.
However, most implementations of addition are not suitable for use with fixed-sized integer representations.
Indeed, most implementations of addition will just roll over around the bounds.</p>
<p>For example, consider a situation in which you are a bank and you store amounts of money as <code>int32</code>.
A very wealthy client of yours has about twenty million dollars.
You save this information as "this client has two billion cents".
A bit later, he earns another two million dollars, but when the money is sent to him, suddenly the system says that he is millions in of dollars in debt.
There are two big issues with this scenario: 1. The client has lost money and 2. The …</p></div></div>

					<p>#Noise #pollution is one of the main stressors in urban environments, having negative impacts on people’s quality of life and health. For some groups of citizens, such as school children, patients, and elders, there is a need to support them in finding pedestrian routes in noise polluted areas of cities. In<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139350" target="_blank"> a new paper</a>, <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">we</a> focus on the <strong>estimation of traffic noise</strong>, and present an approach to <strong>provide quiet routing services</strong>, <em>taking into account the estimated noise levels of roads</em>.</p>
<p>By combining Volunteered Geographic Information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), official socio-economic data, and open-access GPS trajectory data, we develop a set of traffic related variables, and apply machine learning methods to perform<strong> traffic volume estimations</strong>. Given the estimated traffic information, an existing traffic noise model is then employed to derive the noise polluted areas. For generation of quiet routes, a new routing algorithm is proposed. It minimizes the exposure of pedestrians to traffic noise pollution while taking into account the route distance constraint. We apply our quiet routing approach to the city of Heidelberg (Germany). The application results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in the generation of quiet routes customized to pedestrian preferences.</p>

<p>In earlier work we looked already into generating customized pleasant pedestrian routes based on several factors like greenness, noise and sociability, and added this to <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" target="_blank">Openrouteservice</a> by <a href="http://heigit.org/" target="_blank">HeiGIT</a> &amp; <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">GIScience HD</a>:</p>

<p>Also currently we started to <a href="http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2020/06/19/going-green-with-meingrun-today-app-launch-in-heidelberg-and-dresden/">test related approaches in Dresden and Heidelberg</a> in the context of the <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/meingruen_en.html" target="_blank">meinGrün</a> project.<br>
This builds upon early work by <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/md/chemgeo/geog/gis/arcviewbuch-zipf-roether.pdf" target="_blank">Zipf and Röther (2000)</a>, But nowadays the needed data sources are much more available, so that it becomes possible to scale these ideas to new levels using open data which allow to finetune and evaluate the approach using real world data.</p>

              <p>Hyperbolic Floors maps hundreds of floors across the world to tessellations in Hyperbolic space. The result is a novel way to look at floor tilings and their infinite nature.</p>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any

pure numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Most blocked resources:</strong> USA Today (46)</li><li><strong>Least blocked resources:</strong> BBC News (9) and The New York Times (9)</li><li><strong>Average over 15 websites:</strong> 23 Resources Blocked</li></ul><p>However, if you’re looking for an answer as to which one is the safest to read your news – I guess it would BBC or NYT <em>based on the numbers alone</em>. A lot of people have their favourites and many simply don’t trust certain news platforms so in the end the decision is on you. Treat this only as a fair warning, or something which you should pay attention to.</p><p>I guess the real question isn’t which one is safe, it’s rather where is it safe. If you’re sure your browser is blocking enough of it, you don’t have much to worry about. You have very less chances of finding a website that does 0 tracking – so you should be equipped to protect yourself from those that do. If you’re an Android user, consider reading the news using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch">Snap Search 😁</a></p><p>Please remember this was completely out of curiosity while testing the latest version of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap Search</a>.

<p>Slack is awesome. It’s visually pleasing &amp; my not-technically-savvy friends have no trouble using it. It’s nice (or not nice?) to have one app that would handle personal messages and work conversations.</p>



<p>But I’ve been working strictly on my 15” Macbook Pro, without additional screen real estate, and it’s clear that Slack takes up much more screen area than it needs to do it’s job.</p>

<p>I’ve blurred out the messages/channels for privacy, but I don’t see any reason why the sidebar should be non-collapsible. Certainly, a lot of enterprise clients have enough screen space (2+ monitors) to not have a worry about thus, but at this point, with so many users and success, Slack should have the bandwidth to make their applications responsive.</p>



<p>If I want my Slack window to be non-intrusive, I should be able to shrink it and see something like this:</p>

<p>With the introduction of iOS apps running on Apple Silicon, at the least we’ll be able to run the Slack iOS app, which is very close to what I’ve sketched out.</p>

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	If there was any hope that a global pandemic would help slow down Toronto's booming housing market this new listing proves that’s not the case.</p>
<p>
	A tiny two-bedroom, one bathroom home on Euclid Street in Little Italy has just hit the market for $999,999.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The "rare detached bungalow located in the heart of Toronto" is advertised as being a "great size" with "loads of potential."</p>

	<a href="https://purplebricks.ca/on/toronto-york-region-durham/toronto/home-for-sale/hab-300-euclid-ave-ia4110230#description" target="_blank">The bungalow</a>, which has a detached garage, is just steps away from shops, restaurants, bars, parks, schools, and public transit, the listing says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Property taxes on the home will set you back $5,307 per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to a report from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board earlier this month, home sales in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and prices are on the rise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="House3" src="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5040287!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.png"></p>
<p>
	The real estate board said there were 8,701 homes sold in June, down 1.4 per cent compared with the same month last year.</p>
<p>
	On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales in June were up 84 per cent compared with May.</p>
<p>
	The average selling price in the GTA was $930,869, up 11.9 per cent compared with June 2019.</p>

  <p><span>27 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and
there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired
information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an
abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored.</p>

<p>In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and
how they fit together when writing your own.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-disk">Structuring the disk</h2>
<p>When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is
written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives
don’t have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it
is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file
system to make sense of it all.</p>

<p>A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the
majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store
metadata that is essential for the file system operation.</p>

<p>The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the
information on the disk:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_filesystem_blocks.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>File system structure in a disk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means.</p>

<h3 id="superblock-and-bitmaps">Superblock and bitmaps</h3>

<p>The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the
following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how
many are free, etc.</p>

<p>Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index
in the bitmap set to <code>0</code> indicates a free slot, and an index set to <code>1</code>
indicates an occupied slot.</p>

<h3 id="inode">Inode</h3>

<p>The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as
permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved
in an inode.</p>

<p>The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the <em>inode table</em> as the
following figure shows.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_inode_table.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode table (detailed view)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For each slot in the inode bitmap set to <code>1</code>, there will be a corresponding
inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table.
And this explains the name inode being a short name for <em>index node</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-blocks">Data blocks</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data
belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different
purposes which we will see shortly.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-to-data">Pointing to data</h2>

<p>The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the
file. The simplest way is to have <strong>direct pointers</strong>. In this case, each
pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that
large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can
have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use
<strong>indirect pointers</strong>, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to
blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is
added with <strong>double indirect pointers</strong>. And for even larger files, <strong>triple
indirect pointers</strong> are put to use.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_direct_pointers.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode multi-level index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let’s run an
example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the
majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up
to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect
pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4
GiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around
4 TiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup> + 1024<sup>3</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example,
a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can
be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk.</p>

<p>Some file systems use <strong>extents</strong> to help with this situation. In this approach,
there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the
address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example
above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB.
Multiple extents can be used to support larger files.</p>

<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn’t a specific structure for directories. The
reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories.
The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks.
Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the
form of <code>(name, index number)</code> so when looking up a particular file (or another
directory), the system uses the <code>name</code> to find the corresponding inode.</p>

<p>Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of
files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using
binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a
balanced search tree could also be used.</p>

<h2 id="access-paths">Access paths</h2>

<h3 id="read">Read</h3>

<p>When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path,
visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file.
Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults
which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them.</p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding
inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate
the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to
the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the
bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to
the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when
creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also
has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a
new inode.</p>

<h2 id="gotenksfs">GotenksFS</h2>

<p>As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I’m learning
the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this
section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the
disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1
KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4
KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size.</p>

<h3 id="mkfs"><code>mkfs</code></h3>

<p>The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for
the file system. This is achieved via the <code>mkfs</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img <span>-s</span> <span>"10 GiB"</span> <span>-b</span> 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and
each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB.</p>

<p>In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root
directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its
corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be
necessary for the next step: mounting the file system.</p>

<h3 id="mount"><code>mount</code></h3>

<p>After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The
<code>mount</code> command is used for this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you can see some information about it:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>File system after mounting</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</h3>

<p>The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the
configuration values provided in the <code>mkfs</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Superblock</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of
<code>n</code> blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the
ones where user data will be written.</p>

<p>The inode is defined as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Inode</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that
for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB.
The number of direct pointers is set to 12:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using
the definition below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Directory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>BTreeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>OsString</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="block-groups">Block groups</h3>

<p>The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity
for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an <code>Inode</code> to 128 bytes; the
corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for
structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the
corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for
user data.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, we can create <em>block groups</em> that will always have one
block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks
contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for
user data.</p>

<!--
For a disk as in our case of 10 GiB, how many blocks should be dedicated to inode bitmaps?

Increasing the number of blocks to be inode bitmaps reduces the amount of available data blocks. And reducing the number of inode bitmaps restricts the total number of files supported by the system.

Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of.

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>price</span> <span>INT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>price</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>);</span>


<span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>customer</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>customer</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>name</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>customer</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>100000</span><span>);</span>


<span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>sale</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>customer_id</span> <span>int</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 18.413 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_customer_fk</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FOREIGN</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>customer</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>);</span>
<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 5.464 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>sale_created_ix</span> <span>ON</span> <span>sale</span><span>(</span><span>created</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE INDEX</span>
<span>Time: 12.605 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>

<span>Time: 15410.234 ms (00:15.410)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table.

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>
<span>----+-------------------+----------</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        1</span>

Qualcomm’s new Quick Charge 5 promises to do just that. Qualcomm today announced its proprietary Quick Charge 5 charging solution that promises 0 to 50 percent battery with just 5 minutes of recharge.</p><p>Announcing the Quick Charge 5.0, Qualcomm said that the new charging solution will be available on its latest Snapdragon 865 and Snapdragon 865 Plus processors. Other SoCs will also get the Quick Charge 5 feature in the future says Qualcomm <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2020/07/27/qualcomm-announces-worlds-fastest-commercial-charging-solution-quick-charge">press release</a>.</p><h2>Qualcomm Quick Charge 5 features</h2><p>First, the big boasts; Qualcomm says that Quick Charge 5 is the world’s fastest commercial charging solution and the world’s first commercial 100W+ charging platform. According to Qualcomm, Quick Charge 5 can charge a 4,500 mAh battery from 0 to 50 percent battery power in just five minutes, representing the fastest mobile phone charging capabilities available.</p><p>Quick Charge 5 uses Qualcomm Battery Saver and the new Qualcomm <strong>Smart Identification of Adapter Capabilities</strong> technology for efficiency and extends the battery life cycle on a users’ smartphone/tablet. Qualcomm adds that Quick Charge is 70 percent more efficient than Quick Charge 4 and offers 10 times the power delivery of Quick Charge 1. (Qualcomm’s boast is based on internal tests charging a 4500mAh fast charge battery (1.5C charge rate) and using the maximum power for a thermal limit of 40C for all charging implementations. Charge time based on 0%-50%.)</p><blockquote><p>Quick Charge 5 incorporates 12 separate voltage, current and temperature protections, including USB-input overvoltage protection at 25V and external power controls beyond 30V. It also runs 10 degrees Celsius cooler than Quick Charge 4. Quick Charge 5 enables Dual/Triple Charge technology, adaptive input voltage, INOV4, Qualcomm Battery Saver and the new Qualcomm Smart Identification of Adapter Capabilities technology, which work together to maximize power transfer efficiency, increase safety and help extend the battery life cycle on a users’ device.</p><p>Qualcomm</p></blockquote><p>Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 5 supports 100W+ charging power and comes with better thermal management.</p><h2>Quick Charge 5 optimized for USB Type-C charging</h2><p>With more and more smartphone manufacturers moving towards Type-C ports, Qualcomm says that Quick Charge 5 is fully optimized for USB-PD and USB Type-C. Most high-end Android smartphones/tablets feature Snapdragon SoCs and Quick Charge will be made available to them says Qualcomm.</p><p>Xiaomi could be the first one to offer Quick Charge 5 to its users. Xiaomi vice president, Zhang Lei says,&nbsp;“Xiaomi has always been committed to proactively driving the adoption of new technologies and accelerating the fulfillment of enhanced experiences. In the future, more Xiaomi users will be able to enjoy high-speed, safe, and superior charging experiences enabled by Quick Charge 5.”</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

employer Facebook, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates.</em></strong></p>

<p>I have been spending a lot of time at home and doing a lot of readings on
distributed systems during the pandemic. Recently I noticed that the main
observation of Heidi Howard’s <a href="https://fpaxos.github.io/" target="_blank">Flexible Paxos (FPaxos)</a> work is applicable to Raft. Heidi
Howard already <a href="https://github.com/fpaxos/raft.tla" target="_blank">extended Raft’s TLA+ proof</a> for that. There is also a few
open source Raft implementations that mention FPaxos, but as far as I see nobody
has implemented the idea yet.</p>

<p>I analyzed the <em>simple quorums</em> and <em>improved majority quorums</em> settings of
FPaxos in the context of Raft consensus algorithm, and had a few interesting
findings. I wanted to present my findings in a concise way, so I wrote a short
paper for it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Improved Majority Quorums for Raft</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Raft has gained widespread adoption in the industry as a newcomer, thanks to
its pragmatic approach to the distributed consensus problem. Also, its
resemblance to Paxos allows it to benefit from decades of research on Paxos.
In this work, we study simple quorums and improved majority quorums of FPaxos in
the context of Raft consensus algorithm. Even-sized clusters are prone to a
greater risk of unavailability compared to odd-sized clusters because of the
majority quorum requirement. Our main finding, which applies equally to Raft and
Multi-Paxos, shows that even-sized clusters can employ improved majority quorums
to obtain the same degree of availability as odd-sized ones with one less
server. We also use improved majority quorums to simplify Raft cluster
membership changes. Our solution minimizes availability gaps during cluster
membership changes without any extra phase or voting state. We expect existing
Raft implementations to utilize our findings with quite small code changes.</em></p>

<p>(rebyC, Hard, 406 pts)</p>

<p>Author: Egor Zaytsev (@groke)</p>

<p>I created a simple service that encrypts flag (and your data) with RC4! I bet you can’t the extract flag from there :)</p>

<p>crcrcr-cybrics2020.ctf.su/</p>

<p>Source code: <a href="https://tcode2k16.github.io/blog/2020-07-27-cybrics-writeup/crcrcr.tar.gz">crcrcr.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>Hint at 20:00 — When I wanna know how Python objects are stored in memory, I can do:</p>

<pre><code>terminal1:
python3
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = b"qweqweqweqwe";
terminal2: gcore `pidof python3`
</code></pre>

<p>And then look at resulting core file, get xref to qweqweqeqwe, and try to find out how Python objects are stored in memory.</p>

<p>And I guess I will be happy to find cipher.S (rc4 state) in the coredump</p>



<p>The source code for this task is provided, so the logical first step would be to read it.</p>

<p>The server is made up of two components the flask part that handles user interaction and an encryption program named <code>cryptor.py</code>.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the flask component:</p>

<pre><code>from flask import render_template, flash, redirect,url_for, request, session, send_file
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
from app import app
from app.forms import CreateForm
import hashlib
import os

root_dir = "/app"

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
    form = CreateForm()
    return render_template('home.html', title='Make your try', form=form)

@app.route('/get_files', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    form = CreateForm()
    try:
        foldername = f"data/upload/{hashlib.sha1(os.urandom(32)).hexdigest()}"

        curr_dir = os.getcwd()
        os.mkdir(foldername)
        os.chdir(foldername)
        input_file = open("input", "w")
        input_file.write(form.user_data.data)
        input_file.close()
        os.system("echo 0x3f &gt; /proc/self/coredump_filter &amp;&amp; python3.8 %s/cryptor.py %s/flag.png &lt; input" % (curr_dir, curr_dir))
        os.system("rm input")
        files = filter(lambda x: os.path.isfile(x), os.listdir('.'))
        lst = [f"{foldername}/{x}" for x in files]        

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        os.chdir(root_dir)
        foldername = "Error!"
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    os.chdir(root_dir)
    for i in lst:
        data_file = open(i, "rb")
        data = data_file.read()
        data_file.close()
        data_file = open(i, "wb")
        cipher = ARC4.new(app.config['RC4_KEY'])
        data = cipher.encrypt(data)
        data_file.write(data)
        data_file.close()
    return render_template('files.html', title='Link', fn = lst)


from flask import send_from_directory

@app.route('/data/&lt;path:filename&gt;')
def serve_static(filename):
    
    return send_file(os.path.join(root_dir,"data", filename))
</code></pre>

<p>The flask component has two important functionalities.</p>

<p>One, it takes the post data sent by the user, writes it to a file, and pipes it to <code>cryptor.py</code> through stdin.</p>

<p>Two, it performs a RC4 operation on all the resultant files produced by <code>cryptor.py</code> and serves them back to the user. One thing to note is that a new RC4 object is constructed for each file and the same key is used. We will come back to this point later.</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at <code>cryptor.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import os
import random
import ast

class RC4:
    def __init__(self, key):
        S = list(range(0x100))
        j = 0
        for i in range(0x100):
            j = (S[i] + key[i % len(key)] + j) &amp; 0xff
            S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
        self.S = S
        self.keystream = self._keystream_generator()

    def crypt_file(self, data):
        res = []
        while (i := data.read(1)):
            res.append(ord(i) ^ next(self.keystream))
        return bytes(res)

    def crypt_string(self, data):
        res = []
        for i in data:
            res.append(ord(i) ^ next(self.keystream))
        return bytes(res)

    def _keystream_generator(self):
        x = y = 0
        while True:
            x = (x + 1) &amp; 0xff
            y = (self.S[x] + y) &amp; 0xff
            self.S[x], self.S[y] = self.S[y], self.S[x]
            i = (self.S[x] + self.S[y]) &amp; 0xff
            yield self.S[i]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    rc4_key = os.urandom(1024)
    cipher = RC4(rc4_key)
    del rc4_key
    data = open(sys.argv[1], "rb")
    res = cipher.crypt_file(data)
    f = open("res2.bin", "wb")
    f.write(res)
    f.close()
    del data
    K1 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K2 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K3 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K4 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K5 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    K6 = [random.randrange(0, 256, 1) for i in range(256)] 
    user_input = input()
    enc_dict = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
    to_encrypt = enc_dict['to_enc']
    if enc_dict['need_enc'] == 1:
        output = open("user.enc", "wb")
        encrypted = cipher.crypt_string(to_encrypt)
        output.write(output)
        output.close()
    else:
        output = open("user.enc", "wb")
        output.write(to_encrypt)
        output.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This part also does two things.</p>

<p>One, it encrypts the flag using rc4 with 1024 bytes of randomness as key in contrast to the fixed key used in the flask component.</p>

<p>Two, it takes the user input, parses it into a dictionary using <code>ast.literal_eval</code>, and either writes it directly to disk or encrypts it with rc4 then writes to disk based on a flag.</p>



<p>The challenge code and the hint in the description clearly suggest us to obtain a coredump of the python process. So, we need to figure out a way to crash python by manipulating the input to <code>ast.literal_eval</code>.</p>

<p>A quick google search later, we found exactly <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54763776/6711781">that</a>. As it turns out, the input <code>'()' * 1000000</code> causes the python parsing logic to go into multiple layers of recursion and will eventually lead to a crash.</p>

<pre><code>import requests

s = requests.Session()

# core dump
print s.post('http://crcrcr-cybrics2020.ctf.su/get_files',data={
  'user_data': '()' * 1000000,
  'submit': 'Get my files'
}).text
</code></pre>

<p>Part of the output that we care about:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a href=data/upload/cfae2f668f31fb0e4f6705f505c33e339a4f68f1/core&gt;core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a href=data/upload/cfae2f668f31fb0e4f6705f505c33e339a4f68f1/res2.bin&gt;res2.bin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>coredump and the encrypted data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we have a coredump, time for reversing right?</p>

<p>Not so fast, remember from before both files are encrypted by the flask component. This in fact makes <code>res2.bin</code> doubly encrypted. So we need a way of defeating this first layer of encryption</p>



<p>Time to brush up on the basics of rc4 encryption. The process is quite simple. The key helps the algorithm initialize its internal state. Then the algorithm can start producing an infinitely long key stream. The encryption process would just be to xor this newly produced key stream with our input.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it is not hard to see why reusing the same key for multiple encryptions is a bad idea. The same key always leads to the same key stream. So if we encrypt an unknown file A with the key stream K to produce B and then encrypt a known file C with the same key stream K to produce D, we get the property below:</p>

<pre><code>C, B, and D are known
trying to find A

# encrypt
B = xor(A, K)
D = xor(C, K)

# decrypt
K = xor(D, C)
A = xor(K, B)
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, we can recover the full key stream by encrypting a known file, and with the key stream in hand, we can recover all other files encrypted by the same key.</p>

<p>This is precisely the scenario we have on hand. By turning off encryption on user input, <code>cryptor.py</code> allows us to write anything we want to disk and that will later be encrypted using rc4 by the flask component.</p>

<pre><code>import requests
import urllib
s = requests.Session()

additional_headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}

# 75698176 is the size of the core dump

post_data ={
  'user_data': '{"need_enc":0, "to_enc":b"'+('a'*75698176)+'"}',
  'submit': 'Get my files'
}

print s.post('http://crcrcr-cybrics2020.ctf.su/get_files',data=urllib.urlencode(post_data), headers=additional_headers).text
</code></pre>

<p>Part of the output that we care about:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;a href=data/upload/4861eb51e2c18861f5111b63c92cd809b924eea1/user.enc&gt;user.enc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this new <code>user.enc</code> file, we can xor it with its original content to recover the full key stream and decrypt the other files:</p>

<pre><code>from pwn import *

with open('./dumps/core', 'rb') as f:
  enc_core = f.read()
with open('./dumps/res2.bin', 'rb') as f:
  enc_bin = f.read()
with open('./dumps/user.enc', 'rb') as f:
  enc_user = f.read()

key_stream = xor(enc_user, 'a'*len(enc_user))

assert len(key_stream) &gt;= len(enc_core)
plain_core = xor(key_stream, enc_core)
with open('./dumps/plain_core','wb') as f:
  f.write(plain_core)

plain_bin = xor(key_stream[:len(enc_bin)], enc_bin)
with open('./dumps/plain_bin','wb') as f:
  f.write(plain_bin)
</code></pre>



<p>Now is finally time for some reversing. We need to extract <code>cipher.S</code> (rc4 state) from the coredump. The best way to approach this would be to look at some cpython source code and find out how the state would look like in memory.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct _object {
    _PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    struct _typeobject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
</code></pre>

<p>They say sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I think about that every time I hear about another protest against a speaker or an idea.  If you really want to kill stupid ideas, you should actually let people discuss them publicly.  Otherwise, they get pushed to the far corners of the internet filled with other nutjobs*  There they get sympathy, not just for their idea, but for the fact that they were not allowed to speak publicly about it.</p>



<p>If someone wants to give a controversial talk, like to say that women are less intelligent than men, or that the Holocaust never happened, or that one race is genetically inferior to the other races, the best way to marginalize those ideas and highlight how stupid they are is to let them speak.  Don’t even waste time on protesting the speaker.  Don’t cancel them.  Shrug and say it’s not even worth your time to fight, or, if you do want to fight, go listen to the talk and write a summary online about how idiotic the talk was.</p>



<p>The way to defeat ideas you don’t like is to make them compete in the public domain of ideas, not to censor them.  When you censor them, you think you are squashing them out, but you are just giving them protected time and space to grow and find more supporters.</p>



<p>*<em>if you are reading this at some point in the future, it is quite possible that the term “nutjob” is politically incorrect for some reason, but as of the date I am writing this it is within the bounds of things you can say, so please don’t crucify me in 2035 for writing this in 2020.</em> </p>

<p>The number of ways you can setup a website/blog such as this can be overwhelming these days. In this post, I will talk about my requirements from my setup and an overview of how I solved them.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements<a href="#requirements">#</a></h2>
<p>I always wanted a small space for myself on the internet and I tried Blogger, WordPress and Twitter at various times to get there. (In fact, I <a href="https://ketanvijayvargiya.com/21-why-choose-wordpress-over-blogger/">once wrote</a> about how I preferred WordPress to Blogger and would stick with it <em>for long</em>!) Following are some of the factors that are important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Longevity</strong>: I’ve changed blog URLs so many times that I don’t want to do it again. I now want something for the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>Platorm lock-in</strong>: I want to avoid platform lock-in at all costs. And when any part of my system stopped working, I want the ability to switch to something else. A lot of platforms promise they don’t lock you in but the reality is more nuanced. For e.g., when I exported data from my older blog to move to the new setup, WordPress gave me a giant XML file. Sure, I have my data, but what do I do with it? I had to use some Python script on GitHub to create (half-baked) Markdown files out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Why can’t you just buy a custom domain on WordPress (or something) and call it a day? Well, all blogging websites come with either restrictions on their free tiers - for e.g., media storage limits, inability to opt out of ads that they control or paywalls for your readers - or recurring monthly or yearly subscriptions. While I understand their need to monetize, I am fairly technical myself and wanted to see how I can setup something the way I like without spending a lot of money.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domain">Custom domain<a href="#custom-domain">#</a></h2>
<p>In the past, I’ve tried <em>clever</em> names such as Thought Graffiti, Flag Unfurled (from High Hopes by Pink Floyd) etc. but such names stop being clever after awhile. This time, as you can see, I went with a boring domain name, one that contains my 1.5 mile long last name.</p>
<p>I bought it from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> because they were the cheapest at $8.88 per year. I also realized that such domain registration websites usually charge less for the first year but higher for renewals. Since I wanted something for a long time, I paid for 10 years upfront to save money.</p>
<p>Security is important on a website from where you purchase your domain name, so don’t forget to setup 2-factor authentication on your account.</p>
<p>An alternative to buying a custom domain is to use the free one that Netlify gave me: <a href="https://ketanvijayvargiya.netlify.app/">https://ketanvijayvargiya.netlify.app</a>. (See below for more on Netlify.) However, I didn’t want to be locked into Netlify.</p>
<h2 id="website-creation">Website creation<a href="#website-creation">#</a></h2>
<p>I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> for writing content because it is simple, yet powerful. Therefore, I went with a static site generator because it allows me to manage content in Markdown and takes care of converting the content into HTML and CSS. The resultant website is also simple that doesn’t contain any server-side components.</p>
<p>As expected, there are numerous SSGs out there.</p>
<p><strong>Gatsby</strong>: I first spent a few days with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>. Since my recent-most experience with web technologies is more than 7 years old - back when I dabbled with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and vanilla JavaScript in <a href="https://www.snapdeal.com/">Snapdeal</a> - I thought Gatsby, a React-based framework, would give me an opportunity to learn about modern tech.</p>
<p>I eventually gave up on Gatsby primarily because of the way its themes work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gatsby themes are somewhat coupled with website content. For e.g., each theme can have different assumptions about how the content is organized. So, if you wanted to change your theme in future, be prepared to re-do some of your current customizations.</li>
<li>If the theme you use gets updated upstream, for e.g., if the theme maintainers add a new feature, Gatsby doesn’t provide a good way for you to pull in those changes.</li>
<li>Gatsby themes are bloated. For e.g., look at the huge number of dependencies of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/">gatsby-starter-lumen</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/panr/gatsby-starter-hello-friend/">gatsby-starter-hello-friend</a>, the two themes I liked the most. (Ironically, the former is supposed to be <em>minimal</em>.) Moreover, when built locally, <em>npm</em> calls out a bunch of these dependencies as deprecated and I have no idea how to fix those warnings or what are its security implications.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I didn’t know at the time, Gatsby is painfully slow. I only realized that when I moved to Hugo after using Gatsby for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Jekyll</strong>: I immediately discarded <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> because I didn’t want to deal with Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo</strong>: I finally went with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which solved all the problems I mentioned earlier. Its approach to content management is uniform across themes and decoupled from them, so I can update themes independently.</p>
<h2 id="code-repository">Code repository<a href="#code-repository">#</a></h2>
<p>I preferred GitLab to GitHub as my <a href="https://gitlab.com/ketan-vijayvargiya/personal-website">code repository</a> because it offers more storage per repository (10 GB vs 1 GB). I wanted higher storage because I plan on storing static assets, such as images, in the same repository.</p>
<p>I also realize that Git isn’t a great choice for static content, so I setup Git LFS on GitLab to hold that.</p>
<h2 id="website-hosting">Website hosting<a href="#website-hosting">#</a></h2>
<p>I choose <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host my website. It is reliable and its free tier will be more than sufficient for me.</p>
<p>Some of its best features are the following: 100 GB/month bandwidth (which is a lot for a website that hardly anyone will visit!), 300 minutes/month build time (again, a lot for a Hugo website) and automated build+deploy the moment I do a <code>git push</code> on my computer. On security front, enabling HTTPS was straightforward and Netlify will take care of certificate renewal for me. And all these features are available on the free tier!</p>
<p>On the flip side, while I can enable analytics for $9 a month, I wish Netlify included a basic version of that in the free tier. Nothing fancy, just a daily counter of visits would suffice.</p>
<p>Side note: I changed the DNS nameservers for my domain to point from Namecheap to Netlify.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email<a href="#email">#</a></h2>
<p>I setup email on my domain through Zoho’s <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html">Forever Free plan</a> which gave me 5 GB storage (again, enough for me). The initial setup was cumbersome, with a lot of manual configurations, but that wasn’t because of Zoho. That’s just how emails on custom domains work. If you mess up, you could face issues while sending or receiving emails or your emails could land in your recipient’s spam folder. So, be careful!</p>
<p>I setup a catch-all rule on Zoho, so that any emails sent to <em>&lt;WHATEVER&gt;@ketanvijayvargiya.com</em> land in my one inbox. That allows me to create email addresses on the fly, so I have an infinite number of them.</p>
<p>An alternative to Zoho was a (free) email forwarding service such as <a href="https://improvmx.com/">ImprovMX</a> with my GMail or ProtonMail account underneath. However, Zoho seemed simpler.</p>
<p>Side note: Don’t forget to setup 2-factor authentication on your email account.</p>
<h2 id="other-optional-enhancements">Other (optional) enhancements<a href="#other-optional-enhancements">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Medium</strong>: While I won’t write on Medium so as to avoid platform lock-in, I will occasionally use their <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post">import feature</a> to mirror my posts there. This will allow me to reach more people while still maintaining full ownership of the content.</p>
<p><strong>Forestry</strong>: I imported my website into <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> today so that I can manage content through their web interface. I don’t fully know if I need it though, since I will be the sole contributor. I guess I’ll find out in sometime. (Note: an open-source alternative to Forestry is <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>As you can see above, the entire setup is free except for the custom domain. And even that is pretty cheap.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>For those who are new to the shell, we've covered a lot. In this chapter we'll slow down the pace of new commands a bit and instead focus on a core skill which you will already be familiar with from Graphical User Interfaces - using the clipboard.</p><p>You have probably already been using the clipboard with the shell, copying and pasting commands and their outputs. However, there's a lot more we can do with the clipboard. Now we'll look at how to take this to the next level.</p><p>We'll also briefly introduce introduce <em>aliases</em> and <em>pipelines</em>, which will be covered in a lot more detail in later chapters.</p><h2 id="the-clipboard-essentials">The Clipboard Essentials</h2><p>I wouldn't be surprised if the keyboard shortcuts to access the clipboard are already firmly locked into muscle memory for almost all readers, but just in case, here's a reminder of the shortcuts across different systems:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Windows Shortcut</th><th>Linux Shortcut</th><th>MacOS Shortcut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cut</td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>X</code></td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>X</code></td><td><code>⌘</code> + <code>X</code></td></tr><tr><td>Copy</td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code></td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code></td><td><code>⌘</code> + <code>C</code></td></tr><tr><td>Paste</td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code></td><td><code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code></td><td><code>⌘</code> + <code>V</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the shell, you may find that these commands don't run as expected. For example, in the screenshot below I have tried to use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> a few times to paste into terminal on Ubuntu:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/ctrl-v-on-ubuntu.png" alt="Screenshot: Ctrl + V on Ubuntu"></p><p>Instead of the contents of the clipboard being dropped into the shell, we see the text <code>^V</code>. Why is this?</p><p>Well, some of this is historical (the shell has been around for a long time so we'll see this answer a lot!). The reason the <code>Ctrl</code> key is <em>called</em> the <em>Control Key</em> is that it is used to send <em>control sequences</em> to the computer. When we're using the Control Key, the characters we send are not plain text, they're used to perform actions. This is something that is probably pretty familiar. For example, <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>P</code> is almost universally used as a shortcut for the ‘Print’ command.</p><p>We tend to think of these commands as <em>shortcuts</em> to save us from finding the appropriate command in a menu or on a toolbar. But of course most shells and command-line interfaces pre-date graphical user interfaces. They needed a way to differentiate between a user entering plain old text, and a user wanting to execute a certain command.</p><p>Even modern shells tend to follow the conventions around control sequences which were established by earlier ones to ensure a consistent experience for users who are used to working with shells. Shells have a whole bunch of control sequences which actually pre-date the graphical user interface, the clipboard itself, and even screens!</p><p>Some of the control sequences used in the shell you might already be familiar with. For example, if you have a program running and want to cancel it, you might be used to using <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code>. This actually sends a <em>signal</em> to the program and typically the program responds by closing. We'll see signals again and again as we go through the book.</p><p>The <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> combination terminates the current program. What about <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code>? This is the grand-sounding “<em>Verbatim Insert</em>” command. It tells the shell to write out the <em>next</em> keystroke you give it. This allows you to write out ‘special’ characters like the escape key, left or right keys, or even the <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> combination itself.</p><p>So if you type <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> twice, the shell writes out the text <code>^V</code>. The hat symbol <code>^</code> represents <code>Ctrl</code>. The first command tells the shell to write out the following command, the second is then written out directly. You can try writing out some different sequences. You'll see various odd looking symbols drawn, which represent things like the <code>Alt</code> key and other special keys.</p><p>So why do we need to care? Well the shell already has a command for <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> and <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code>, so we're going to need to work around this to use our familiar ‘copy’ and ‘paste’ commands.</p><p>How this works varies across platforms. Follow the instructions below for the platform you are using.</p><p><strong>Windows</strong></p><p>If you are using a <em>Command Prompt</em>, then the usual shortcuts will work fine. However, most of the time we will be using Bash. In this case the shortcuts will <em>not</em> work. Instead, select the <em>Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste</em> option from the properties menu:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste on Bash on Windows" src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/windows-bash-options.png" width="380px"></p><p>You can now use <code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code> for copy and <code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> for paste. You can also copy text by just dragging the cursor over it with the right mouse button.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong></p><p>On most Linux systems you'll be using the Gnome terminal, which means that you can use <code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code> for copy and <code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> for paste. You can also right click on text with the cursor to select it.</p><p><strong>MacOS</strong></p><p>Mac users can just use <code>⌘ + C</code> for copy and <code>⌘ + V</code> for paste. The shell doesn't use the special Mac Command character <code>⌘</code>, which means the default keyboard mappings on MacOS work fine in a shell as they do not clash with anything.</p><p>Now that we've got the basics out of the way, and learnt far more than we probably wanted to about control keys, we can look at more ways to use the clipboard.</p><h2 id="preparing-the-clipboard-commands">Preparing the Clipboard Commands</h2><p>Copying and pasting text to and from the clipboard is useful, but there's a lot more we can do. With a couple of basic commands we can hugely expand what we can do with the shell and make a whole set of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish.</p><p>There is one small complexity we'll need to work through before we continue. The complexity is that the clipboard is accessed in different ways on Windows, Linux and MacOS. I'll first show you how to deal with this, just follow the instructions for the platform you are working on.</p><p>To make things easier for the reader I'm going to assume you have created the <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> commands by following the instructions below. I am creating these commands so that regardless of the platform you are using the tutorials will work in the same way!</p><p><strong>Windows</strong></p><p>Assuming you are using WSL, you will need to run the following two commands. By the time this book is published there <em>may</em> be a cleaner way, but for now this is a workaround for some limitations on the WSL system:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">alias pbcopy<span>=</span><span>"clip.exe"</span>
alias pbpaste<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>powershell.exe -command 'Get-Clipboard' | sed -e 's/\r\n</span>$<span>//g'</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Don't worry about how these commands work - by the time you've gone through the book it should make perfect sense. For now you just need to know we're adding two new commands to our toolkit - <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code>, which will work in Bash on Windows.</p><p><strong>Linux</strong></p><p>Hopefully if you are Linux user the commands below will seem familiar. They install the <code>xclip</code> program and create shortcuts to copy and paste. You absolutely don't need to do this if you prefer to call <code>xclip</code> directly, these commands are just setup so that across all platforms the tutorial looks the same.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">sudo apt install -y xclip
alias pbcopy<span>=</span><span>"xclip -selection c"</span>
alias pbpaste<span>=</span><span>"xclip -selection c -o"</span>
</code></pre></div><p><strong>MacOS</strong></p><p>Nothing is required on MacOS - <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> are built in.</p><p><strong>Making these changes permanent</strong></p><p>We've used the <code>alias</code> command to create <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code>. In Bash (and most shells) an <code>alias</code> is something you can configure as a shortcut to avoid having to type longer commands. There's a whole chapter on commands in Section 2.</p><p>These instructions will need to be repeated when you re-open your terminal. In a later chapter we'll see how to make permanent customisations to our shells so that we don't have to repeat this setup.</p><p>We'll also see later on how to create configuration which works across many different platforms, so that you can use the same configuration regardless of what platform you are working on. This is very useful if you work across multiple machines or operating systems!</p><h2 id="copy-and-paste-basics">Copy and Paste Basics</h2><p>Now that we've created these commands, we can use them to access the clipboard. For example, if I copy the following text:</p><pre><code>Kirk Van Houten
Timothy Lovejoy
Artie Ziff
</code></pre><p>Then I can paste it into the shell with the following command:</p><p>And we'll see something like this:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/pbpaste.png" alt="Screenshot: pbpaste in action"></p><p>Copying is just as straightforward. If you have downloaded the Effective Shell ‘playground’ folder you can see we have a list of characters from “The Simpsons” in the file <code>playground/text/simpsons-characters.txt</code>. Now we <em>could</em> use the <code>cat</code> command to show the contents of the file, and then manually select the text and copy it. Even easier though is to just <em>pipe</em> the contents of the file to the <code>pbcopy</code> command:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cat ~/playground/text/simpsons-characters.txt | pbcopy
</code></pre></div><p>The output will look similar to the below (I've included the output of <code>cat</code> for reference as well):</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/pbcopy.png" alt="Screenshot: pbcopy in action"></p><p>The vertical bar <code>|</code> is the <em>pipe</em> operator. It tells the shell to take the output from the command on the left and send it straight to the <em>input</em> of the program on the right. We're going to see a <em>lot</em> more of the pipeline operator as we continue. For now it's enough to know you can use it to ‘chain’ commands together.</p><p>This might not seem super useful so far - but if the text file was a lot larger then it would be much harder to <code>cat</code> it out, use the mouse to select all of the text (scrolling up through the window) and then copy it. And if you didn't have a mouse, it would be even more tricky. We're aiming to be as effective as possible when using the shell so being able to use the keyboard quickly for common tasks is critical.</p><p>Now we can see some real world examples of how these commands can be useful in daily tasks!</p><h2 id="removing-formatting">Removing Formatting</h2><p>Don't you hate it when you have to copy formatted text and don't have an easy way to paste it as <em>unformatted</em> text? Here's an example, I want to copy this Wikipedia page on ‘bash’, and paste it into a Word document:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/strip-formatting-before.png" alt="Copying and pasting with formatting"></p><p>Many programs have a shortcut to paste the contents of the clipboard (such as ‘command + shift + v’) but if you are like me you might find yourself pasting <em>into</em> a plain text editor just to copy <em>out</em> the plain text.</p><p>If you just run the command <code>pbpaste | pbcopy</code>, you can easily strip the formatting:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/4-clipboard-gymnastics/images/strip-formatting-after.png" alt="Stripping formatting from the clipboard"></p><p>We're just piping out the clipboard (which ends up as plain text, cause we're in a terminal!) and then piping that plain text <em>back into the clipboard</em>, replacing the formatted text which was there before.</p><p>This little trick can be very useful. But we can use the same pattern to quickly manipulate the contents of the clipboard in more sophisticated ways.</p><h2 id="sorting-text">Sorting Text</h2><p>Because we can <em>pipe</em> the contents of the clipboard to other programs, that means we can easily use the huge number of tools available …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"
       artifacts: true
     End: true</code></pre>



<ul><li><strong><em>Pipeline</em></strong><em> — </em>is the root key which defines the start of the pipeline section</li><li><strong><em>StartAt</em></strong><em> — </em>defines the first action of the pipeline</li><li><strong><em>States</em></strong><em> — </em>defines a list of states for the particular pipeline</li><li><strong><em>Type</em></strong><em> — a </em>type of pipeline action. Always set it to <em>Task</em>.</li><li>Resource — an action that the engine will use. Currently, we support <em>microtica.actions.cmd</em>, an action that executes bash scripting.</li><li>Parameters — a set of parameters that are given to the action<ul><li><strong><em>commands</em></strong><em> — </em>a list of bash commands. Here, you define your custom scripts for build, test, code quality checks, etc.</li><li><strong><em>sourceLocation</em></strong> — the location where the action can find the source code. You should NOT change this. Once pulled from the Git repository, Microtica stores the artifacts on a location specified by the user for the particular component/microservice. <em>$.trigger.source.location</em> defines that location.</li><li><strong><em>artifacts</em></strong> — a value that defines that this build will produce artifacts which will be stored in S3 and used during deployment. Set this value should to <em>false</em> in case the artifact of the build is Docker image</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>End</em></strong><em> — </em>defines that this is the last action in the pipeline.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

What if you could debug type errors with a simple compile time print statement? Write highly flexible systems by being able to introspect into types at compile time? Pre-calculate large portions of your programs for great efficiency? Typed functional programming is a great and fun way to write resilient software, and as type systems have become more and more expressive in recent years, we are able to program sophisticated and useful properties at the type level for even better compile time safety. Just one problem: It is very difficult, requires advanced knowledge of the type system, the syntax is convoluted, the error messages are impenetrable, and it is nearly impossible to debug. This talk will dive into why we should steal static introspection from languages like Nim, and D, state-of-the-art imperative programming languages which can solve all these issues, make type systems much more approachable without losing any expressive power, and offer new design possibilities for functional programs.</em></p><p id="bf8b"><em>Join us on Zoom: </em><a href="https://zoom.us/j/95139644343" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://zoom.us/j/95139644343</em></a></p><p id="f699"><em>Join us on YouTube: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI</em></a></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="31bb"><em>Many things are being said about Deep Reinforcement Learning, but sometimes it is really hard to know where to start.

We will showcase how this feature is not only what makes standard Julia code as fast as C or Fortran, but also allows Julia to eschew the traditional idea of â€œmachine learning frameworksâ€� and instead have machine learning directly work on the standard functions and libraries of the whole Julia programming language.

        <p>Mom would be ashamed of you if you wrote a function like</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>const</span> nameOfLandlordsDog <span>=</span> person <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  <span>const</span> landlord <span>=</span> <span>person</span>.<span>landlord</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>landlord) <span>return</span> <span>null</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>  <span>const</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>landlord</span>.<span>dog</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>dog) <span>return</span> <span>null</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>dog</span>.<span>name</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For one thing, it’s Javascript. The neighbors might begin to talk if they found out about your double life as a Javascript enthusiast. What’s more, there’s too much <em>plumbing</em> in this function, too much <code>if (blah) return null</code>. Wouldn’t it be much better if you wrote something like</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>const</span> nameOfLandlordsDog <span>=</span> person <span>=&gt;</span> person<span>?</span>.<span>landlord</span><span>?</span>.<span>dog</span><span>?</span>.<span>name</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>?.</code> optional chaining operator is still technically “plumbing”. But the business logic here is much more apparent; moreover, this is significantly less Javascript, maybe even little enough to quell the growing rumors of your Javascriptian proclivities.</p>
<p>You don’t really want to write this, either:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>const</span> bookMeeting <span>=</span> (participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details<span>,</span> callback) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>room</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(details<span>,</span> (err) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>    <span>if</span> (err) <span>return</span> <span>callback</span>(err)</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>async</span>.<span>map</span>(participants<span>,</span> (participant<span>,</span> callback) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a>      <span>participant</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(room<span>,</span> details<span>,</span> callback)</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a>    <span>},</span> (err) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a>      <span>if</span> (err) <span>return</span> <span>callback</span>(err)</span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>async</span>.<span>map</span>(participants<span>,</span> (participant<span>,</span> callback) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a>        <span>sendEmail</span>(<span>participant</span>.<span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>meetingEmail</span>(details)<span>,</span> callback)</span>
<span id="cb3-10"><a href="#cb3-10"></a>      <span>},</span> callback)</span>
<span id="cb3-11"><a href="#cb3-11"></a>    <span>}</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-12"><a href="#cb3-12"></a>  <span>}</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This, too, is rife with plumbing. A <code>callback</code> parameter in every function call? An <code>if (err) return callback(err)</code> in every corner? Revolting! Do you kiss your mother with that Javascript?</p>
<p>It would be far more pleasant if you wrote:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>const</span> bookMeeting <span>=</span> <span>async</span> (participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  <span>await</span> <span>room</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(details)</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  <span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.<span>all</span>(<span>participants</span>.<span>map</span>(participant <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>    <span>participant</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(details)</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>  ))</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a>  <span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.<span>all</span>(<span>participants</span>.<span>map</span>(participant <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a>    <span>sendEmail</span>(<span>participant</span>.<span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>meetingEmail</span>(details))</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a>  ))</span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, “await” is plumbing, but much more succinct plumbing. Mom will forgive you, this once.</p>
<p>She is, however, a real stickler for transactionality. I wouldn’t be surprised if she asked you for a version of <code>bookMeeting</code> that rolls back if an operation is not successful.</p>
<p>Here what you <strong>don’t</strong> want to write:</p>

<p>It’s a monstrosity! It is littered with <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code>. That <code>for</code> loop is obscene! Show that to Mom, and she’ll have a lawyer over by lunch time to draw up her will, just so she can write you out of it.</p>
<p>You’re better off with something like:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>const</span> bookMeeting <span>=</span> (transaction<span>,</span> participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>  <span>room</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(transaction<span>,</span> details)</span>

<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>    <span>participant</span>.<span>calendar</span>.<span>addMeeting</span>(transaction<span>,</span> details)</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>  )</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>  <span>participants</span>.<span>map</span>(participant <span>=&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a>    <span>sendEmail</span>(transaction<span>,</span> <span>participant</span>.<span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>meetingEmail</span>(details)</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a>  )</span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a>  <span>return</span> transaction</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a><span>// And then the caller can do e.g.</span></span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a><span>const</span> tx <span>=</span> <span>newTransaction</span>()</span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14"></a><span>bookMeeting</span>(tx<span>,</span> participants<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> details)</span>
<span id="cb6-15"><a href="#cb6-15"></a><span>await</span> <span>tx</span>.<span>run</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You have to implement the right <code>newTransaction</code> and the right <code>.run</code>, and lug this magical “transaction” object around, and implement <code>addMeeting</code> and <code>runMeeting</code> to interact with the transaction correctly, but in the end it’s worth it, the plumbing is much reduced. Explicit praise from Mom might be too much to hope for, but perhaps a half-smile, laced with the merest hint of approval? That could go a long way.</p>
<p>If we’re really going to lock in that half-smile, though, we’re going to have to do more.</p>
<p>We addressed one type of plumbing with <code>?.</code>, another type of plumbing with <code>async/await</code>, and another type of plumbing with a handcrafted <code>transaction</code> object. What if there were some single abstraction that captured this idea of “plumbing” more generally? Wouldn’t it be incredible?</p>
<p>Good news! It is incredible – and the antecedent of “it”, as you may have guessed, is “Monads.”</p>
<p>What are monads, exactly? Don’t worry about that, for now. That’s kind of like asking “what is TCP, exactly?” You can use TCP to reliably send messages over a network, and that’s really all you need to know to get started. Sure, one fine morning you’ll wake up to servers crashing down around your ears for reasons involving something called <code>TIME_WAIT</code>, and on that day you’ll begin to tackle the remainder of what there is to know about TCP, but the inevitability of that day shouldn’t prevent you from living a happy, carefree life in the meanwhile. Similarly, all you need to know about monads to get started – as far as I am concerned, anyway – is that you can use them to define the “plumbing” inside your code separately from defining those sequences of operations that your “plumbing” connects. Where “plumbing” can be anything from “short-circuit when an operation returns a null”, or “short-circuit when an operation returns an error”, or “short-circuit when an operation returns an error and roll back all the previous operations”, or even “when an operation returns multiple results, feed each of those results separately into the next operation”</p>
<p>So let’s recap all the examples in this blog post, but do it in Haskell, which has good support for monads. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with Haskell – the point isn’t that you will follow and understand every statement, but that you can see the “before” and “after” of Monads removing the “plumbing” from the implementations.</p>
<p>Here is <code>nameOfLandlordsDog</code> again, without monads, but in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>nameOfLandlordsDog ::</span> <span>Person</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>nameOfLandlordsDog person <span>=</span> </span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>case</span> landlordOf person <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>    <span>Just</span> landlord <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> dogOf landlord <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>      <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>      <span>Just</span> dog <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> nameOf dog <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a>        <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>        <span>Just</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> name</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even more plumbing-ridden than <code>if (!blah) return null</code>, right? Luckily, because <code>Maybe</code> is a monad, you can instead write:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>nameOfLandlordsDog person <span>=</span> nameOf <span>=&lt;&lt;</span> dogOf <span>=&lt;&lt;</span> landlordOf person</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Where <code>=&lt;&lt;</code> is like Javascript’s <code>?.</code>. It is the (reverse) monadic “bind” operator that combines operations together, according to the particular “plumbing” of the monad they are in. For the <code>Maybe</code> monad, the plumbing behavior is “short circuit on Nothing”.</p>
<p>Using <code>=&lt;&lt;</code> (or its twin <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) is a good way to succinctly string together simple sequences of operations that return <code>Maybe</code> or other monads. But Haskell has a special notation called “do notation” that is often more readable when you have to combine the results of operations in a more complicated way than simple sequencing. So here is <code>nameOfLandlordsDog</code> with do notation:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>nameOfLandlordsDog ::</span> <span>Person</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>nameOfLandlordsDog person <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  landlord <span>&lt;-</span> landlordOf person</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a>  dog <span>&lt;-</span> dogOf landlord</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  nameOf dog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This isn’t as succinct as the <code>=&lt;&lt;</code> version, but it is still pretty cool. The equivalent in Javascript would be if there were this magical “plumbing” keyword that let you write e.g.:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>const</span> nameOfLandlordsDog <span>=</span> (person) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>  <span>plumbing</span> (shortcircuit_nulls) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>    <span>const</span> landlord <span>=</span> <span>person</span>.<span>landlord</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4"></a>    <span>const</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>landlord</span>.<span>dog</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>dog</span>.<span>name</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><a href="#cb10-6"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7"><a href="#cb10-7"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then you can just write your code so you just don’t have to worry about short-circuiting on nulls.</p>
<p>So now let’s move on to the next example: <code>bookMeeting</code>. Here it is in Haskell, written with callbacks (or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">“continuation-passing style”</a>, which is the fancy way to say “callbacks”). You wouldn’t write Haskell with callbacks in typical circumstances, but for the sake of the example here it is (<a href="https://repl.it/@twitchard/MomAndMonads#bookMeetingCallbacks.hs">full example</a>):</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>bookMeeting ::</span> [<span>Person</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Room</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Details</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Either</span> <span>String</span> () <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> r) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> r</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a>bookMeeting participants room details callback <span>=</span> </span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>  addMeeting details (calendarOf room) <span>$</span> \result <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> result <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a>    <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> callback (<span>Left</span> err)</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5"></a>    <span>Right</span> () <span>-&gt;</span> forEach participants </span>
<span id="cb11-6"><a href="#cb11-6"></a>      (\p <span>-&gt;</span> addMeeting details (calendarOf p)) <span>$</span> \results <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><a href="#cb11-7"></a>        <span>case</span> results <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb11-8"><a href="#cb11-8"></a>          <span>Left</span> err <span>-&gt;</span> callback (<span>Left</span> err)</span>
<span id="cb11-9"><a href="#cb11-9"></a>          <span>Right</span> _ <span>-&gt;</span> forEach participants (\p <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb11-10"><a href="#cb11-10"></a>            sendEmail details (emailOf p)) callback</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, the plumbing here is out of control. Mom is irate! If you’re going to write code like this, why don’t you just do in it Javascript, or dance on her grave?</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Haskell has a monad that captures “callbacks that short-circuit on error”. This monad is called <code>ExceptT Error (ContT r IO)</code>, and the reason it has such a confusing name is because it’s actually a combination of three monads: <code>Except String</code>, which is the monad that captures short-circuiting on errors (specifically, errors of type String), <code>Cont</code>, which is the monad that captures sequential execution of functions that accept callbacks, and <code>IO</code>, which is the monad that lets you do IO – access the network and the operating system and stuff.</p>
<p>So first, with a bit of boilerplate, we can wrap the callbacky <code>addMeeting</code> and <code>sendEmail</code> operations in this monad:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>addMeeting ::</span> <span>Details</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Calendar</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ExceptT</span> <span>String</span> (<span>ContT</span> r <span>IO</span>) ()</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>addMeeting details calendar <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>  <span>ExceptT</span> <span>.</span> <span>ContT</span> <span>.</span> Callbacks.addMeeting details <span>$</span> calendar</span>
<span id="cb12-4"><a href="#cb12-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-5"><a href="#cb12-5"></a><span>sendEmail ::</span> <span>Details</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Email</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ExceptT</span> <span>String</span> (<span>ContT</span> r <span>IO</span>) ()</span>
<span id="cb12-6"><a href="#cb12-6"></a>sendEmail details email <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb12-7"><a href="#cb12-7"></a>  <span>ExceptT</span> <span>.</span> <span>ContT</span> <span>.</span> Callbacks.sendEmail details <span>$</span> email</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then we can implement <code>bookMeeting</code> …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Our spunky little Honda Fit is now 13 years old, and although it has served us well, we have begun to outgrow it.</p>

<p>I started researching minivans, and one particular online-only auto seller seemed to have an attractive inventory.</p>

<p>So I decided to create an account with them and set up some filters and alerts.</p>

<p>But creating an account was harder than it appeared.</p>

<p>I entered my email address on their sign-up page.  The input field immediately turned red, and the page informed me that my email address was invalid.</p>

<p>I encounter this problem occasionally, because I use subaddressing in my email address.</p>

<p>A normal email address looks like this: <code>username@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When you use subaddressing, you tack on a little extra bit between your username and the @ sign: <code>username+subaddress@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When the site emails you, the subaddress gets ignored for the purpose of routing the message to you, 
   but it shows up in the "To" field of the email address.  That can be tremendously useful.  It allows
   you to set up filters to always allow or always deny messages that include a specific subaddress,
   and it can sometimes be used to determine whether a site has had a data breach or sold your contact
   information to spammers.</p>

<p>Although subaddressing is widely supported by email service providers, including Google's Gmail, it continues to trip up sites
   that perform email address validation using regular expressions, also known by the abbreviation regex.</p>
   
<p>Regex allows site developers to specify what a valid email address looks like.  
   It can determine whether an email address contains invalid characters, or whether it's missing an @ sign.</p>
   
<p>The problem is, valid email addresses come in many forms, and many regular expressions used to validate email addresses
   are not able to recognize the full range of valid formats.</p>
   
<p>In the case of the auto seller's form validation, I was able to inspect their Javascript code.
   The portion of the email validation regex that deals with the username (the part before the @ sign)
   looks like this:</p>
   
<p><code>^[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*</code></p>

<p>The key thing about this regex snippet is that the only characters that are considered valid are
   alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods.</p>
   
<p>If a plus sign is present, as when using subaddressing, it treats the email address as invalid, even though it is perfectly valid
   — and has been for years.</p>
   
<p>While it's frustrating that many sites continue to reject email addresses that use subaddressing, I have a Plan B.</p>

<p>I instead use a secondary email address without subaddressing, which is associated with <a href="https://newlywed.science/">newlywed.science</a>,
   a domain I use to promote my book <i>Experiments for Newlyweds</i>.</p>
   
<p>I entered that email address into the sign-up form, but again I was informed that it was invalid.</p>

<p>I took another look at the email validation regex and discovered an even stupider issue.</p>

<p>Here is the portion of their email validation regex that deals with the domain (the part after the @ sign):</p>
   
<p><code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})$</code></p>

<p>The relevant part of this snippet is at the very end.  It says that the top-level domain (TLD) must be between two and four letters long.</p>

<p>The most well-known TLDs, such as .com, .org, .net, .edu, and .gov, tend to have three letters.  
   Country-specific TLDs, such as .uk or .de, tend to have two letters.</p>
   
<p>But starting around the turn of the century, more and more new TLDs came into use.  
   For instance, .museum became active in June 2001, and .travel began accepting registrations in January 2006.</p>
   
<p>So TLDs that exceed four letters in length have been around for quite a while.</p>

<p>Yet anyone with an email address associated with such a TLD is locked out of creating an account with this auto seller because of this regex.</p>

<p>It's frustrating that major websites continue to rely on such shoddy email address validation, and this time I decided to make my frustration known.</p>

<p>I searched around for a contact email address on the site, but the best I could find was a Live Chat feature.</p>

<p>So, at 2 p.m. Eastern, I opened a Live Chat session and encouraged them to fix their terrible regex.</p>

<p>A robo-responder informed me that unfortunately, my message could not be handled, because Live Chat is only available between 8 a.m. and 8:45 p.m. Eastern.</p>

<p><em>Thet Lynn Han, known as Ricky Thet, is the 36-year-old founder and CEO of Bagan IT. The Myanmar-based development company has been operating since 2010, when Thet moved back to Myanmar from Singapore. Bagan’s products include a local-language keyboard, an e-bookstore, and a fortune-telling service.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Are we coders or phone fixers?</strong></h3>



<p>When my <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16546688">country began to change</a> in 2010, to open up, I knew I wanted to be part of building the new Myanmar. But, at that time, there was none of the basic infrastructure the rest of the world takes for granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My parents wanted me to be a doctor, but I loved computers. I couldn’t study computer science in Myanmar when I graduated from high school in 2000, so I left for Singapore to study and then stayed there to work.</p>



<p>During the ten years I was&nbsp;living in Singapore, I wanted to read books in Burmese, but back then, almost none of them were digitized. You had to have a hard copy. So when I came back,<strong> </strong>I<strong> </strong>wanted to put Burmese-language books online.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>In 2012, when we launched our first apps, very <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=MM">few people were online</a> in Myanmar, and data was very expensive. People would often turn off their data when they weren’t using it. That meant it was almost impossible to get user insights about what wasn’t working for users, and digital literacy was very low.</p>



<p>We began working with the mobile phone technicians at the local tuck shops where people buy and fix their phones. Often, when customers had issues with their phones or just didn’t know how to use certain features, they’d come back to the shops where they had purchased them and have the technicians help. We’d show these guys how to use our apps so they could answer a customer’s question about our products. If we were releasing something new, we’d let the technicians know, so they could tell their customers.</p>



<p>We had whole relationship teams who would travel around the country to meet with mobile shop owners, collect their insights, and show them how to use our latest applications.</p>



	




<h3><strong>One product at a time</strong></h3>



<p>Our first product was a Burmese-language keyboard. The most common Burmese font, Zawgyi, is not compatible with Unicode, the international standard for encoding fonts, and the background processing is based on the English language. This was especially an issue, because between 40% and 50% of the phones in Myanmar are Chinese phones made for the Chinese domestic market. All of these obstacles combined meant there were a lot of rendering issues and limitations for the Burmese font.</p>

		</figure>


<p>Google didn’t launch its Burmese-language keyboard in Myanmar until a few years ago, but we were here first. We could see what the Burmese people needed. Our keyboard currently has 10 million monthly active users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the Burmese keyboard, we tackled books. The publishers were suspicious of digitizing books at first, and it took years of building relationships with them to get the 10,000 books we have online now. Same thing with our fortune-telling app, Min Thein Kha, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200425-online-mystics-cash-in-during-myanmar-virus-lockdown">which has 50,000 daily active users</a>. Once the payments for the e-bookstore were running, it was a proof of concept we brought to the family of Min Thein Kha, the most famous Burmese fortune teller. They saw that the fortune tellers they worked with could get paid if they put their services on an app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the biggest challenge was payments. Less than 2% of people in Myanmar have<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/sg/Documents/consumer-business/sea-cb-myanmar-consumer-survey-2020.pdf"> access to a credit card</a>, and <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/countrybook/Myanmar.pdf">75% </a>are unbanked. We needed to find a different way to bill them.</p>



<p>The local telecom companies are the only entities that cover the whole population. We persuaded them to let us charge users for app-based purchases on their telephone bills, but we had to be very deliberate when designing to make it clear to people that that’s what they should expect. Even that was not a perfect solution; a credit card might charge you an extra 5% on top of your purchase. With the telecom companies, it could be anywhere from 45% to 60% in additional charges and fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to partner with the telecom companies for billing, we needed to be able to ensure a minimum guaranteed revenue, so it was, and still is, very important that everything we built be attractive to our users. And we needed to demonstrate that we had the capacity to handle all of the customer support.</p>



<h3><strong>Building everything yourself</strong></h3>



<p>In other countries, these kinds of payment and customer-service systems&nbsp;would already be set up. Things are changing quickly here in Myanmar — mobile money is becoming more popular — but even now, I’d say only 30% of our work is building the apps, whereas 70% is dealing with these kinds of infrastructure issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as things are progressing and more, and Burmese people are coming online and getting phones, we can call customers directly to get insights. We’re also getting some data using Facebook, but more than anything else, we rely on calling people for feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early years, we had an automatic refund policy —&nbsp;if someone said they were charged incorrectly, we’d give the money back, no questions asked. It’s an important way to build trust with people who are using apps like these for the first time. If we didn’t get it right, how would users ever trust something like mobile money?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw it as an investment in our users and in our future.</p>

			<p>APIs are everywhere within your organization. Many may be internal, but we’re willing to bet there are many third-party web services and APIs that your business depends on too. Keeping track of them all, and ensuring that your team chooses the best APIs for their needs can be a challenge. In some cases, your organization may be using an API they don’t even know about. The solution to this “web of APIs” is to apply the concept of API governance to your API dependencies.</p><h2 id="what-is-api-governance">What is API Governance?</h2><p>Before we go into applying the concept to third-party APIs, we should look at what API governance is.</p><p>API governance is a set of policies and procedures that act as <strong>guidelines for how your organization uses APIs</strong>. Governance is all about security and reliability. It can take many shapes, but it helps with things like:</p><ul><li>Establishing criteria for choosing APIs.</li><li>Defining any shared standards, like security, that APIs will share.</li><li>Aids in the discovery of existing APIs in the organization.</li><li>Laying out plans for usage, versioning, etc.</li></ul><p>This process makes a lot of sense when a good part of your stack is dedicated to providing APIs, but what about the external APIs that your organization consumes? Can you apply a similar approach to the APIs you depend on, even if you don’t have control over them?</p><h3 id="applying-the-idea-of-governance-to-third-party-apis">Applying the idea of governance to third-party APIs</h3><p>As your organization grows, there’s a high likelihood that every API consumed won’t be known. Development teams working on different products and services may have some overlap, but what are the chances of two teams signing up for the same API? What about choosing two differing APIs that serve the same purpose?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg" alt="Governance over APIs" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>For third party APIs, the governance process can lead to two key artifacts: an <strong>API catalog</strong> and a <strong>set of guidelines for choosing APIs</strong>. Let’s look at some API governance best practices, but applied to third-party API dependencies.</p><h2 id="api-catalogs">API Catalogs</h2><p>When we onboard new customers to Bearer, some often discover that their organization is using APIs they didn’t know about. This isn’t unique to giant organizations either. Even small teams can run into this problem. An API catalog can be a valuable way to centralize details about all the services and APIs that your organization uses. The format this catalog takes can change with the needs of your organization, but the benefits can directly affect your development teams as well as your business strategy. Let’s look at a few benefits, and things you may want to include in your own API catalog.</p><h3 id="increased-discoverability">Increased Discoverability</h3><p>By collecting details about each API, your team can create a centralized location for the whole organization. This allows teams to discover which SaaS providers you already have a relationship with, and which services are currently available. </p><p>This is also a great way to avoid duplication across teams, and avoids the selection of similar APIs that serve the same purpose.</p><h3 id="sla-tracking">SLA Tracking</h3><p>Service-level Agreements (SLA) are a contract between your organization and the API provider. It can often be hard to keep track of expectations at a high level. A central catalog of APIs offers a place for all SLA details to be stored.</p><p>You can take this a step further by incorporating monitoring to ensure that services are meeting their requirements, and even tie this directly into the catalog for at-a-glance oversight.</p><h3 id="centralized-test-coverage">Centralized Test Coverage</h3><p>While it may not be feasible or even possible to incorporate testing directly into an API catalog, it can be an excellent place to store coverage statistics. How are, or perhaps in the dark, are you about the last time tests were run on a particular API endpoint? Is it possible there is a rarely used API in your stack that has been down for a while, unbeknownst to your team? Bring the results into your API catalog.</p><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>Are you paying for service that you no longer use? By tracking API usage across an entire organization, you can examine areas such as:</p><ul><li>Which teams are currently using an API?</li><li>Is the organization on the most cost-effective plan?</li><li>Are there multiple, similar APIs in use when a single one could suffice?</li><li>On <em>pay-as-you-go</em> plans where you pay for each call, are you often over budget?</li></ul><h3 id="knowledge-base">Knowledge Base</h3><p>The centralized test coverage portion covers part of this benefit, but your API catalog can act as a central knowledge base for every API in your organization. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>Internal documentation related to an API (like a Postman collection).</li><li>Links to status pages, official documentation, and examples.</li><li>Locations of credentials.</li><li>Points of contact for API consumers in each department.</li></ul><p>You can use an existing solution to create the catalog, though the space is mostly filled with API management platforms designed around providing internal APIs to your teams. Alternately, you can build your own solution or add the functionality to a tool you already use. This catalog is essentially a content management system (CMS) that stores the necessary information about each API as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Make the process of registering APIs to the catalog easy—or even automatic—for developers, as it will increase the adoption of the centralized hub.</p><h2 id="defining-api-selection-guidelines">Defining API Selection Guidelines</h2><p>How does your organization select which APIs to implement? Does each team—or developer—make decisions on their own? Is there an approval process? Are there restrictions on what kinds of APIs makes it into production? What about SLA requirements?</p><p>These questions, and others like them, are the foundation for defining a set of API selection guidelines. In many cases, you will be starting from a point of existing API dependencies. This is a good time to assess the landscape. Poll your teams, collect the data, and organize it. While existing APIs can be excluded from a selection policy, it is good to at least compare them to the guidelines you set. Start by defining the criteria that new APIs will need to meet. These criteria can include:</p><ul><li>A minimum set of SLA requirements (uptime guarantees, time to response, etc.).</li><li>Deprecation timelines and versioning details.</li><li>Cost vs. Value: Are there alternatives at lower costs? Is it worth it to build instead of buy?</li><li>Cross-team impact: Will an API be useful to more than one part of the organization.</li><li>Support availability: Does the price come with reliable support, both for the development with and management of the API?</li><li>Stack compatibility: What stacks have SDKs, and what would it take to continue using the API if your stack changes?</li><li>Ease of use and depth of documentation.</li><li>Data policy: Whether handling GDPR compliance or HIPPA laws, an API’s data policy has a direct impact on your own data management.</li></ul><h2 id="enforcing-governance-and-adding-value-to-your-organization">Enforcing governance and adding value to your organization</h2><p>With a catalog set up, and guidelines in place, enforcement keeps the process going. It’s important to establish a set of processes that doesn’t limit your teams ability to experiment and work efficiently, but also protects your organization from the shadow APIs that suddenly appear in your stack. Make sure the approval cycle is low-friction and the monitoring of new and existing APIs makes it easy to track usage.</p><p>Governance is a way to bring structure to your organization’s dependence on APIs, but it shouldn’t be yet another piece of technical debt. The good news is you don’t need to dive all-in right away. Simply starting to monitor API usage and performance across the organization as a whole is an excellent first step. At <a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a>, part of our offering helps with this by automatically monitoring API calls and organizing them in a central dashboard. This is one way to quickly view which APIs you are using effectively and monitor them from a performance, SLA, and anomaly standpoint. Explore ways to tie governance into your existing processes. The catalog can even live in your team’s internal knowledge base.</p><p>Take the first step toward adding more observability and oversight to the APIs that your organization uses. Set up a policy and implement the appropriate tooling to control and enforce the policy. This will help build a culture around scrutinizing and monitoring API dependencies and improve the overall resilience of your applications.<br></p>

		<div>

			
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/issues/10">some of the statistics</a> we are going to study for this year’s Web Almanac we may end up needing a list of CSS shorthands and their longhands. Now this is typically done by <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">maintaining a data structure by hand</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/blob/gh-pages/prefixfree.js#L298">guessing based on property name structure</a>. But I knew that if we were going to do it by hand, it’s very easy to miss a few of the less popular ones, and the naming rule where shorthands are a prefix of their longhands <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0155.html">has failed to get standardized</a> and now has even more exceptions than it used to. And even if we do an incredibly thorough job, next year the data structure will be inaccurate, because CSS and its implementations evolve fast. The browser knows what the shorthands are, surely we should be able to get the information from it  …right? Then we could use it directly if this is a client-side library, or in the case of the Almanac, where code needs to be fast because it will run on millions of websites, paste the precomputed result into whatever script we run.</p>



<p>There are essentially two steps for this:</p>



<ol><li>Get a list of all CSS properties</li><li>Figure out how to test if a given property is a shorthand and how to get its longhands if so.</li></ol>



<p>I decided to tell this story in the inverse order. In my exploration, I first focused on figuring out shorthands (2), because I had coded getting a list of properties many times before, but since (1) is useful in its own right (and probably in more use cases), I felt it makes more sense to examine that first.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I’m using <code>document.body</code> instead of a dummy element in these examples, because I like to experiment in <code>about:blank</code>, and it’s just there and because this way you can just copy stuff to the console and try it wherever, even right here while reading this post. However, if you use this as part of code that runs on a real website, it goes without saying that you should create and test things on a dummy element instead!</em></p>



<h2>Getting a list of all CSS properties from the browser</h2>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, this is as simple as <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(document.body.style)</code>. However, in Firefox, this doesn’t work. Why is that? To understand this (and how to work around it), we need to dig a bit deeper.</p>



<p>In Chrome and Safari, <code>element.style</code> is a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration">CSSStyleDeclaration</a></code> instance. In Firefox however, it is a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">CSS2Properties</a></code> instance, which inherits from <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties"><code>CSS2Properties</code></a> is an older interface, defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties">the DOM 2 Specification</a>, which is now obsolete. In the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-cssstyledeclaration-interface">current relevant specification</a>, <code>CSS2Properties</code> is gone, and has been merged with <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>. However, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290786">Firefox hasn’t caught up yet</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox on the left, Safari on the right. Chrome behaves like Safari.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the properties are on <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>, they are not own properties of <code>element.style</code>, so <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames()</code> fails to return them. However, we can extract the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> instance by using <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto">__proto__</a></code> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf">Object.getPrototypeOf()</a>, and then <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body.style))</code> gives us what we want! </p>



<p>So we can combine the two to get a list of properties regardless of browser:</p>



<pre><code>let properties = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(
	style.hasOwnProperty("background")? 
	style : style.__proto__
);</code></pre>



<p>And then, we just drop non-properties, and de-camelCase:</p>



<pre><code>properties = properties.filter(p =&gt; style[p] === "") // drop functions etc
	.map(prop =&gt; { // de-camelCase
		prop = prop.replace(/[A-Z]/g, function($0) { return '-' + $0.toLowerCase() });

		if (prop.indexOf("webkit-") &gt; -1) {
			prop = "-" + prop;
		}

		return prop;
	});</code></pre>



<p>You can see a <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/eYJodjb?editors=0010">codepen with the result here</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Testing if a property is a shorthand and getting a list of longhands</h2>



<p>The main things to note are:</p>



<ul><li>When you set a shorthand on an element’s inline style, you are essentially setting all its longhands.</li><li><code>element.style</code> is actually array-like, with numerical properties and <code>.length</code> that gives you the number of properties set on it. This means you can use the spread operator on it:</li></ul>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.background = "red";
&gt; [...document.body.style] 
&lt; [
	"background-image", 
	"background-position-x", 
	"background-position-y", 
	"background-size", 
	"background-repeat-x", 
	"background-repeat-y", 
	"background-attachment", 
	"background-origin", 
	"background-clip", 
	"background-color"
]</code></pre>



<p>Interestingly, <code>document.body.style.cssText</code> serializes to <code>background: red</code> and not all the longhands.</p>



<p>There is one exception: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all">The <code>all</code> property</a>. In Chrome, it does not quite behave as a shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; document.body.style.all = "inherit";
&gt; [...document.body.style]
&lt; ["all"]</code></pre>



<p>Whereas in Safari and Firefox, it actually returns every single property <em>that is not a shorthand</em>!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Firefox and Safari expand <code>all</code> to literally all non-shorthand properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is interesting from a trivia point of view, it doesn’t actually matter for our use case, since we don’t typically care about <code>all</code> when constructing a list of shorthands, and if we do we can always add or remove it manually.</p>



<p>So, to recap, we can easily get the longhands of a given shorthand:</p>



<pre><code>function getLonghands(property) {
	let style = document.body.style;
	style[property] = "inherit"; // a value that works in every property
	let ret = [...style];
	style.cssText = ""; // clean up
	return ret;
}</code></pre>



<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>



<p>You can see how all the pieces fit together (and the output!) in <a href="https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOPEJxz?editors=0010">this codepen</a>:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>How many of these shorthands did you already know? </p>

 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 July 2020</strong></label></p><p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Near the end of 2019 I stumbled across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbK7PYQux4&amp;t=6m57s">talk</a> by procedural generation researcher <a href="https://www.anastasiaopara.com/">Anastasia Opara</a>. In the talk she presents a novel algorithm for example based texture synthesis. The goal of example based texture synthesis is to take one or more example textures and synthesize a new visually similar output texture.    </p>
<p>Here's an example from the project README:
  </p><p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/readme-example.jpeg" width="70%"> 
</p> 
<p>I was really curious about this algorithm and wanted to see if I could make it run faster as an exercise in profiling.  </p>
<p><strong>Embarking on a Journey</strong><br>
While I'm not going to go into great detail about how the algorithm works (see Anastasia's talk if you're curious!) it's helpful to understand the basic idea.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/synthesis-diagram.png" width="80%"> 
</p>

<div><p>We start with an empty output image and seed it with a few random pixels from our example images.<br>
Then repeat the following procedure until the output image is filled: </p><p> 
1. Choose an empty pixel in the output image. We will call this the center pixel.<br>
2. Find the k closest non empty pixels to the center in the output image. Note in the first few steps there might be fewer than k pixels in the entire output image. The locations of these k pixels relative to the center pixel define a neighborhood.<br>
3. Come up with a list of the most promising neighborhoods in the example image(s)<br>
4. Compare the most promising candidate neighborhoods in the example image(s) to the neighborhood around the center pixel and pick the most similar one.<br>
5. Fill the center pixel in the output image with the color of the center pixel in the best matching neighborhood.  </p></div>
<p>One last important detail is that the algorithm works on filling multiple empty pixels in parallel to take full advantage of multi core cpus.  </p>
<p><strong>Missteps and Micro optimizations</strong><br>
Now it was time to optimize. The first thing I did was to run the program on a few sample inputs with the xcode instruments profiler (partly because it was new to me). I even found a cool <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/b20eca/introducing_cargoinstruments_zerohassle_profiling/">library</a> which made it easier to use instruments with rust. Using instruments I was able to see how much each instruction contributed to the overall runtime of the program.  </p>
<p>Being able to see time per instruction was perfect for me because I was looking for micro optimizations. I'm using the term micro optimization here to mean a very small change which has a relatively large impact compared to its size. Even though they are not always a good idea, micro optimizations seemed like the best place to start because they would be less of an investment on my end. I also didn't know if the project maintainers would be excited about large code changes.  </p>
<p>Looking at the profiler output I was drawn to this line which looked like an unnecessary array resize operation nested within our once per pixel loop.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/first-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note about interpreting the numbers above is that this algorithm runs in several passes and is divided among multiple threads. The image above only shows one pass which accounts for about 12.6% of the runtime of the entire program. However each pass contains the highlighted instruction and behaves similarly. To get a rough estimate of the true impact of this instruction these percentages should be multiplied by a factor of about 8 (100/12.6). So the highlighted instruction really accounts for about 9.5% of the total program runtime.</p>
<p>After I eliminated the unnecessary array resize instruction I ran the program through the profiler again which seemed to confirm that it had gotten about 10% faster which I figured was pretty good for a first try. Of course, the profiler adds some overhead to the program, so to truly confirm that my optimization worked I needed to run it on a couple of examples without any profiling. When I did this I was shocked to see no improvement. </p>
<p>So what was happening? It turns out the cargo-instruments command I was running compiled the program in <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-does-cargo-build-not-optimise-by-default/4150">debug mode by default</a> which turned off significant optimizations. When I built the program in release mode the unnecessary array resize was automatically removed. I learned two very important lessons from this: First, of all when you benchmark you have to think carefully about what exactly you're benchmarking. Secondly, the compiler is smart and makes some micro optimizations for you.  </p>
<p>A little embarrassed and somewhat defeated, I went back to the drawing board.  </p>
<p>I grabbed a couple more profiles making sure this time to use release mode. After poking around some more I found that a significant amount of time was being spent loading pixels from the source images into intermediate buffers which were later used for neighborhood comparisons step of the algorithm.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/second-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>Again using the same runtime adjustment from the last profiling section this function seemed to take about 37.6% of the total runtime. I suspected cache misses were a significant contributor here, but regardless of the actual problem source I knew that reading the neighborhood pixels for each candidate was expensive.   </p>
<p>Of course the algorithm still needed to do the candidate neighborhood comparisons so I couldn't completely eliminate reading each candidate's neighborhood pixels. Luckily for me there was already a related optimization in the project,</p>
<p>This related optimization targeted the actual comparison step when finding a best candidate neighborhood. In the comparison step each candidate neighborhood was assigned a score by summing up the differences (always positive) between it's pixels and the target's neighborhood pixels. It turned out that often you could stop summing up these differences early if you already knew this current candidate's score was going to be higher than the best candidate's score so far.   </p>
<p>Once I understood this I just extended the idea to avoid reading the pixels needed for the unnecessary comparisons by removing the intermediate buffers and reading pixels only as they were needed which seemed to greatly reduce the average number of reads. I tested my optimization on a few different laptops with several output sizes using references images from the repository as inputs. It seemed like I had improved performance by around 15-25% depending on the output texture size, reference images and the computer I was using.  </p>
<p>Quantifying performance impact was a lot harder than I thought it would be. There were so many different parameters to the program that could affect performance: size of the reference image(s), size of the output images, number of threads. Hardware differences were also a huge factor. If I were really being rigorous I would have tried to put together a large collection of images and output sizes to benchmark off of. Due to time and budget constraints I did not assemble a super rigorous benchmark but my appreciation for the problem of performance testing has grown tremendously.  </p>
<p>Once I was confident that my micro optimization worked I made my <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/69">first pull request</a>. It was accepted but to my surprise the performance gains that the reviewers saw were not nearly as good as the ones I did. When one of them benchmarked it on an AMD Threadripper (with 64 virtual cores) the speed up was so small it might have just been noise.  </p>
<p><strong>Blocking And Locking</strong>  </p>
<p>At this point I decided to use some Google Cloud free trial credits I had lying around to spin up some larger machines to test on. Using a 64 core machine I noticed that just like on the thread ripper I didn't see much of a performance improvement from my micro optimization. I tried multiple tests with different numbers of threads (from 0 up to 64) and saw that as the number of threads increased the performance gain from my optimization dropped.  </p>
<p>So in my mind there were two explanations. First was that my optimization didn't save as much time when there were multiple threads. Second was that there was another source of latency which increased with the number of threads and that simply got so big it drowned out any noticeable effects of my optimization. It turned out this second explanation was correct.  </p>
<p>The additional source of latency turned out to be thread contention. To get the k nearest neighbors for each candidate pixel the algorithm was using a data structure called an r*tree. An r*tree provides a way to efficiently store points for nearest neighbor lookups. Exactly how an r*tree works is not actually super important here. The problem was that there was only one r*tree shared across the entire image. To prevent race conditions the r*tree had been wrapped in a read-write lock. This type of lock allows parallel reads but writes must happen in series. Reads also cannot occur while a write is in progress. With large numbers of threads, writing became a large bottleneck. Looking at a graph of program runtime versus number of cores also helps illustrate this effect.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/before-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>What I realized is that after a few pixels had been filled in the chance that one of the k nearest neighbors would be super far away from the candidate pixel was negligible. So I broke the images in to a grid of r*trees. The basic idea was that writes in two close cells could still block but writes in two far away cells could now be done in parallel. More details can be dound in <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/70">my second pull request</a>. To see the improvement from this change we can look at this graph below of synthesis speeds before / after:</p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/after-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note here is that the improved version does not scale linearly either. In an ideal world maybe it would but there are several complicating factors that are at play here. First of all the program has some initialization costs as well as having to synthesize the first few pixels in series. Both of these steps cannot be parallelized. Secondly contention is complicated and can crop up in many places. I believe I did eliminate a large source of contention but I'm sure there is more that could be done. Finally this algorithm is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> and will ultimately have to have some amount of informtion shared between threads.</p>

    <p>So far we always used shaders to render with a fixed pipeline into textures, but modern graphics card can do way more than just that (sometimes they’re also referred to as GPGPU for “general purpose graphics processing unit”). To do things that arent in the fix pipeline we’re using so far we have to use compute shaders.</p>

<p>If you’re asking yourself why we’d do that, the CPU is performant enough, especially once we use multithreading then I’m here to tell you that you’re 100% correct. You don’t need the GPU for you non graphics tasks. Using it will give you way more confusing error behaviour. The debugger wont give you as nice information and you can’t have breakpoints. Optimizing is weirder since you always have to think about what data you’re pushing around. The paralell nature of the GPU forces you to think way differently… If you don’t need compute shaders, especially when you’re not experienced, think about why you want to and if it’s making your more work than its worth.</p>

<p>If you’re still here, lets get going. In Unity you can check whether your GPU supports compute shaders by checking <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-supportsComputeShaders.html">SystemInfo.supportsComputeShaders</a>.</p>

<h2 id="basic-compute-shader">Basic Compute Shader</h2>

<p>We can get a simple compute shader by just doing <code>rclick&gt;Create&gt;Shader&gt;Compute Shader</code>. The default shader does a few calculations to write a pattern into a texture, but for this tutorial I want to go one step simpler and just write positions into an array.</p>

<p>In compute land an array we can write into is a <code>RWStructuredBuffer</code> with a certain type (<code>StructuredBuffer</code> is a array we can only read from). This type can be next to any type including vectors or structs. In our case we’ll use a float3 vector.</p>

<p>The function that calculates stuff is called the kernel. We have to add a <code>numthreads</code> attribute in front of the kernel and the kernel takes in one argument which tells us which iteration of the kernel we’re in. In our case we define the number of threads as 64 threads in the <code>x</code> dimension and 1 in both <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>. Those values should work for most platforms that support compute shaders and its in 1 dimension so we dont have to do any rethinking when writing to our 1d array. The input argument is also 3d for that reason but for now we only care about the x part. We do have to mark it as <code>SV_DispatchThreadID</code> though so the correct value is assigned to it.</p>

<p>To tell unity which functions are just regular functions that are called from somewhere else and which ones are the kernel functions we add a pragma statement, so <code>#pragma kernel &lt;functionname&gt;</code>. Its possible to have multiple kernels per shader file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each #kernel tells which function to compile; you can have many kernels</span>

<p>As a starting point I’ll just let the program write a id,0,0 positions in the buffer we set up.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="executing-compute-shaders">Executing Compute Shaders</h2>

<p>Unlike graphics shaders compute shaders can’t just be assigned to a material and via that to a object. Instead we trigger the execution ourselves from c# code.</p>

<p>In the C# component we create we reference our compute shader via a variable of the type <code>ComputeShader</code>. We also create a integer to store the identifier of our kernel after getting it once in the start method. To get the kernel identifier we call the <code>FindKernel(&lt;kernelname&gt;)</code> function on our compute shader. And after getting the kernel identifier we can use it to get the size of each thread group (thats equal to our <code>numthreads</code> in the shader). We store the x size in a variable and discard the others by passing in <code>_</code> as a output variable.</p>

<p>Lets also make the length of the buffer we’re filling a public property so we can change that in the future. With that information available we can also create the gpu array we’ll write to as a <code>ComputeBuffer</code>. Its constructor takes in the amount of elements as the first parameter and the size of its content as the second parameter. Since we’re using float3 on the shader side, we can get the size(in bytes) of a float with the <code>sizeof</code> function and multiply the result by 3(getting the size of a Vector3 or a float3 of the new mathematics lib is also possible, but only in a unsafe context and that sounds scary(it isn’t really, but whatever)). Paralell to the ComputeBuffer lets also create a regular Vector3 array of the same size, we’ll use it later to copy the data back to the ram where we can use it. If we want to write clean code (we kinda do) we should also call <code>Dispose</code> on our buffer when the component is destroyed so unity can do garbage collection, so lets add that to the OnDestroy method.</p>

<p>With all of that set up we can use the shader in the update method. First we declare set the buffer of the shader to be our buffer, this buffer is set per kernel so we also have to pass in our kernel identifier.
To dispatch the shader we first calculate how many threadgroups we need, in our case we want the amount of threads to be the length of the array, so the thread groups should be that amount divided by the thread size rounded up. When dealing with integers the easiest way of doing a division and getting the rounded up result is to add the divisor minus one before the division, that adds 1 to the result unless the dividend is a exact multiple of the divisor.
After thats done we can dispatch the shader and tell it how many thread groups it should run (the amount we just calculated in <code>x</code>, and 1 in <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>). And then we can already get the data out of the buffer into ram we can work with in C# with the aptly named <code>GetData</code> function.</p>

<p>Now we have the data but we can’t see it. There are ways of rendering the buffer directly on the GPU, but this is not the tutorial for that, instead I decided to instantiate a bunch of prefabs and use them for visualisation. The instanced transforms are saved in a private array which is created and filled with new prefab instances in the start method. The length of the array is the same length of the buffer.</p>

<p>In update method we then copy the positions from the output struct to the local position of the objects.</p>

<h2 id="a-tiny-bit-more-complex-compute-shader">A tiny bit more complex Compute Shader</h2>

<p>The rest of this is just to make stuff look nice, its just plain hlsl like in all my other tutorials.</p>

<p>In the Compute Shader I first include the functions from <a href="https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/2018/09/02/white-noise.html">my tutorial on randomness</a> and add a new variable called time.
In the kernel function I get a random vector(based on the kernel index), normalize it and get it to a random length between 0.1 and 1 (if I let it go too short bad math can happen too easily and some points become NaN). Then I generate a new vector thats orthogonal to that one by taking the cross product between the vector and a different random vector(this isn’t guaranteed to work, if the vectors are paralell the cross product is <code>(0,0,0)</code> and can’t e normalized, but it works well enough) and give its length the same treatment to make it be between 0.1 and 0.9. The random looking numbers I add to the inputs are to avoid some of the symmetry so not all random functions return the same result. Then I get a time variable by multiplying the time by 2(that 2 could be a uniform value if you want to adjust the speed manually) and give it a offset by a random value multiplied by some big-ish odd number.</p>

<p>Those values can then be combined by multiplying one of the vectors by the sine of the time and the other by the cosine of the time and adding the 2 results. I then also multiplied it by 20 to make it bigger, but you should also consider using a property settable from outside here(do as I say not as I do).</p>

    <p>Words are powerful, and the way we use them can have a tremendous impact on the people who hear us speaking.</p>
<p>But it is not only negative words that can harm us. Sometimes even the use of positive words can have a totally unexpected effect on people.</p>
<h2 id="an-experiment">An Experiment</h2>
<p>Claudia M. Mueller and Carol S. Dweck of Columbia University did a series of experiments<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that measured how the type of feedback children receive affects their behavior and motivation. Across six studies, they gave three sets of tasks to children (fifth graders):</p>
<ul>
<li>set #1 was easy, and each kid was told they had &gt;= 80% correct answers regardless of their actual performance;</li>
<li>set #2 was hard (appropriate to seventh graders), and each kid was told they had &lt;=50% correct answers irrespective of their actual performance;</li>
<li>set #3 was easy;</li>
</ul>
<p>After the first set, children were praised in one of the following three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Praise on ability: “You did very well, you must be smart at these problems.”</li>
<li>Praise on effort: “You did very well, you must have worked hard at these problems.”</li>
<li>Neutral praise: “You did very well.” (this was the control group)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, after the first set of problems, kids were given a choice to select some tasks to work on after the experiment. Unbeknownst to them, those tasks embodied different goals: 3 types of tasks represented variations of performance goals (by doing them, kids could showcase their abilities), and one job represented a learning goal (by doing which kids would learn something rather than display how smart they are).</p>
<p>After the second set of problems, all kids were informed they have performed “a lot worse.” They were asked then to rate their desire to persist on the tasks, their enjoyment of the problems, the quality of their performance, and why they think they have failed.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/ability-vs-effort.png" alt="Praise on ability vs. praise on effort"></p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>What scientists found out is incredible. The gist of experiments is that children praised for intelligence had lower levels of persistence, enjoyment, and performance on the more difficult tasks. They viewed their failure as something out of their control (“I’m just not smart enough”). Conversely, children praised for effort showed higher engagement levels and persisted more when they encountered harder tasks. More importantly, they viewed their failure as something they have control over (“I didn’t work hard enough”), and they did not appear to consider intelligence to be determined from any single performance like their ability praise counterparts did. And children in the control group were in the middle—their response was worse than those praised for effort but better than those praised for intelligence.</p>
<p>Among other interesting findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children praised for intelligence after success chose problems that allowed them to continue to exhibit good performance (allowing them to show off their abilities). In contrast, children praised for hard work chose problems that promised increased learning.</li>
<li>Children praised for intelligence preferred to learn about the performance of others on the tasks rather than learn about new strategies for solving the problems. On the other hand, children praised for effort demonstrated their continued interest in mastery by preferring to receive strategy-related information.</li>
<li>Children praised for intelligence showed a greater tendency to misrepresent their scores on the problems than those praised for effort, even though their reports were anonymous and were not seen by the experimenter.</li>
<li>Children praised for ability saw failure as an invalidation of their intelligence more than the other groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What Does It Mean</h2>
<p>The implications of this are tremendous. It means children who are praised for ability have lower motivation and are not inclined to continue to learn more since, for them, intelligence is something you either have or not. Moreover, the tasks they choose usually aim at showcasing their existing talents, rather than attempting to learn something new.</p>
<p>Considering how ubiquitous praising for ability is in the modern world, it might explain to some degree why so many people refuse to learn continuously and only seek to validate their skill set by choosing tasks they cannot get wrong, and that make them look good.</p>
<p>It also shows that alongside the importance of the education system, everyday communication within the family is critical as well. The family and friends have maybe even a more considerable significance. If scientists managed to get that kind of behavior from children after offering feedback two times only, imagine how potent is the (sometimes misleading) self-perception of those kids after reinforcing their smartness over decades by parents who (sometimes unmeritedly) are saying their kids are the best.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not only about the younger generation. Adults were all children in the past and went through the same thing. The only difference is that while you still can do something about how kids get treated and how they perceive themselves, it is extremely hard (and in some cases impossible) to make a grown-up review their self-perception.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			
<p>This is a chapter from an upcoming book&nbsp;<strong>Team Lead 101: Manage and Grow Engineering Teams in Small Startups</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://gum.co/team-lead-101">Pre-order the book for half of the price here.</a></p>



<hr>



<p>A team lead’s main concerns are team performance, interactions with other teams, and delivering projects on time.</p>



<p>Team leads should not be a bottleneck. You shouldn’t assign the most important and/or most complex tasks to yourself. You shouldn’t tie all processes to yourself.</p>



<p>Trust and acceptance of failures is the best way to eliminate yourself as a bottleneck. You should allow teammates to make mistakes, but it’s also important to be in control of how crucial mistakes will be.</p>



<p>As a team lead, you should trust your teammates and give them challenging and meaningful tasks. They need to feel their importance. By challenging them, you create growth opportunities. No one wants to be bored with tedious tasks all the time.</p>



<p>Look for a balance. Tasks that are too challenging can make the programmer question their confidence. Too many challenges will put them under unhealthy constant stress.</p>



<p>With self-doubts and stress, a member of your team will work on their tasks exponentially slower than they could with confidence and a good mood.</p>



<p>You can offer help when you notice that your teammate is struggling. Watch for signs from their mood. The simple question “How are things going?” is a tool to spot the problems.</p>



<p>By listening to your colleagues about their troubles and obstacles, you help them relieve their tension and regain their feeling of confidence. And if you can offer advice on how to solve the problem, that’s even better!</p>



<p>Pairing up with a colleague in trouble is another way to unblock the project.</p>



<p>By not burdening yourself with important projects with tight deadlines, you create time. Use this time to:</p>



<ul><li>Be conscious of the current state of your team members</li><li>Be available to offer help</li><li>Think about processes, what is working, and what is not</li><li>Think about current, upcoming, and past projects</li></ul>



<p>A good team lead does the following:</p>



<ul><li>Assigns important, challenging projects to teammates</li><li>Assigns blocking tasks to teammates</li><li>Is available to listen and offer help to teammates</li><li>Has time to be aware of the current state of team members</li><li>Has time to reflect on processes and projects</li></ul>

<p>One fun aspect of building a 3D renderer in R (and more generally, building anything in a programming language with a REPL) is the lack of friction between your code your results: rather than constructing a 3D scene by hand using a GUI, you can generate your scene directly from data or purely from logic. For traditional 3D rendering, this isn’t particularly useful, but for visualizing data and procedurally-generated systems, this close link allows for fast iteration and reproducibility.</p>
<p>Rayrender was built around this idea: instead of trying to integrate an external renderer into the R ecosystem (which is difficult for many reasons, primarily CRAN requirements), it made sense to build a 3D renderer designed specifically for R. There’s one big hurdle you encounter when writing your own software, however: in the beginning, there is no one but you who knows how to use it! “If you build it, they will come” is not a viable strategy for software. Regardless of how useful you think your package/application is, few people are going to take the time to learn it unless they’re presented with motivating examples. So, with that in mind, I’m always on the lookout for interesting and novel visualization ideas that will give people a better idea of what rayrender is capable of, and hopefully inspire them to experiment with the software.</p>
<p>What does all this have to do with 3D trees? Back in April, <a href="https://twitter.com/djnavarro">Danielle Navarro</a> released an the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/flametree">flametree</a> package, which produces procedural 2D trees using a stochastic L-system, and I thought: I think these would look really cool in 3D! So I dove into her code. It wasn’t too difficult to generalize it to 3D, write a layer that translated the resulting data structure into rayrender’s tibble-based scene format using rayrender primitives, and package it all up for easy installation. And that brings us to…</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tylermorganwall/raybonsai">raybonsai</a> package! A package that creates and renders procedural 3D trees in R. Installation is easy: just use the <code>remotes</code> package to install from Github:</p>
<pre><code>remotes::install_github("tylermorganwall/raybonsai")</code></pre>
<p>There are currently only two user-facing functions in raybonsai: <code>generate_tree()</code> and <code>render_tree()</code>. <code>generate_tree()</code> generates a tree that follows a certain set of constraints that you set and returns a rayrender scene describing the tree. <code>render_tree()</code> automatically adds ground, sets up lighting, and sets up the camera so the tree is in frame, but is otherwise just a light wrapper around rayrender’s <code>render_scene()</code> function.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out, with the default settings:</p>
<pre><code>library(raybonsai)

generate_tree() %&gt;% 
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<center><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-2-1.jpg" width="800"></center>
<center></center>
<p>A tree! Let’s customize it. The growth of the tree is controlled primarily using five inputs: the number of branches at each branching point <code>branch_split</code>, the horizontal branching angle <code>branch_angle</code>, the vertical branching angle <code>branch_angle_vert</code>, the scaled length of each subsequent branch <code>branch_scale</code>, and (most appropriately named, given the use case) the random seed <code>seed</code>. Let’s first start by generating a bunch of different plants, each with the same settings but different seeds.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for(i in 1:9) {
  generate_tree(seed = i) %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-3-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 2: Collection of different trees, varying the random seed.</div></center>

<p>Each tree is different, but they all appear to come from the same “species.” And that’s because they’re all generated using the same “DNA”: the branch angles and scaling factors. Let’s change that DNA by specifying a new set of rules. Here, we cut the potential angles the branches can make from -45 and 45 degrees in half:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for(i in 1:9) {
  generate_tree(seed = i, branch_angle_vert = seq(-45,45,by=5)/2, leaf_color = "pink") %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-4-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 3: Varying the vertical branching angle.</div></center>

<p>These are visually quite distinct from the previous batch and have a similar appearance to each other. But look closely and compare these trees with the first batch: you’ll see that they actually have the exact same branching structure, just with less pronounced branching angles (note the trees than lean left/right in the first batch still lean that way in the second). This is because the random choice whether to branch left or right is controlled by the random seed, which is identical between the two batches. The only variable that’s different is the branching angle itself.</p>




<p>What happens when we add an addition angle into the mix? Here, one directly in the center. Now, each branch can either go left, right, or continue in the same direction as the source branch. We can see this results in some trees developing “trunks" and some longer straight branches:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(i in 1:6) {
  generate_tree(seed = i, branch_angle_vert = c(-20,0, 20), leaf_color = "red") %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-5-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 4: Adding the possibility of growing a branch in the same direction as the previous.</div></center>

<p>The next variable we can control is increase the branching depth of the tree. By default, we generate 6 branch layers. The number of branches grows exponentially with each layer, so we’ll just increase it to 8. This will increase the visual complexity of our tree.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(i in 1:6) {
  generate_tree(seed = i+1000, branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "purple") %&gt;% 
    render_tree()
}</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-6-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center></center>

<p>By default, raybonsai only adds leaves to the last layer, but we can start growing them on earlier layers to fill in our tree:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))

generate_tree(seed = 1234, branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "orange") %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 1234, branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "orange", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;%
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-7-1.jpg" width="1600"></div>
<center><div>Figure 6: Filling in our tree with additional leaves.</div></center>

<p>Up to this point, we’ve kept the trees symmetric by setting a matching negative angle for every positive angle. We can also make asymmetric trees by increasing the probability that we’ll select one angle over another. Here each branch has a 5x probability of turning one way versus the other, implemented by duplicating one angle 5x in the branching vector.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))
generate_tree(seed = 2020, branch_angle_vert = c(-10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "magenta", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()
generate_tree(seed = 2021, branch_angle_vert = c(10,-10,-10,-10,-10,-10),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "magenta", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;%
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-8-1.jpg" width="1600"></div>
<center></center>

<p>We can also create asymmetric trees by ensuring the average angle is negative or positive, without repeating individual angles. This works because on average, the tree favors one direction over the other.</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))
generate_tree(seed = 4321, branch_angle_vert = seq(-10,20,by=1),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "yellow", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 4321, branch_angle_vert = -seq(-10,20,by=1),
              branch_depth = 8, leaf_color = "yellow", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-9-1.jpg" width="1600"></div>
<center><div>Figure 8: More tree bending.</div></center>

<p>Another variable we can control is the scaling factor <code>branch_scale</code>, which defaults to <code>c(0.8, 0.9)</code> (meaning each branch is either 80% or 90% the length of the previous layer). If we decrease or increase this, the resulting tree will be dramatically different:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,3))
generate_tree(seed = 10, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.6,0.7),
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "green", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 11, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.9,1),
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "green", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()

generate_tree(seed = 12, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(1.1,1.2),
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "green", leaf_depth_start = 5) %&gt;% 
  render_tree()</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-10-1.jpg" width="2400"></div>
<center><div>Figure 9: Varying the branch width.</div></center>

<p>Each tree so far has been grown with the “midpoint” method: rather than growing each branch from the end of the previous branch, the default behavior extends the branch in the previous branches direction until it reaches the halfway point, and only then extends a branch to the endpoint. We can turn off this feature and by setting <code>midpoint = FALSE</code>: This results in a structurally identical tree with a slightly different appearance. And for fun, let’s also play around with the ground color and the branch color:</p>
<pre><code>par(mfrow=c(1,2))
generate_tree(seed = 20, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.9,1), midpoint = TRUE,
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "chartreuse4", 
              leaf_depth_start = 5, branch_color = "tan") %&gt;% 
  render_tree(ground_color1 = "darkgoldenrod4", ground_color2 = "chocolate4")

generate_tree(seed = 20, branch_angle = c(-30,0, 30), branch_scale = c(0.9,1), midpoint = FALSE,
              branch_depth = 7, leaf_color = "chartreuse4", 
              leaf_depth_start = 5, branch_color = "tan") %&gt;% 
  render_tree(ground_color1 = "darkgoldenrod4", ground_color2 = "chocolate4")</code></pre>
<div><img src="https://www.tylermw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/smallunnamed-chunk-11-1.jpg" width="1600"></div>
<center><div>Figure 10: Two different methods of growing branches. Left: midpoint. Right: not midpoint.</div></center>

<p>The lighting here is automatically set up by <code>render_tree()</code>, but we can turn it off and set up our own lighting using rayrender. We’ll also set <code>branch_split = 3</code> here for a denser tree with more branches:</p>
<pre><code>library(rayrender)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
generate_tree(seed = 222, branch_angle = c(-20, 20), branch_scale = c(0.8,0.9), branch_split = 3,
              branch_depth = 6 , leaf_color = "chartreuse4", 
              leaf_depth_start = 5, branch_color = "tan") %&gt;% 
  add_object(sphere(x=5,y=1,radius=1,material=light(color="magenta",intensity = 30))) %&gt;%
  add_object(sphere(x=-5,y=1,radius=1,material=light(color="dodgerblue",intensity = 30))) %&gt;%
  raybonsai::render_tree(lights = FALSE, ground_color1 = "grey50",ground_color2 = "grey50", …</code></pre></div></article></section></div></main></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Can Audio Deepfakes Really Fake a Human?</strong></p>
<p>Audio deepfakes are the new frontier for business compromise schemes and are becoming more common pathways for criminals to deceptively gain access to corporate funds. Nisos recently investigated and obtained an original attempted deepfake synthetic audio used in a fraud attempt against a technology company. The deepfake took the form of a voicemail message from the company’s purported CEO, asking an employee to call back to “finalize an urgent business deal.” The recipient immediately thought it suspicious and did not contact the number, instead referring it to their legal department, and as a result the attack was not successful.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nisos investigated the phone number the would-be attacker used and determined it was a VOIP service with no owner registration information. It was likely simply acquired and used as a “burner” for this fraud attempt only. While there was no actual voicemail message associated with the number, we made no attempt for live contact with the owner of the phone number for legal reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Deepfake Audio Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Nisos analyzed the deepfake voicemail audio recording with an audio spectrogram tool called Spectrum3d. Looking to detect any anomalies, we immediately noticed the highs spiking repeatedly in the spectrogram (see graphic below). We initially suspected the deepfake creator used audio playing over on multiple channels to help mask the voice.</p>
<p><strong><i><img src="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=351&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png" alt="pasted image 0 (7)" width="351" srcset="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=176&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 176w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=351&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 351w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=527&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 527w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=702&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 702w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=878&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 878w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=1053&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"></i></strong><strong><i>Graphic 1: Spectrogram analysis of the deepfake audio, displaying major inconsistencies in pitch and tone.</i></strong></p>
<p>We additionally noticed the audio was very choppy and not consistent with a similar human voice recording. When we altered the audio speed and played back at 1.2 speed, the audio then sounded more like a standard text to speech system. Most interesting, when we amplified the sound to detect any background noise we were unable to find any traces, which further indicated this was manipulated audio.</p>
<p>We then compared the deepfake spectrogram analysis with results of a "normal" human voice on a similar recording. We can immediately see how the pitch and tone is more smoothed out, as well as the ability to detect faint background noise.</p>
<p><strong><i><img src="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=351&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png" alt="unnamed (4)" width="351" srcset="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=176&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 176w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=351&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 351w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=527&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 527w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=702&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 702w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=878&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 878w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=1053&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"></i></strong><strong><i>Graphic 2: Spectrogram analysis of ‘normal’ human voice, displaying more consistent pitch and tone.</i></strong></p>
<p>We were unable to determine the exact software or voice model used to create this deepfake as we would have required access to a large enough sample of the attacker’s other deepfake audio files (we would likely need tens if not hundreds of files, and this assumes the attacker made more than just this one). However, we note several complicating factors an actor would have to overcome to create a more realistic deepfake audio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capturing high quality audio with little to no background noise.</li>
<li>Staging the call for audio delivering in a realistic scenario (tone of the person talking, background noise and reason for the call) in which the person wouldn’t feel the need to call the person back.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Finding a way to leave a message, so they can avoid an in-person conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely the attacker in this scenario above utilized a feature most cell/VOIP service providers offer, which is the ability to bypass the ring option and go straight into the voice mail using the `#` key.</p>

<p><strong>Has This Happened Before?</strong></p>
<p>The most famous use of deep fake synthetic audio technology in criminal fraud was a September 2019 incident involving a British energy company. The criminals reportedly used voice-mimicking software to imitate the British executive’s speech and trick his subordinate into sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to a secret account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The managing director of this company, believing his boss was on the phone, followed orders to wire more than $240,000 to an account in Hungary.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Symantec security researchers reported in February on three cases of audio deepfakes used against private companies by impersonating the voice of the business’s CEO.<sup>2 </sup>The criminals reportedly trained machine learning engines from audio obtained on conference calls, YouTube, social media updates and even TED talks, to copy the voice patterns of company bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They created audio deepfakes replicating the CEO’s voice and called senior members of the finance department to ask for funds to be sent urgently. There was no additional reporting on which companies these were, whether the techniques were successful, or whether Symantec was able to obtain recordings of the deepfakes themselves.</p>
<p>Without actual digital capture of the audio, and additional forensics analysis, it is unclear whether these attempts were in fact deepfake synthetic manipulated audio. Regardless, the ability to generate synthetic audio extends an e-criminal’s toolkit and the criminal at the end of the day still has to effectively use social engineering tactics to induce someone into taking an action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminals and potentially broader nation state actors also learn from each other, so as these high-profile cases gain more notoriety and success, we anticipate more illicit actors trying them and learning from others who have paved the way.</p>
<p>Additionally, as deepfakes become easier to create or purchase, and the quality of synthetic manipulation -both audio (and video)- increases, we anticipate wider deployment of these e-crime exploits. If a fraud operation requires the use of a completely fake doctored video or audio for maximum impact, and it is worth the money and resources, it will be used. However, Nisos researchers have not seen the ability to easily outsource this type of deepfake for single individual or mass production.</p>
<p>Our researchers have contact with a few deepfake channels where we asked about this type of attack vector and participants were unsure something like this would be possible in the near future. The central issue with audio deepfakes has to do with capturing not only the person’s tone but also specific speech mannerisms. Future scenarios will likely materialize, however, where tools similar to a Yandex reverse image search (but for voice) could be used to gather numerous samples and then build and train a model that could help convert the source voice into the target voice.</p>

<p><strong>What Can Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>The most immediate action an employee can take, if they sense something suspicious in a voicemail (or any audio) instruction, is to call the person back directly using a known number and get them on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake technology is not sophisticated enough to mimic an entire phone call with someone. Additionally, the company can exercise a series of ‘challenge questions’ using information that is not publicly known or conversation points that an actor could not readily answer, to vet the identity of the individual on the line.</p>
<p>This fraud scheme is a form of a business email compromise (a more sophisticated and AI-developed version) where typically the attacker will pretend to be a senior executive at a company and get a more susceptible ‘lower-level’ employee to send money to a bank account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would anticipate a deepfake audio would be the first step in a series of social engineering attempts to get an employee to wire money to a specific location. Phishing emails, additional phone calls, or even deepfake videos purporting to authorize an action could be used in furtherance of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake audio may also be used for reasons ancillary to the ones listed above. For example, criminals can leave fake messages instructing employees to provide network or physical access to the company, allowing attackers to easily compromise the network or physical assets of the company.</p>
<p>The availability of this nascent but rapidly-emerging technology emphasizes the criticality with which companies must develop security practices that encompass these measures. Any time an unusual incident occurs, and certainly when large financial transactions are involved, employees should be trained to ask challenge questions to senior executives.</p>

      <article>
  
  <header>
    Posted on <time datetime="2020-07-22">22 July 2020</time>
  </header>
  <p>I happen to develop a pet project of mine on a Linux desktop, while actually targeting an <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> server. Thus I searched for a scriptable way to install OpenBSD on the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> virtual machine manager, such that I could automate a local integration test against OpenBSD running on Linux.</p>
<p>As expected, OpenBSD has a remarkably straightforward unattended installation solution. During a normal, interactive installation, you answer a series of questions like what timezone you are in or which file sets to install. At the end of the installation, the installer sends a recorded list of those questions along with your answers to the root user’s mail box. You can then adapt this so-called <em>response file</em> to your needs and feed it to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a> command to perform an unattended installation.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this post, I will show how to auto-install OpenBSD/amd64 6.7 on the QEMU PC system emulator 5.0.0. In the end, I will present a simple yet <a href="https://www.skreutz.com/files/autoinstall-openbsd-on-qemu.sh">complete POSIX shell script</a> to get the job done. The script is intended to run on Linux, though. If you already have a running OpenBSD installation, you should consider to use OpenBSD’s own hypervisor <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/vmm">vmm(4)</a> instead of QEMU as described in the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq16.html">OpenBSD FAQ</a> and in this <a href="http://eradman.com/posts/autoinstall-openbsd.html">blog post</a> by Eric Radman.</p>
<p>We will perform the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install several prerequisites</li>
<li>Setup a local OpenBSD mirror</li>
<li>Configure the installation</li>
<li>Setup a network boot environment</li>
<li>Install the virtual machine</li>
<li>Log in to the virtual machine</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>We will use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, a data transfer tool (and library)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>, a remote login tool</li>
<li><a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor)</li>
<li><a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>, an incremental file transfer tool</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aperezdc/signify">signify</a>, a cryptographic signature tool<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>, a successor of the infamous TCP/IP Swiss Army knife <a href="https://nc110.sourceforge.io/">netcat</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are that your Linux distribution of choice packages these tools. For example, the following command installs them on Arch Linux:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pacman -S curl openssh qemu rsync signify socat</code></pre>
<h2 id="local-openbsd-mirror">Local OpenBSD mirror</h2>
<p>To begin with, we setup a partial, local <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html">OpenBSD mirror</a>.</p>
<p>First, we create the relevant part of the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html#layout">directory layout</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code></pre>
<p>Second, we fetch the base public key from the official HTTPS mirror using <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">curl(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl \
    --output mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/openbsd-67-base.pub \
    https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/openbsd-67-base.pub</code></pre>
<p>Third, we fetch the kernel, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Preboot_Execution_Environment&amp;oldid=955913424">PXE</a> bootstrap program, and the file sets from an untrusted <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html#rsync">rsync mirror</a> using <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1">rsync(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ rsync --archive --files-from=- --verbose \
    rsync://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/openbsd/6.7/amd64/ \
    mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64 \
    &lt;&lt; EOF
SHA256.sig
base67.tgz
bsd
bsd.mp
bsd.rd
comp67.tgz
game67.tgz
man67.tgz
pxeboot
xbase67.tgz
xfont67.tgz
xserv67.tgz
xshare67.tgz
EOF</code></pre>
<p>Fourth, we verify the fetched files using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/signify">signify(1)</a> and the previously fetched base public key:<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>$ ( cd mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64 &amp;&amp; signify -C \
    -p ../openbsd-67-base.pub \
    -x SHA256.sig \
    -- bsd bsd.* pxeboot *67.tgz )</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we serve the local mirror at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/</a>. Feel free to use your web server of choice. Chances are, that your Linux distribution comes with Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html">http.server</a> module:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 \
    -m http.server \
    --directory mirror \
    --bind 127.0.0.1 8080</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>First, we create a response file for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a> at <code>mirror/install.conf</code>:<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>Change the default console to com0 = yes
Which speed should com0 use = 115200
System hostname = openbsd
Password for root = *************
Allow root ssh login = no
Setup a user = puffy
Password for user = *************
Public ssh key for user = ssh-rsa AAAAB3N... alex@example
What timezone are you in = UTC
Location of sets = http
HTTP Server = 10.0.2.1
Unable to connect using https. Use http instead = yes
URL to autopartitioning template for disklabel = http://10.0.2.1/disklabel
Set name(s) = site67.tgz
Checksum test for site67.tgz failed. Continue anyway = yes
Unverified sets: site67.tgz. Continue without verification = yes</code></pre>
<p>Take care to insert your own public SSH key here, for example, the contents of <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we effectively disable password-based authentication here by assigning the conventional 13 asterisks as encrypted passwords for both users, <code>root</code> and <code>puffy</code>, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/passwd.5">passwd(5)</a>. Instead, we enable the user <code>puffy</code> to login using the given SSH key. Besides, we will later permit the user <code>puffy</code> to run any command as root without entering his password using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/doas">doas(1)</a>.</p>
<p>Note also that we will later instruct QEMU to redirect port 80 on the virtual network address 10.0.2.1 to port 8080 on the local host.</p>
<p>Next, we create a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> template at <code>mirror/disklabel</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/            2G
swap         8G
/tmp         1G
/var         1G
/usr         2G
/usr/X11R6 500M
/usr/local   4G
/usr/src     1M
/usr/obj     1M
/home        4G</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we create an optional site-specific file set. This way, we can run some commands at the end of the installation. Here, we reset the OpenBSD mirror server used by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a> and other commands.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, we permit the user group <code>wheel</code> — and thus the user <code>puffy</code> — to run any command as the user <code>root</code> without entering their password using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/doas">doas(1)</a>.</p>
<p>Create the file <code>site/install.site</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#! /bin/ksh
set -o errexit
echo "https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD" &gt; /etc/installurl
echo "permit nopass keepenv :wheel" &gt;&gt; /etc/doas.conf</code></pre>
<p>Then, make the file executable, package the file set, and add it to the local OpenBSD mirror:</p>
<pre><code>$ chmod +x site/install.site
$ ( cd site &amp;&amp; tar -czf ../mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/site67.tgz . )
$ ( cd mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64 &amp;&amp; ls -l &gt; index.txt )</code></pre>
<h2 id="network-boot-environment">Network boot environment</h2>
<p>We create a dedicated directory to serve the OpenBSD kernel and PXE bootstrap program over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol&amp;oldid=959587822">TFTP</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir tftp
$ ln -s ../mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/pxeboot tftp/auto_install
$ ln -s ../mirror/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/bsd.rd tftp/bsd.rd</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, we create a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/man8/amd64/boot.8">boot(8)</a> configuration file at <code>tftp/etc/boot.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>stty com0 115200
set tty com0
boot tftp:/bsd.rd</code></pre>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>First, we create a copy-on-write disk image using <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/tools/qemu-img.html">qemu-img(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow2 24G</code></pre>
<p>Then, we start a virtual machine — and thus the unattended installation of OpenBSD — off this disk using <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/qemu-manpage.html">qemu-system-x86_64(1)</a> and <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html">socat(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -smp "cpus=4" \
    -m 4G \
    -drive "file=disk.qcow2,media=disk,if=virtio" \
    -device e1000,netdev=n1 \
    -netdev "user,id=n1,hostname=openbsd-vm,tftp-server-name=10.0.2.1,tftp=tftp,bootfile=auto_install,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.1:80-cmd:socat STDIO TCP4:127.0.0.1:8080" \
    -nographic</code></pre>
<p>Let’s break this last command down. The <code>-enable-kvm</code> option enables the Linux <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/">Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)</a> support. The <code>-smp</code> option instructs QEMU to simulate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symmetric_multiprocessing&amp;oldid=951686602">symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)</a> system. The <code>-m</code> option sets the amount of virtual memory. The <code>-drive</code> option attaches the previously created copy-on-write disk image as a <a href="https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a> disk drive. The <code>-device</code> option attaches a standard network adapter. The <code>-netdev</code> option configures a virtual network <code>10.0.2.0/24</code> where <code>10.0.2.2</code> and <code>10.0.2.15</code> point to the QEMU host and guest respectively. Moreover, we instruct QEMU to (a) run an embedded TFTP server at <code>10.0.2.1</code>, (b) redirect port 2222 on the host to port 22 on the guest, and (c) redirect port 80 on the virtual host address <code>10.0.2.1</code> to port 8080 on the host. The former port redirection enables us to log in to the guest using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, and the latter port redirection frees us from binding to the privileged port 80 on the host.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Finally, the <code>-nographic</code> option turns QEMU into a command-line application that redirects the emulated serial port to the console. Press <code>C-a x</code> to stop the virtual machine, or <code>C-a h</code> to show other options.</p>
<h2 id="login">Login</h2>
<p>Once the virtual machine has booted, you can log in as the user <code>puffy</code> using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/ssh">ssh(1)</a>:</p>
<pre><code>ssh \
  -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" \
  -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null" \
  -o "Port 2222" \
  puffy@127.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>Here, we use the <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> and <code>UserKnownHostsFile</code> options to keep the presumably temporary virtual machine’s host key out of our known hosts file.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We auto-installed OpenBSD/amd64 6.7 on the QEMU PC system emulator 5.0.0 by means of several command-line tools. First, we setup a partial, local OpenBSD mirror using <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1">rsync(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/signify">signify(1)</a>. Second, we prepared a response file for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/autoinstall">autoinstall(8)</a>, a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/disklabel">disklabel(8)</a> template, and a site-specific file set. Third, we setup a standard network boot environment. Fourth, we actually installed OpenBSD on a QEMU guest machine. Finally, we logged in to the virtual machine using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.7/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can automate the whole process. For example, I use a simple, yet <a href="https://www.skreutz.com/files/autoinstall-openbsd-on-qemu.sh">complete POSIX shell script</a> to auto-install OpenBSD on QEMU. In fact, I have written another script to install and test the said pet project of mine as well. But this is out of scope here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a first-time manager to get a single direct report. Try it out. See how it goes. Here’s what this ends up looking like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If they give feedback that their manager stinks, that’s 100% bad feedback from your reports. If the report doesn’t do well, that’s 100% of your reports that aren’t succeeding.* If the report quits, you just lost your whole team.</li>
  <li>The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. It also regularly leads to micromanagement.</li>
  <li>The single report is isolated. They don’t have any peers on the team to reach out to for help. If their manager is bad, they don’t have any corroborating voices. Anything that goes wrong is a they-said I-said debate. Any debate inside of the team is a faceoff with your manager.</li>
  <li>No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. A report could look to teammates to corroborate or dissuade their ideas. With one report, disagreements have little additional evidence, so people have to either approach the situation with a supreme lack of ego, or they can just assume it’s the other person’s fault. Guess which option happens most.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. This compounds the issue. Straight-from-college hires don’t have great context for what it means to be in industry, to have a manager, to work a job with no end-of-semester in sight. And hires aren’t expected to have as much autonomy in their formative early years. With these variables, the requirements on the manager are higher than average.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, consider doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html">anti-pattern</a> for more reasons than just this one.</li>
  <li>Try and make sure the manager of a team with 1 individual contributor is also an expert in the domain area. Sometimes managers are explicitly not the domain expert by design, but when you have 1 report, a lack of domain expertise is one of the sure-fire ways to make mistakes and a sure-fire way for your report to get the idea that you’re no good.</li>
  <li>Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Note: mangers should be very invested in their report’s success. But when the manager is <em>over-invested</em> it leads to all sorts of unsavory things, some of which are called out above. Another example is when a report is doing well-enough, but because the manager is <em>over-reliant</em> on their performance, they try to push the report beyond what they can or want to do.</p>

<p>In today’s post we’re going to talk about latencies in a common distributed
system architecture: The root-leaf, or parent-child, fanout architecture. We’ll
try to gain an intuition for what drives tail latency, derive a formula for
tying together the parent and child latency distributions, and provide a useful
interactive visualization to help understand tail latency in these systems.</p>

<h3 id="root-leaf-fanout-architecture">Root-Leaf Fanout Architecture</h3>

<p>When dealing with distributed systems, it’s a common pattern to have a root
aggregator node that fans-out requests to many leaf nodes that do work in
parallel, then send back their response to the root node to aggregate and
create a final response. Usually the API of the system is exposed through the
root-aggregator nodes, so the latency of these root nodes is what matters.</p>

<p>As seasoned distributed system developers, we know that latency (and
performance) is a
<a href="https://medium.com/lightstephq/performance-is-a-shape-not-a-number-a3c1a9ae19cc">shape not a number</a>.
What this means is that we shouldn’t concern ourselves solely with what the
average latency of a service is – we care about the full latency distribution
– and at the very least we should care about the tail. Usually people settle on
monitoring the $90^{th}$ or $99^{th}$ percentile (p90 or p99), and maybe use a
heatmap to visualize the whole latency distribution.</p>

<p>In the case of our parent-aggregator and many children setup, if we’re going to
concern ourselves with its p99 latency, it’d be nice to know for a given fanout,
how fast do our children nodes have to be to get a certain p99 parent
latency. This is also useful when debugging, but in reverse. If I see a p95
latency spike for the parent node, what percentile latency on the children nodes
do I need to care about? How does this change with the fanout size?</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the Problem</h3>

<p>Before we analyze the problem any further, we should first define exactly what
problem we’re analyzing. In its simplest form, the parent-child system has two
defining properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parent latency for a request is greater than or equal to the max of all the children latencies, since the parent must wait for all child responses.</li>
<li>Child latency inevitably has a long tail.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>These two properties mean that as we fan out to more children, our parent
latency will get worse, because we’re more likely to hit a long tail latency
event. And conversely if we can reduce our fanout or reduce the variance in our
child latency we’ll be able to drive down our overall latency.</p>

<p>What’s not immediately obvious though is the magnitude of the effect of reducing
fanout or improving child latency variance is. To try to gain some
understanding, let’s consider a situation where the child latency follows a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log normal distribution</a>
with $\mu = 3$ and $\sigma = 0.2$ and consider the latency distributions of the
child, and parents who fan out to varying number of children per request: 10,
100, 1000.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Now we’ll visualize the reconstructed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density functions</a>
based on observations from generated data, for both the children and the parents:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-child-parent-pdfs-density-plot.png" title="Density plot of child and parent latency probability density functions"></p>

<p>What’s immediately obvious is that as the fanout increases, the parent latency distribution gets worse and worse, and is dominated by the tail latency of the children. By the time we’re fanning out to 1000 children, the parent latency distribution looks almost completely unrelated to the child latency distribution. While we could have predicted this, hopefully this visualization helps build up our intuition of the problem.</p>

<h3 id="deriving-a-closed-form-solution">Deriving a Closed Form Solution</h3>

<p>We began this adventure trying to answer a question, and now it is time to return to it: <em>What child latency percentile drives a given parent latency percentile?</em></p>

<p>Although the problem is pretty simple, I wrestled with it a bit until a friend
pointed out that you can think of a percentile latency as not describing a point
in the latency distribution but instead as a <em>probability</em> that a request
finishes in a given amount of time. So if the p90 latency is 10ms, we can
reframe this as saying that the probability a request finishes within 10ms is
$90\%$.</p>

<p>When we combine this insight with the fact that a parent request only finishes
once all its children requests finish, we can derive a closed form solution to
our problem.</p>

<p>Since the parent request finishes only after all $N$ children requests finish,
then the probability the parent request finishes in time $t$, is the probability
that all $N$ children finish in time $t$. Assuming all children latencies are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
then we can calculate the parent probability as:</p>

<p>$$
P_{parent\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs} = (P_{child\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs})^N
$$</p>

<p>which when we solve for child latency percentile gives us the following formula:</p>

<p>$$
P_{child} \approx \sqrt[N]{P_{parent}}
$$</p>

<p>Now that we have a formula for our problem, we can begin inspecting some
secnarios. If we cared about the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
and the fanout was to 2 children, then we would need to care about the
$94.86^{th}$ percentile at the children, since $\sqrt{0.9} \approx 0.9486$.</p>

<p>One thing about this formula that can be surprising, is how quickly the child
percentile we have to care about grows as we increase the fanout. Even fanning
out to 20 children, and monitoring the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
we need to care about the $99.47^{th}$ percentile latency of the children!</p>

<p>The graph below shows how quickly $50^{th}$, $90^{th}$, and $99^{th}$ parent
percentile latency converges to being driven by the $100^{th}$ percentile child
latency as fanout size grows.</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout"></p>

<p>Here is a zoomed-in view focusing on the $90^{th}$ percentile and above:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile-zoomed.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout Zoomed"></p>

<p>We can see that if we’re monitoring the p90 latency of the parent, by the time we fan out to 10 children, we’ll have to start caring about the p99 latency of the children.</p>

<h3 id="trust-but-verify-and-visualize">Trust, but Verify (and Visualize)</h3>

<p>Although the formula makes sense, and the intuition behind it sounds reasonable<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, I often find it helpful when confronted with a formula to verify its correctness by simulation. So I below is a little simulation and visualization to do just that. <strong>The main spiffiness comes when you hover over a bar in either distribution</strong>, as the visualization will highlight both the percentile in its distribution as well as highlight the corresponding percentile in the other distribution:</p>






<p>The above is an example visualization generated from a generalized tool, simulating 3000 requests to a parent fanning out to 20 children, where the child latency distribution is a log normal distribution with $\mu = 3.4$ and $\sigma = 0.3$. The tool itself is <a href="https://paulcavallaro.com/standalone/fanouts.html">hosted here</a>, and the code is in this <a href="https://github.com/paulcavallaro/fanouts-and-percentiles">github repo</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can use this visualization to confirm our formula empirically. If we hover over the bar that correlates with the p95 latency in the parent distribution, our formula predicts that the child latency it corresponds to should be $\sqrt[20]{0.95} \approx .9974$ or p99.74, which is roughly what I get.</p>

<h3 id="bach-s-fanout-variations">Bach’s Fanout Variations</h3>

<p>While we now have a nice way to reason about and visualize the simplest version
of the problem, there are still many variations that would be useful to understand.</p>

<p>Here are some things we might want to do to our system to improve the overall latency:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happens if we drop the slowest child request?</li>
<li>What happens if we retry the slowest child request if it takes “too long”?</li>
<li>What happens if we send every child request to two children instead and just use the fastest response?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the first person to think about this, lots of the ideas in this section
are stolen directly from the
<a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub40801">Tail at Scale</a>, as well as things
I’ve observed in the wild.</p>

<p>This is a pretty rich topic, so hopefully in the future I can revisit it and
update the visualization to take account of these subtleties.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The repositories of distributions such as <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nixpkgs</a> are among the
<a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">largest</a> collections of open source (and some unfree) software. They
are complex systems that connect and organize many interdependent packages.
Interestingly, these systems grow out of the individual design choices of
thousands of contributors but few of them have larger design goals in mind.</p>
<p>Is it possible to capture the large scale features of such a repository in an
image? Are there common design choices of the contributors? Did they lead to
any emergent structure?</p>
<p>Plenty of studies (e.g. <a href="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/2008-TOSEM-PowerLaws/html/LSV08.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>, or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have examined these questions
from different viewpoints and for various software ecosystems. In this blog
post I’ll try to shed some light on them from the perspective of Nixpkgs,
mostly with visualizations of its complete dependency graph but also with a
very short examination of its statistical properties (its degree distribution).
But wait, you might think: “visualizing a graph with 50000 nodes and 300000
edges? - All you are going to see is black!“. Well, it turns out that this is
not the case because large scale structures appear when we look at the graph in
the right way.</p>
<h2>An overview of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Before explaining in detail what I did, let’s start with a teaser. Check out
the structure in this fascinating image where each little dot represents a
single software package in the Nixpkgs repository:</p>

<p>What looks remotely like the section of a mouse brain actually represents
around 46000 software packages. Each dot in this image corresponds to a
different one, more precisely to a Nix derivation in the Nixpkgs repository.
Each package is invisibly linked to those that it depends on (ingoing
dependencies) or those that depend on it (outgoing dependencies). These
packages are the nodes, and their invisible links the incoming and outgoing
edges of the directed dependency graph of Nixpkgs.</p>
<p>The total number of dependencies that a node has is called the node’s <em>degree</em>.
It is subdivided in the <em>in degree</em> which counts the number of ingoing
dependencies and the <em>out degree</em> which counts the number of outgoing
dependencies. I have colored and sized the nodes in the above image by their in
degree: a brighter larger node means that more derivations depend on it (high
in degree) than on a darker smaller node (low in degree). Size and color are
scaled non-linearly and should only be interpreted qualitatively. We will see
later from the distribution of these degrees why this makes sense.</p>
<p>The graph was laid out and visualized with the program <a href="https://gephi.org/">gephi</a> using a
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679">force simulation algorithm</a> to project each node to a display
positions in the image. This force model consists of attractive and repulsive
forces that drag the nodes into their final positions that you can see in the
image.</p>
<p>The attractive force pulls nodes towards their dependencies. Therefore nodes
with similar dependencies end up close to each other. Looking back at the
image, we see the effect of this force in the form of node clusters with
visible gaps between them. The repulsive force pushes nodes away from
dependencies that have high degree. High degree nodes therefore appear with a
lot of space around them. Low degree nodes, on the other hand, are tightly
packed.</p>
<p>As a final addition, a gravitational force keeps the whole graph together and
squeezes it into roughly circular form. Check out the appendix at the end of
this post for a detailed explanation, including the code and the data that are
required to reproduce this image yourself.</p>
<p>The following image of the dependency graph was laid out in the same way, but
shows the package name of each node explicitly. As before, the package names
are scaled non-linearly with the in degree of the node. The names of the
largest nodes - we’ll call them hub nodes - are well readable but to read the
labels of the smaller nodes you should click on the image and use your browsers
zoom functionality.</p>

<p>Most central to the Nixpkgs repository are the primary hub nodes <em>bash</em> and the
Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation. Unsurprisingly, most derivations depend on them - at
least at build time - because <em>bash</em> is one of the most commonly used Unix
shells and <em>stdenv</em> is a nix package that groups very fundamental build
dependencies such as GNU make. Both are used as default environments in Nix.</p>
<p>Slightly smaller secondary hub nodes can also be identified:
<em>curl</em> and <em>mirrors-list</em> seem to be central to the upper part of the graph and
indicate that it has something to do with the internet. On the right side,
<em>Python2.7</em> and <em>Python3.6</em> are visible as distinct clusters and grouped around
a central <em>hook</em> derivation that is used by Nix to setup a Python environment.
On the left side, different versions of Perl can be seen. In the bottom, the
Linux library manager tool <em>pkg-config</em> forms a little aura that matches its
importance for the open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>The hub nodes indicate that some clusters in this graph correspond to the
environments of different programming languages. Naturally packages in these
environments will have a common set of dependencies and therefore appear close
to each other in the graph.</p>
<h2>Ego networks: exploring hub node environments</h2>
<p>Let’s dive further into this. A hub node forms a little subgraph together with
its ingoing and outgoing dependencies that is sometimes called its <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/networks/egonet.htm"><em>ego network</em></a>
(this term seems to originate in studies of social networks). In the following
plot, the ego networks of a few selected hub nodes are colored in green. The
corresponding hub node’s name is indicated above each subplot. It illustrates
nicely how clusters form around a compiler, an interpreter or just an important

<p>The ego networks confirm our previous intuition that some clusters correspond
to different programming languages. They also provide basic orientation on this
graph. Here is a short description of the different ego networks:</p>
<p>Most of the upper part of the graph is dominated by <em>curl</em>. Closer inspection
shows that most of these derivations are archives such as <em>.tar.gz</em> files or
language specific archives such as <em>.gem</em> files. These archives are downloaded
from the internet before other packages are derived from them. Another large,
but less tightly packed region is the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. It dominates the
bottom of the graph and it is characterized by lots of smaller hub nodes
indicating that <em>pkg-config</em> organizes many packages that are important for
other packages. The ego network of <em>cmake</em> is mixed into a similar region of
the graph.</p>
<p>Python2.7 and Python3.6 form neat clusters with three central hub nodes that
correpond to the python interpreter, the package management tool <em>pip</em>, and the
build and installation tool <em>setuptools</em>. Python2.7 is used more often by
packages outside of its cluster than Python3.6. In contrast to Python, Perl has
only a single hub node for each specific version but it forms similarly dense
clusters. From the different Perl versions, <em>Perl-5.28.0</em> is reused most outside
of its own cluster by a lot of other packages in the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. This
indicates that the specific version of the Nixpkgs repository that I have
evaluated uses this particular Perl version as the default for other packages.</p>
<p>Lisp (sbcl), Haskell (ghc), Ruby, OCaml, Go, and Rust derivations also
accumulate in tight clusters around their respective compiler.</p>
<p>Ego networks can only give a glimpse into the structure of the graph of
Nixpkgs. Not all environments are organized around a central hub. Some packages
are self-contained and independent. For example, the Go
packages form a tight independent group because they <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26217488/what-is-vendoring">often include copies of third party packages that they depend on</a>.
There are also many smaller clusters that correspond to particular tools such
as terraform, maven or even the vim plugins. If you have time and patience, you
can try to find them in the labelled graph image above.</p>
<h2>The degree distribution of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Another perspective on the global properties of the Nixpkgs repository is the
degree distribution of its nodes. It shows how many nodes exist with a certain
in or out degree (as a reminder: the in degree is the number of packages that
depend on the node; the out degree is the number of packages that the node
depends on). Certainly there are a lot more nodes with low in degree than with
high in degree. More interesting is how the number of nodes with a
certain degree changes between the extremes.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of studies (for example
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have found that the in degree
distribution of software repository dependencies follows a power-law
distribution, similar to the degree distributions of networks in Geology,
Biology, Economics, or the Internet
(<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/courses/2006/cmplxsys899/powerlaws.pdf">here is a short introduction on power-laws</a>).
Such a power-law distribution can be generated by several mechanisms. The
hottest candidate mechanism in the case of software repositories seems to be
<em>preferential attachment</em>, a.k.a. “the rich get richer”. In other words, a new
package is more likely to depend on existing packages with a lot than on
packages with few dependencies. Other mechanisms such as <em>self-organized criticality</em>
<a href="https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/Downloads/ICSM-ICSME2007_EmpiricalEvidenceForSOCDynamicsInSoftwareEvolution.pdf">might also play a role</a>.</p>
<p>The (complementary) cumulative in and out degree distributions show how many
packages exist above a certain degree. Looking at the cumulative distribution
is typically better than looking at its derivative, the degree distribution. As
an integral, the cumulative distribution has a better behavior when the density
of packages gets low at high degrees. We plot it here for the in and
out degrees in log-log scale such that a power-law is just a straight line:</p>

<p>The cumulative in degree distribution is a very clean power-law decay with an
exponent of -0.9. The in degree distribution itself has an exponent of -1.9,

observe falls in the range of values that have been …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>© 2020 Paolo Melchiorre <i>"Photo of Paolo Melchiorre speaking at EuroPython 2020 Online Edition"</i></p><div>
<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at the EuroPython 2020 Online Edition with title <a href="https://www.paulox.net/2020/07/23/europython-2020/#europython-2020/">“A pythonic full-text search”</a> which is now available here on my&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p><em>In the last few years I gave a lot of talks in various tech conferences in Europe, but it was my first talk in an online conference, so I decided to share some thoughts about this&nbsp;experience.</em></p>
<p>The EuroPython team did a great job organizing everything. They made a list of tips and a complete guide for speakers that I suggest, to organizers and speakers of other conferences, to&nbsp;read.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/europython-2020-social-online-card.jpg" title="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020" alt="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020"></p>
<p>ep2020.europython.eu/events/tips/</p>

<p>Besides reading the guide and attending the rehearsal session, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to have a good setup. I copied from other conference speakers, and to have a working virtual background in zoom, I used my two external monitors as light&nbsp;panels.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-00.jpg"></p>
<p>Attending an online conference is a new experience , but giving a talk remotely is way more strange than in a regular conference. There’s nobody around to speak with, smiles at or asking to take a picture, so I shoot by myself some pictures of me during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-01.jpg"></p>
<p>At the same time, I was able to capture some screenshots of myself giving the talk from the live Youtube channel, so I have a picture of me from the other side of the screen in the exact moment of the above&nbsp;picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-02.png"></p>
<p>In the speakers guide there was this suggestion: “Throw in some jokes. Even bad jokes. Even a really bad pun.”. I tried to make a joke about synchronization problems in full-text search, a very dangerous thing to do, but here I’m laughing at my own joke during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-03.png"></p>
<p>Another suggestion from the organizers was to use “Pictures instead of bullet points in slides. Pictures are great. Everyone loves cats.” so I&nbsp;used:</p>
<ul>
<li>an elephant (the logo of&nbsp;PostgreSQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-04.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a famous guitaris (Django Reinhardt from whom the Django web framework takes its&nbsp;name)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-05.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>some&nbsp;books</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-07.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a picture of me at EuroPython 2017 during the sprint on&nbsp;Django</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-06.jpg"></p>
<p>In an online conference people are more interactive and free to do other things watching your talk, so I published in advance a post on my blog with the slides and other information about the talk, and I shared a <span>QR</span>-code linked to it and also all my other&nbsp;contacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-08.png"></p>
<p>Giving online talks is a stressful thing, but answering questions is way more difficult, you are not able to see who is asking the question and its expression. In these pictures I was at the end of the talk after a few questions, waiting for an&nbsp;applause.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-09.jpg"></p>
<p>This was my first time giving a talk in an online conference, it was a very challenging experience but I enjoyed it. I learnt a lot of new stuff, also how to take a picture of myself after the talk, to share it&nbsp;online.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-10.jpg"></p>
<p>I’ll gave other talks this year, I listed them on my talks&nbsp;page:</p>

<p><strong>See you at the next&nbsp;conference!</strong></p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a sense that time is running out. When I was in college, I felt like I only had a few years to make an impact on the world. Now that I’m 27, and my early 20s have turned into my late 20s, this sense of urgency has only accelerated.</p>

<h3 id="invictus">Invictus</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.</a> At least that’s what I tell myself. But life is comprised of both decisions that you make and other things that…just happen to you. The more I go through life, the more I realize that what happens to you has a greater impact than the decisions that you make. All we can try to do is shift the relative weights of that equation a little bit.</p>

<p>As a kid, I felt that the future was full of infinite possibilities. I had a million things to learn, books to read, places to travel, and experiences to rack up. I felt like I could be anything I wanted – a theoretical physicist, a musician, an athlete – if only I would dedicate myself to one pursuit.</p>

<p>I still feel like most of my life is ahead of me. But with each day that goes by, the universe of options that I have is quickly shrinking. Every day I decide to continue down my current path, countless other doors are closed off to me.</p>

<p>I started boxing last year. I really love it; it’s the first time I’ve felt dedicated to a sport since I played football in high school. But I will never be an elite boxer. That door has already closed. My athletic peak will probably occur in the next 5 years, if it hasn’t already. I could choose to train as hard as I could at boxing and devote myself to the sport, but even so, my ceiling would be a few amateur bouts. And the opportunity cost of going down that path is high.</p>

<p>You can’t have it all. Life is a series of tradeoffs. That truth, while simple, is hard to accept. It’s difficult to escape the feeling that your 20s is just a series of doors closing to you. Most people don’t even realize that those doors exist; their lives are lived by default. I wonder how much I fall into that camp. How much have I missed out on because I skated by on raw intelligence and didn’t challenge myself for the majority of my life?</p>

<p>When I was 10 years old, I thought that at this point in my life I’d be a pro athlete or a paleontologist. When I was 15, I thought that I’d be running a non-profit in Africa. When I was 20, I thought that I’d be a successful startup founder.</p>

<p>Now I fear that I’m not living up to my potential. By not diving deep into any one area, I’ve had an amazing breadth of experiences, but also worry that I’ve fallen victim to the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/">Optionality Trap</a>. Did I work hard enough over the past 10 years? Did I study the right things? Did I make the right choices?</p>

<p>There is so much I want to learn, experience, and accomplish in life. Despite my best efforts, I’ll only ever do a fraction of those. Life is short and I don’t have the time to do it all. I’m not sure if this feeling goes away with time, or if you just learn to live with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/mountain.jpg" alt="Man soul-searching on mountain"></p>

<h3 id="the-four-burners-theory">The Four Burners Theory</h3>
<p>James Clear talks about the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/four-burners-theory">Four Burners Theory</a>: there are tradeoffs among the different areas of your life. If your life is represented as a stove, every time you decide to invest time in one of the four burners – family, friends, health, and work – you necessarily lower the heat on your other burners. To be successful, you have to cut off one of your burners. To perform at an elite level, you need to cut off two.</p>

<p>I’ve felt this acutely. I’m trying to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perform well at work</li>
  <li>Get a <a href="https://cadena.coffee/">coffee roasting business</a> off of the ground</li>
  <li>Read and write regularly</li>
  <li>Be a good boyfriend, son, and brother</li>
  <li>Work out hard and reach my athletic potential</li>
  <li>Improve my technical skillset – I’m currently working on a few Coursera classes and have applied for a Masters program in Computer Science</li>
</ul>

<p>Many days, I feel like I’m barely treading water. By trying to do everything, I excel at nothing.</p>

<p>How to combat this? For me, it’s a combination of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introducing constraints</li>
  <li>Short-term immersion; long-term balance</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="introducing-constraints">Introducing Constraints</h3>
<p>I am not entirely happy with the final draft of this blog post. If I had worked on it for a few more hours, it would be better. But is the marginal benefit worth the marginal cost? (For those who don’t think in economic terms: Is the juice worth the squeeze?)</p>

<p>I’ve always been a procrastinator. I file an extension for my tax return every year. I’ve written every paper I was assigned in school the night before it was due. So I have tangibly experienced two truths:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Work will fill the time allotted for it (Parkinson’s Law).</li>
  <li>“Done” is always better than “perfect…but not yet launched”.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think often of the story of the clay pots, from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042JSQLU/">Art &amp; Fear</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/clay_pot.jpg" alt="Clay pot"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By time-boxing tasks and letting go of the pursuit of perfection, I can produce both a greater quantity <em>and quality</em> of work.</p>

<p>The overarching constraint in life is time. The clock is ticking: we will all die. Without this constraint, we wouldn’t have the motivation to do anything. Paradoxically, embracing constraints can lead to better long-term results.</p>

<h3 id="short-term-immersion-long-term-balance">Short-term Immersion; Long-term Balance</h3>
<p>I’ve found that intense learning over short periods of time is superior to casual learning over longer periods of time. I took Spanish from second grade through college, but I only improved dramatically when I studied abroad for a semester in Buenos Aires. Those first few weeks in Argentina, I struggled, but by pushing through the pain period I was able to become functionally fluent. Since then, my Spanish abilities have declined, but I can <a href="https://tim.blog/2007/09/20/how-to-resurrect-your-high-school-spanish-or-any-language-plus-be-on-the-cbs-early-show/">reactivate my Spanish</a> when necessary.</p>

<p>Likewise, to make substantial progress in any area of my life I need to get into a flow state, a period of obsession where all I’m thinking about is <a href="https://paranoidenough.com/">this blog</a> or <a href="https://cadena.coffee/">Cadena Coffee</a>. Today, I worked on this blog post and spent time with family. I didn’t make any progress in my health or work-related goals. That’s okay.</p>

<p>By diving deep and solely focusing on 1-2 burners for a burst of a week, month, or quarter, I can make drastic progress in those areas – progress that I wouldn’t be able to make in the same number of hours spread out over a period of time. So while my life may not have balance at any single point in time, over the long-run I can make progress in all of the areas that I care about.</p>

    <p>Getting stuck really sucks. It can be soul-crushing.</p>
<p>As developers, what do we do when we are stuck?
We have a process for code review, unit testing and deployment.</p>
<p>What is your process for when I get stuck though?</p>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/stuckcat.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@tomastuma?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>

<p>I ran into a really frustrating problem during my live stream and after <em>hours</em> of struggling with it I just had to call it a day.</p>
<p>Speaking with a friend that evening, they asked me how the stream had gone and I lamented my getting stuck.</p>
<p>Their response inspired me to write this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You stream to help people learn, right? Maybe watching a professional work through hard problems is more useful to your audience than seeing you do everything as if by magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were right.</p>
<p>The next day, instead of the previous feeling of dread at facing my own inadequacies, I felt inspired to build a strategy for when I was stuck, publish it, and ask for feedback and improvements from the broader development community.</p>
<p>So here we are. Please suggest additional steps in the comments!</p>

<p>This seems like the obvious place to start.</p>
<p>Collect everything you can about the issue and put it in a file. I use a simple markdown editor to take notes while I work or stream.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy the error</strong>
<br>
Copy <em>the exact</em> error into your file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read the error carefully</strong>
<br>
Like <em>actually</em> read it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigate and record the backtrace</strong>
<br>
If you have a backtrace, step through it and read the surrounding code. If anything looks suspicious, copy it into your file too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-read documentation</strong>
<br>
Go through any documentation around the code or tool in question.
Copy links or documentation into your file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Look for code examples</strong>
<br>
Search the documentation for relevant examples and stick them into your document as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-2-ask-google">Step 2: Ask Google</h2>
<p>You may be surpised that a Google search wasn’t step 1. Let’s be honest, you probably did a Google search before you even considered yourself <strong>“stuck”</strong>.</p>
<p>There is a reason this is step 2. Without the previous step (collecting information), you would be jumping into an ocean of information without arming yourself with some of your own.</p>
<p>Google is infamously good at solving programming problems, until when it isn’t. Then you’re really fucked. So do your research first. It’s too easy to get lost in pages of results otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Search the exact error</strong>
<br>
This should be your beginning point.
<br>
<code>Uncaught TypeError: fs.existsSync is not a function at getElectronPath</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add quotes in appropriate places</strong>
<br>
If you don’t know how to use quotes in Google searches,
<a href="http://www.googleguide.com/quote_operator.html">I’d suggest learning them here</a>.
You should look at which parts of the error should always be considered together.
<br>
<code>Uncaught TypeError: "fs.existsSync is not a function" at getElectronPath</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search the error without project-specific terms</strong>
<br>
Try and remove terms which are specific to your particular implementation. In the example, “uncaught” is probably not too relevant and <code>getElectronPath</code> may not be the only context which triggers the error. So let’s strip that out.
<br>
<code>TypeError: fs.existsSync is not a function</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search for “what you are trying to achieve” instead</strong>
<br>
Maybe you’re trying to do the thing you’re trying to do in the wrong way. This is a good way to sanity check.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if you find any possible solutions, record them in your document!</p>

<h2 id="step-3-ask-a-human-asynchronously">Step 3: Ask a Human Asynchronously</h2>
<p>Depending on your company culture, this step may come earlier or later.
I <strong>do</strong> think it’s important to ensure that you reach out asynchronously first.</p>
<p>I believe people should consider their colleagues’ time and attention to be the most precious resource in any organization.</p>
<p>This means Slack, Microsoft Teams or god forbid E-mail.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-reproduce-the-error-in-a-simplified-manner">Step 4: Reproduce the Error in a Simplified Manner</h2>
<p>This is a technique I often forget, but can prove invaluable in your quest for answers.</p>
<p>The basic idea is this: reduce the problem space.</p>
<p>This means either commenting out or removing parts of your system until you can’t remove anything else.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try and work in the opposite direction and try and <em>build</em> the minimum amount of surface area before you run into your issue. This strategy often means starting an entirely fresh project and rebuilding a tiny subsection of functionality in isolation.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/stackoverflow.jpg" alt="https://stackoverflow.com"></p>
<h2 id="step-5-stack-overflow">Step 5: Stack Overflow</h2>
<p>Stack Overflow doesn’t hold the highest reputation for friendliness, but this is usually because people who ask questions there have been lazy and not done the appropriate work to prepare their question.</p>
<p>That’s why you should <em>always</em> search for your question first. Be considerate.</p>
<p>Ask on Stack Overflow, but make sure to use your handy document (there was a reason to record all of this after all!) for reference. Post context, be descriptive, be polite.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-irc--gitter--reddit">Step 6: IRC / Gitter / Reddit</h2>
<p>Now we’re getting desperate.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you’ll often find that particular libraries and ecosystems have their own IRC channels. Yeah. IRC. Remember that?
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">Check out FreeNode IRC here.</a></p>
<p>Barring that, check out <a href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a>. If you’re not familiar, Gitter is a instant messaging platform that plugs into Github and other coding tools to build communities around particular software libraries.</p>
<p>If you get really desperate, try checking your programming language’s subreddit.
<a href="https://sebthecat.com/2020/07/reddit.com/r/javascript">For instance, here is the Javascript one.</a></p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://sebthecat.com/images/github.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/@lukechesser?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"></p>
<h2 id="step-7-github-issue">Step 7: GitHub (Issue)</h2>
<p>Okay. Maybe you’re not the problem. Maybe it’s a bug in <strong>someone else’s code</strong>. <strong>GASP</strong>. I know, you certainly didn’t think that before now right? ;)</p>
<p>So, let’s use the same principles of considerate detail that we used with Stack Overflow here.</p>
<p>Let’s create a GitHub issue. <strong>But before you do</strong>, re-read the documentation <em>again</em>.
And while you’re here, you may as well read the source code and look at more recent versions of the software that might already contain the fix you need!</p>
<p>Create a Git issue in the library you believe to be the cause.</p>
<p>Be polite and don’t assume they are wrong. You’re probably doing something stupid.
I’ve been doing this shit for over 2 decades and I do <em>incredibly</em> stupid things in my code almost hourly.</p>

<h2 id="step-8-can-we-do-it-better">Step 8: Can we do it better?</h2>
<p>Can you implement what you want to do in an <em>even</em> better way?</p>
<p>Stop. Think about it.</p>
<p>What if you could achieve what you’re trying to do without using this tool, or method, or class?
Could you do this thing in an <em>even better</em> way, that circumvents this whole problem entirely?</p>

<h2 id="step-9-can-we-get-it-working-worse">Step 9: Can we get it working, worse?</h2>
<p>We’re getting to the end of our metaphorical tether. Okay. Deep breath.</p>
<p>What could we do to get this working “quick and dirty”?</p>
<p>What that be enough? Is there a “lo-fi” or “low-tech” solution here that allows us to dodge this issue?</p>

<h2 id="step-10-rubber-ducking">Step 10: Rubber Ducking</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">The ancient Chinese art of “Rubber Ducking”</a>.</p>
<p>This is a technique where you talk to an inanimate object like a lunatic. It actually works.
Go find some private place (unless you already have a reputation for psychotic breaks).</p>
<p>Speak through your problem out loud. Externalizing the problem usually helps us approach it from a new perspective.</p>

<h2 id="step-11-ask-a-colleague-synchronously">Step 11: Ask a Colleague Synchronously</h2>
<p>Okay, by now your colleague should have responded to your earlier request. If they haven’t, they are ignoring you because they can detect your terror.</p>
<p>At this point you have my permission to interupt their ass. If they complain, send them my way. Really. I could use the publicity.</p>
<p><strong>Pair on the problem.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t just ask them questions. Get them looking at the code. Run them through it.</p>
<p>Your goal here <strong>is not to share your pain</strong>, it’s to <strong>share your understanding of the problem</strong>. Remember this.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, show them the massive document you’ve prepared with everything you’ve found out and tried.</p>

<h2 id="the-endgame">The Endgame</h2>
<p>When you find your solution don’t just forget the process and dump all of your good work.</p>
<p>You’ll probably encounter this problem again, and if you won’t, someone else will.</p>
<p>Take your notes and write them up. Post them on your company’s development wiki. Even better, post them on a blog somewhere. Share the love brah. Please!</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was just what I came up with.</p>
<p>If you have any recommendations… additional steps, reordering or improvements <strong>please comment</strong>!
I’d love to add to this. :) Getting stuck <em>really sucks</em>. It can be soul-crushing.</p>
<p>So. Share the love. &lt;3</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                
    <span>Jul 2020</span>

    

    <p>Letâ€™s just skip the intro and get to the good stuff. Mmkay? Kay.</p>
<h2>1) Move â€œFind Allâ€� To The Bottom</h2>
<p>When you hit <em>Cmd+Shift+F</em> VS Codeâ€™s â€œFind Allâ€� panel shows up.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a super powerful feature. Itâ€™s one of the niceties that originally drew me away from Sublime Text in the first place.</p>
<p>WHY IN THE WORLD IS IT SCRUNCHED IN THE SIDEBAR!!??!</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1470600526.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The bottom panel thingy (where the terminal sits) is a much better place for â€œSearchâ€�.</p>
<p>This actually used to be the default in VS Code, and there was a setting to customize it yourself.</p>
<p>Now, they changed the default AND they removed the setting completely.</p>
<p>What are we to do?</p>
<p>Welp, turns out you can just drag it. Take a gander:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1353159485.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There we go. One annoyance down. Four to go.</p>
<h2>2) Better New Window Sizing</h2>
<p>This one might just be me, but when I open a new VS Code window, I expect it to be the same size as the previously opened one.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window in VS Code looks like with an existing window already opened by default:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3312027563.png" alt="">
Now, admittedly, this actually looks kind of cool, but nonetheless, it would make so much more sense if VS Code just used the last known window size as a reference.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we can add the following configuration to our <em>settings.json</em> file.</p>
<p>To open <em>settings.json</em>, search for â€œsettings jsonâ€� in the command palette (<em>Cmd+Shift+P</em>):
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3815150.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, you can add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "inherit",</code></pre>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window will look like now:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3355376318.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You might also prefer to keep the same dimensions, but â€œoffsetâ€� the new window. You can do that with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "offset",</code></pre>
<p>Now, the new window will be â€œoffsetâ€�:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/32369233.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3) Snippet Suggestions At The Top</h2>
<p>Snippets in VS Code are a powerful way to auto-fill repetitive boilerplate text. If you donâ€™t already use them, you can read more about them <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">here</a>.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know about you, but if I registered a trigger for a snippet, I want to see that snippet at the top of my autocomplete list. Otherwise, SNIPPETS ARE USELESS.</p>
<p>Snippets have to be fast and easy to trigger, and out of the box THEY ARE NOT.</p>
<p>Take the following example GIF of a <code>console.log</code> snippet with a trigger of <code>con</code>.</p>
<p>When I type <code>con</code> I should be able to hit <em>Enter</em> and fill <code>console.log</code>.
This is not the case: </p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2858044731.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>To remedy this, we can add a new setting to our <em>settings.json</em> file:</p>
<pre><code>"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top",</code></pre>
<p>Now, when I type <code>con</code>, my suggestions are more sensible:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/4146687846.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh, VS Codeâ€¦</p>
<h2>4) GitHub-Style Inline Diffs</h2>
<p>I LOVE VS Codeâ€™s diff viewer.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a great way to get a glimpse of your changes before a commit, or easily resolve a merge conflict.</p>
<p>However, the default diff viewer is â€œSide by Sideâ€�. Meaning there are two panels with two different versions of the same file open side by side:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/595731340.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I much prefer the way GitHub renders diffs inline:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1762674115.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can easily achieve this in VS Code with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"diffEditor.renderSideBySide": false,</code></pre>
<p>Now take a look at the diff editor in VS Code:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2616479419.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wehoo, love it ðŸ‘ŒðŸ�»</p>
<h2>5) Disable â€œPeekâ€� Previews</h2>
<p>Previews panels in VS Code are the most annoying thing ever.</p>
<p>So ugly and so useless.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever wanted to see a tiny preview of a file instead of just viewing the file itself. The previews are always too constrained anyways.</p>
<p>Look at this horribleness:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/597353947.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With a few settings we can improve our world and never see those disgusting things again!</p>
<pre><code>"editor.gotoLocation.multipleReferences": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDefinitions": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDeclarations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleTypeDefinitions": "goto",</code></pre>
<p>Ah, there we go, now we will actually go to the file itself right away. Much better.</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1392694127.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>VS Code has so many powerful features. Iâ€™m a happy user of it. However, there are lots of tiny little details it gets wrong.</p>
<p>If you dig these short little tips, I have an entire course FULL of them.</p>
<p>In the course, weâ€™ll completely overhaul your VS Code workflow and make you fast and efficient. Along the way weâ€™ll also make VS Code look and behave better.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>These days I turn to <a href="https://sharpend.io/recreational-programming-with-serverless/">recreational programming</a> more often than usual. Solving fun problems makes me feel less confused and helpless about the pandemic. It’s a coping mechanism and a good one at that.</p>

<p>One thing has been an especially surprising source of joy for me: <em>Rust</em>. Surprising because I’ve been known to have an on-off relationship with the programming language since its 1.0 release. I quit Rust more than once – both professionally and personally – mainly out of frustration with a subpar development experience and general lack of libraries.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’m thrilled that I gave Rust another chance this year.</p>

<h2 id="that-was-then">That was then</h2>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://sharpend.io/every-day-we-must-sweep/">I wrote</a> that “Rust lets you control almost everything, but as a beginner, it’s also hard to compile <em>anything</em>. As a result, Rust continues to make me look bad.” I was disappointed. Again.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working for a chaos engineering startup that chose Rust for simulating common server problems such as high CPU load, increased network latency, or random application crashes. A reasonable choice if your goal is to inject low-level faults in a predictable way, right? After all, Rust is said to be <a href="https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/">our best chance at safe systems programming</a>. That may very well be true.</p>

<p>However, back then, I didn’t think Rust was the best option for the client side of the product. The main reason was productivity – or rather the lack thereof.</p>

<p>In 2017, my day-to-day Rust experience boiled down to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing code in Vim with bare-bones syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>No code completion and no “go to definition” (the Rust Language Server was still in its infancy)</li>
  <li>Effectively no code formatting, since <code>rustfmt</code> just gave up whenever a line was too long (seriously)</li>
  <li>Docs were hard to find or non-existent</li>
  <li>The same goes for high-quality code examples</li>
  <li>No official Rust Docker images, homegrown CI pipelines only</li>
  <li>Compile times were noticeably slow, resulting in long <a href="https://sharpend.io/fast-feedback-is-everything/">feedback loops</a></li>
  <li>Speaking of feedback, Rust’s borrow checker made it difficult to understand why it rejected a piece of code and how to fix it</li>
</ul>

<p>All these drawbacks add up, but what really bothered me was the immature crate ecosystem. To give you one example, when we implemented the ability to inject faults into containers, we couldn’t find any usable Rust client library to talk to the Docker API, let alone Kubernetes. As a result, we were forced to reinvent the wheel several times (and sometimes ended up with a flat tire, in typical startup fashion).</p>

<p>In the face of these obstacles and despite my appreciation for its language design, I often found it challenging to get real work done with Rust.</p>

<p>At least, that was then.</p>

<p><img src="https://sharpend.io/assets/images/rust-gegenueber.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="this-is-now">This is now</h2>

<p>Today, three years later, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/05/15/five-years-of-rust.html">Rust has changed a lot</a>, and for the better! That became apparent to me when I recently had some extra time between freelance contracts and decided to <a href="https://sharpend.io/7-things-i-learned-from-porting-a-c-crypto-library-to-rust/">port a crypto library from C to Rust</a> (because that’s what I do to get out of the cloud consulting bubble once in a while).</p>

<p>I realized that the release of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html">2018 edition</a> is particularly noteworthy. It made the language much more productive in several ways: simpler syntax, a smarter borrow-checker, an improved module system, enhanced tooling (both <code>rustfmt</code> and Clippy, Rust’s linter, hitting 1.0), and a host of other features. Add to that IDE support, incremental compilation, excellent documentation, and immensely helpful error messages, and what you now get is nothing short of remarkable.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rust’s soaring popularity – it has been <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow’s most loved language</a> for four years in a row – finding a particular crate or tool has become easier (though still not necessarily easy). There are more and more <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">open source projects</a> to explore. There’s a growing list of third-party cargo subcommands (<a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-geiger">cargo-geiger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm">cargo-asm</a> being two of my favorites). There’s even <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">a decent REPL</a>. CI/CD <a href="https://actions-rs.github.io/">is a breeze</a>, and so is <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">cross compilation</a> to dozens of platforms. In short, there’s a lot to love here.</p>

<p>Given these advances, it’s no wonder that learning Rust is also quite different now. The tonari blog <a href="https://blog.tonari.no/why-we-love-rust">captured it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year after switching over to Rust, we onboarded our fourth engineer to the team, who didn’t have much prior experience in either Rust or systems engineering. While the learning curve is undeniable (borrow checker, my old friend), we’ve found that Rust is incredibly empowering for those new to lower-level programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Empowering</em> is the perfect word to describe Rust in 2020. What used to be a rough adventure with many pitfalls has turned into something beautiful, something that can lift your spirit. At least, that’s what it did for me.</p>

<p>I encourage you to immerse yourself in a little Rust project today. You might be in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Howdy there, and welcome to the wild web rodeo! As always, we’re riding in an effort to become better frontend developers. This week we’re taking a developer’s glance at Figma, a spectacular design tool.</p><p>As a frontend designer we’re dealing with design on a daily basis, and being comfortable with Figma opens up so many possibilities. By learning a bit of Figma you could:</p><ul><li>Handle small design tasks at work</li><li>Mock up a personal website or side project</li><li>Make blog post images</li><li>Create share images for Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram</li><li>Create logos</li><li>Meme coworkers (at your own risk)</li></ul><p>If you don’t consider yourself a designer, don’t worry! This issue is written <strong>for web developers</strong>, so I’ll be using terms we’re familiar with. I won’t waste your time with things that are only useful for designers.</p><h4 id="why-figma"><a href="#why-figma" aria-label="why figma permalink"></a>Why Figma?</h4><p>Why <em>this</em> design tool over all the others? Figma has a ton of features and perks, but these are the big ones:</p><ul><li>Cross platform &amp; web based</li><li>Free (except for medium to big companies)</li><li>Live collaboration</li><li>Version control &amp; single source of truth</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: I have no association with Figma and they did not pay for any part of this newsletter. I just think it’s a super useful tool for web developers.</p><h4 id="our-resident-expert"><a href="#our-resident-expert" aria-label="our resident expert permalink"></a>Our Resident Expert</h4><p>I’m by no means a Figma expert, so I reached out to someone who knows much more than me, <a href="https://ryan.warner.codes/">Ryan Warner</a>. Ryan is a software engineer and interface designer, and has put up with more of my Figma questions than I’d like to admit.</p><p>There’s one problem when you come into a field like design and a new tool like Figma: <em>What should I learn? What’s going to provide the most value for me?</em></p><p>I asked Ryan to give us the <strong>few Figma skills</strong> that would give developers the <strong>greatest rewards</strong>. That’s what we’ll be learning today, so let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="multiplayer-collaboration"><a href="#multiplayer-collaboration" aria-label="multiplayer collaboration permalink"></a>Multiplayer Collaboration</h2><p>One key aspect of Figma is that the files don’t live on your desktop, but instead in the cloud. Whenever you make a change, everyone with access to the file can see it in real time. I asked Ryan what the biggest benefit was for cloud-based design:</p><blockquote><p>Enabling team communication is the biggest benefit. It has never been easier for developers to be included in the design process from the beginning. Gone are the days of passing around files in Slack or Dropbox and asking questions or commenting on designs in disparate locations. With Figma, anyone can start a discussion about a specific part of a design that is open and available for the whole team to see.</p></blockquote><p>Ryan touches on a lot here. Let’s break down each point.</p><h4 id="early-involvement"><a href="#early-involvement" aria-label="early involvement permalink"></a>Early Involvement</h4><p><strong>Getting developers involved early on and throughout the design phase can save a team from headaches later on.</strong> The nature of Figma encourages this kind of collaboration, where developers, project managers, and other stakeholders can be involved from the jump.</p><h4 id="comments-and-discussions"><a href="#comments-and-discussions" aria-label="comments and discussions permalink"></a>Comments and Discussions</h4><p>The comment feature in Figma lets conversations happen alongside designs. You can create a thread, tag users, and have open discussions that involve the whole team.</p><h4 id="pair-designing"><a href="#pair-designing" aria-label="pair designing permalink"></a>Pair Designing</h4><p>If there’s one killer feature for Figma, it’s being able to work together in real time. Similar to Google Docs, you can see who has the file open and what they’re working on. Click on their name and you get to see what they’re seeing and follow their mouse.</p><p>Ryan says:</p><blockquote><p>Pair designing is another huge reason I love Figma and the multiplayer feature. My teammates and I can be working together in the same file in real time.</p></blockquote><p>In a time where so many people are working remotely, the feeling of designing alongside someone is more important then ever.</p><h4 id="side-projects"><a href="#side-projects" aria-label="side projects permalink"></a>Side Projects</h4><p>I designed a website for <a href="https://www.newhaven.io/">my local tech meetup</a>, and it was great to have my collaborators jump into the Figma file and suggest changes and improvements. Pair designing and live feedback made the project more fun and the result much better.</p><p>I also made all the designs and images for Frontend Horse in Figma. It allows me to ask friends for feedback on designs as I’m making them.</p><p>Figma is the perfect tool for side projects. There’s zero cash investment, and you can learn new skills without the pressure that a job typically brings.</p><h2 id="github-for-design"><a href="#github-for-design" aria-label="github for design permalink"></a>GitHub for Design</h2><p>I think of Figma as design’s GitHub. It’s not a <em>perfect</em> analogy but hear me out.</p><h4 id="version-control"><a href="#version-control" aria-label="version control permalink"></a>Version Control</h4><p>Figma has version control, both through autosaves and optional manual save points. You can roll back to a previous version, and see who made what changes, just like with git.</p><h4 id="single-source-of-truth"><a href="#single-source-of-truth" aria-label="single source of truth permalink"></a>Single Source of Truth</h4><p>Just like a shared repository, you’ve got a single source of truth. Even if visual ‘merge conflicts’ arise, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">Figma will intelligently diff changes in real time</a>. You always know that you’re looking at the latest designs.</p><p>Figma also has a new community feature that allows for Figma files to be published similar to public repos. <a href="https://www.figma.com/@RyanWarner">Check out Ryan’s community page</a>:</p><p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p><p>Like looking through a GitHub repo, I can check out the files Ryan decided to share with the community: some <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/820337605519256142">Social Branding Templates</a>, and the design mocks for <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/824810955262478067">his personal site</a>.</p><p>Like forking a repo, you can “Duplicate” any community file, and now you can edit your own version however you wish.</p><p>The best part? You don’t need to use any commands like with git. It all just works.</p><p>Just like Ryan’s Social Branding Templates, there are tons of other free resources open to the community. There’s wireframe kits, Storybook add ons, iPhone mockups, and lots more. <a href="https://www.figma.com/resources/">Check it out</a>.</p><h2 id="components-and-systems"><a href="#components-and-systems" aria-label="components and systems permalink"></a>Components and Systems</h2><p>Figma takes a few great ideas from modern web development like components, color variables, text styles, and design systems. Getting the hang of these is so helpful for working on your own or with designers.</p><h4 id="components"><a href="#components" aria-label="components permalink"></a>Components</h4><p>In web development we often use components to build larger things from smaller pieces. Those small pieces, like buttons, can be reused throughout the site over and over. If the button needs to be changed, you only need to change it in one place, not in every place it’s used throughout the project.</p><p>Figma has components, and it works in much the same way. You can create a button component, and then every clone you make of that button will become a duplicate of the original.</p><p><span>

  <img alt="component-main-instance.png" title="component-main-instance.png" src="https://frontend.horse/static/0297bd851f0d5b51fc1ee8e868b506db/2bef9/component-main-instance.png" srcset="https://frontend.horse/static/0297bd851f0d5b51fc1ee8e868b506db/6f3f2/component-main-instance.png 256w,https://frontend.horse/static/0297bd851f0d5b51fc1ee8e868b506db/01e7c/component-main-instance.png 512w,https://frontend.horse/static/0297bd851f0d5b51fc1ee8e868b506db/2bef9/component-main-instance.png 1024w,https://frontend.horse/static/0297bd851f0d5b51fc1ee8e868b506db/c1b63/component-main-instance.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p><p>The original is called the “Main” component, and all duplicates become “Instances.” Any changes to the Main affects the instances, but changes to the instances don’t affect the main.</p><p>This button component can be nested inside other components, just like how you might build a React or Vue app.</p><p>With a few components you can make designing in Figma easier and more consistent.</p><h4 id="color-styles"><a href="#color-styles" aria-label="color styles permalink"></a>Color Styles</h4><p>On the web, it’s common to define colors as variables with SCSS or CSS custom properties. We can do the same in Figma with “Color Styles.”</p><h4 id="text-styles"><a href="#text-styles" aria-label="text styles permalink"></a>Text Styles</h4><p>Text styles in Figma allow you to define typographic properties like for headings, body text, button labels, and whatever else you want. Define the font, weight, size, line height, and kerning.</p><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039820134-Manage-and-share-Styles">Learn more about working with styles</a>.</p><h4 id="design-system-example"><a href="#design-system-example" aria-label="design system example permalink"></a>Design System Example</h4><p>I mentioned that Ryan has shared his personal site’s Figma file with the community, but I didn’t mention that he has a style guide included in it.</p><p><span>

But as Ryan will tell us, making a style guide isn’t the place you should start.</p><h2 id="to-improve-design-skills-start-small"><a href="#to-improve-design-skills-start-small" aria-label="to improve design skills start small permalink"></a>To Improve Design Skills, Start Small</h2><p>If you feel like your design skills are limited, Ryan has some great advice.</p><blockquote><p>You don’t need to be a great designer to start visually communicating your ideas. My advice for anyone interested in getting better at design is to open Figma and start putting things on the screen. Don’t worry about it looking good. Don’t worry about your color palette or style guides. Draw some rectangles, type some text, and start externalizing your ideas. The rest will come with time.</p></blockquote><p>Ryan’s right. Just starting with <em>anything</em> is better than nothing. You’ve gotta trot before you gallop.</p><p>When starting a design, keep it black and white. It’ll stop you from spending hours picking the <em>perfect</em> shade of blue before you’ve actually designed anything.</p><p>Get your ideas on the screen first, then work to add polish to them. The first version will be bad, the second a bit better. You see where I’m going with this.</p><p>If you’re interested in design tips for developers let me know and we can cover it specifically in a future issue!</p><h2 id="from-comps-to-code"><a href="#from-comps-to-code" aria-label="from comps to code permalink"></a>From Comps to Code</h2><p>As a developer we’re often tasked with turning design comps or layouts into actual HTML and CSS. I asked Ryan  <strong>what’s the best way to turn Figma designs into code? Does Figma make the design to dev pipeline easier?</strong></p><blockquote><p>There’s no single best way, but Figma does set us (developers) up for success. Most of the styling tools in Figma map intuitively to CSS. For example, the values for drop shadows map 1-to-1 to CSS box-shadow, x, y, blur, and color. Figma even has a code tab that generates CSS you can copy and paste into your code editor.</p></blockquote><p>The code tab makes going from design mocks to code a lot easier, but there are a couple things to watch out for. Let’s just use this square and its code output as an example.</p><p><span>
      <a href="https://frontend.horse/static/ae2721c8eb959abef231f445a7f47324/92e00/code-example.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p><p>The positioning values you’re given are often useless unless you’re using some of Figma’s advanced layout features.</p><p>I’m using my brand Color Styles on this square, so when I export the code, it adds comments for “Peach” and “Eggplant” above the colors. That helps me swap those out with SCSS variables or something similar when I bring it into my code.</p><h4 id="measuring-and-spacing"><a href="#measuring-and-spacing" aria-label="measuring and spacing permalink"></a>Measuring and Spacing</h4><p>The above CSS is great for styling that individual element, but often you need to know how far components are from one another. With one object selected, hold <code>alt</code> and mouse over other objects to find out how far apart they are. Mousing over the frame shows the distance from the edges.</p><p>This one key will help you with a lot of your layout CSS.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been a global shift toward data-driven business. But, in many cases, the data just under the surface is dirty, and it’s failing modern companies.</p><p>In their<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/white-papers/2020-global-data-management-research.pdf"> <em>2020 Global data management research</em></a> report, Experian estimated that many businesses aiming for agile, data-driven approaches believe almost a third of their data to be inaccurate.</p><blockquote><em>“While the business wants to be agile and informed by data, this level of distrusted data often leads leaders to fall back on making decisions by gut instinct rather than by informed data insight.” Experian Global Managing Director of Data Quality Mike Kilander</em></blockquote><p>That doesn’t just mean a large chunk of the data the companies have isn’t working for them. It means their data is working <em>against </em>them—costing them money, frustrating their employees, and getting in the way of opportunities.</p><p>If you don’t take an active role in your data governance, your dirty data will snowball, picking up crud as it rolls forward. If left uncleaned, it can tarnish up to<a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64612-the-cost-of-bad-data-stats"> 70% of your data after one year</a>. This data erosion will directly impact your bottom line--as it does for<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 83% of companies</a>--and cost you an average of<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 23% of your revenue</a>.</p><p>Mature data governance is no longer a wish list item for modern companies. It’s table stakes, so much so that, according to the<a href="https://go.profisee.com/2019-state-of-data-management-report"> 2019 State of Data Management Report</a>, governance is one of the top five strategic initiatives for global companies.</p><p>To stop throwing your time and money out the window and make your data clean up and grow up, you need a mature, enterprise-wide data governance model.</p><p>These maturity models help companies ensure the data in their system is accurate, well understood, and supported by employees with the skill sets needed to turn numbers into narrative.</p><h2><strong>What Exactly Is Data Governance Maturity and Why Should You Care?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity refers to the level of data management process and optimization you have built into your business.</p><p>At a company with mature data governance, clean and formal data management is at the core of everything they do. Each employee, team lead, and department knows the best practices they’re supposed to follow, and the company’s projects are regularly measured and optimized using the data produced. This gold standard of a data-driven company actively optimizes its processes using the <strong>three main components of data governance:</strong></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Rules </strong>that dictate the creation and maintenance of data</li><li><strong>Enforcement </strong>that outlines how you ensure rules are followed throughout the company</li><li><strong>Management </strong>practices that are carried out by data stewards and employees in accordance with enforcement</li></ol><p>In its infancy, data governance maturity looks like reactive data management, ad-hoc data practices, a lack of formally defined best practices, and a kind of free-for-all approach to how data is collected, cleaned, and pruned. In short: it looks like chaos, where data is a byproduct of your company instead of the fuel behind its actions.</p><p>If you aren’t taking a proactive role in your data governance by measuring its maturity, you’re letting an information toddler run through an operational china shop—a dirty-data toddler that can wreck your company, leaving errors, inconsistencies, and security risks in its path.</p><p><em>“Poor data is often entangling entire organizations with crippling effects, preventing timely decision-making and negatively impacting customer experience.” — Experian 2020 Global data management research report</em></p><p>However, there’s no “one size fits all” approach to data governance, so you’ll have to work with your leaders and systems architects to tailor the framework that fits your use case and goals.</p><h2><strong>Which Data Governance Maturity Models Should You Use?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity models help you measure and understand how well you manage your data. When you have a clear understanding of your data governance, you’re better able to understand how you are or are not meeting goals, what steps you need to take to improve data management overall, and how you need to tailor data approaches to each team and project.</p><p>There are almost as many data governance maturity models as there are use cases for data. If you already use a maturity model to measure your data capabilities, it’s best to adjust that framework and apply it to your data governance to keep things consistent.</p><p>If, however, you’re starting from the ground level, you can choose from one of the many maturity assessments published by reputable vendors, each of which features a slightly different emphasis:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ii/whitepaper/LIW14003USEN.pdf"><strong>IBM</strong></a><strong> &amp;</strong><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/bg/en/pages/technology/articles/Data-management-maturity-self-assessment.html"><strong> Deloitte</strong></a> focus on process characterization across projects and enterprise levels and use the CMMI Institute’s Data Management Maturity (DMM) model.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-dataflux/"><strong>DataFlux</strong></a> focuses on people, risk, process, reward, technology adoption, and business capabilities.</li><li><a href="https://dattamza.org/dattamza-blog/data-governance-and-the-maturity-assessment-model"><strong>Dattamza</strong></a> focuses on process, technology capabilities, managed risk, financials, and people management.</li><li><a href="https://edmcouncil.org/page/aboutdcamreview"><strong>EDM Council</strong></a> focuses on the maturity of an organization’s structure, its policies and guidelines, and funding.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-kalido/"><strong>Kalido</strong></a><strong> </strong>focuses on the value of data as an enterprise asset and the risks and rewards of how it’s managed.</li></ul><p>All of the above feature some version of the level 1-5 system to rate the development stage of a company’s data governance.</p><p>For this article, we’ll focus on the IBM model, as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework that underpins it is one of the most popular—and oldest—ways of thinking about data governance maturity.</p><p>The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) was developed in 2006 by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University based on the earlier Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The CMM was originally developed to improve software dev processes, and its successor took its original principles and made them more broadly applicable to any enterprise using data.</p><h2><strong>IBM Data Governance Maturity Model</strong></h2><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model is one of the most widely used models around for measuring the maturity of data governance. Drawing from the creation of the CMMI in 2006, IBM released this model in 2007 to provide a clear, easy-to-understand, and tailored framework for measuring data maturity.</p><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model focuses on measuring 11 domains—such as value creation, policy, stewardship, information lifecycle management, and data architecture—using a maturity scale of 1-5. Most companies start out by focusing on the handful that are most relevant and important to them and then building out as their core domains become more mature.</p><h3><strong>The 5 levels of maturity</strong></h3><p>For each domain a company focuses on, the IBM Data Governance Maturity Model outlines five levels of maturity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f0630497ff87413654faabe_T2hZFW0T8EQNecms1z_IAs21zOeWR0GH86WjVAcxXzg-5mPW3etCgX8mjOkAIZGTVKtdKlIbEwbztZ2aF1lXTEDJcd_dMEwru420NjwMZ1UaX4iU1uOXYPHzNJLBv_GgN255gqOL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Below, we’ll take a look at what exactly maturity at each level means and how you can level up to the next stage based on your current data governance practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 1: Initial</strong></h3><p>Companies with level 1 data governance have little to no data management processes in place, are reactive to data management, and have no formalized tracking plan.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: In order to move beyond level 1, system architects should audit information flow and develop a plan for managing it with stakeholders and IT managers.</p><h3><strong>Level 2: Managed</strong></h3><p>Companies that achieve level 2 data governance have slightly more processes in place, some automation integrated, and more awareness of data. This is where most companies start their data governance journey.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: To upgrade your data governance maturity to level 3, focus on developing data regulation and documentation guidelines. Your system architects should begin to do this by building models of core infrastructure and documentation needs.</p><h3><strong>Level 3: Defined</strong></h3><p>Level 3 data governance means that there are some defined policies in place, you’re regularly leveraging technology for data management, you’ve developed a road map for integrating data, and best practices are more widely understood across the company.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel: </strong>As you move into level 4, continue to implement data stewardship by assigning and implementing policies and rules of data management. This policy framework will underpin regular risk assessments and help you create a central program for educating teams on data best practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 4: Quantitatively Managed</strong></h3><p>By level 4, your company should have a clear, enterprise-wide data governance structure with projects that follow your set rules and principles and models that are well documented and regularly reviewed. You should have a well-defined policy framework that outlines frequent risk assessments and methods for educating enterprise teams on the company’s data management best practices.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: Now that your framework has been created and implemented, focus on defining and setting performance measurement metrics for each process. To do this, create a plan for maintaining data models and check that each project follows your data best practices to avoid dirtying data down the line.</p><h3><strong>Level 5: Optimizing</strong></h3><p>Level 5 is the holy grail of data governance. 🏆 At this point, data governance should be streamlined, and processes should be automated. Data governance is at the core of how you do business.</p><p>This means that data governance is no longer an afterthought or detour on the way to how you do business. Instead, all teams and employees should know how to follow data best practices, and every project you do should follow these rules and principles to create and utilize clean data.</p><p>Since this is the ultimate level of data governance, there is no upleveling from here. Instead, if you reach level 5, focus on continuously measuring and analyzing ROI for all projects, so you keep your data integrity.</p><h2><strong>Make Better Decisions with Better Data</strong></h2><p>Your data governance is only as mature as the data underneath it is good. To become truly data-driven, you must ensure you have a single, high-quality source of truth to work with.</p><p>Avo helps you create this single source of truth and make the right data-driven decisions to move your business by allowing you to prioritize, inspect, analyze, and future-proof your tracking to create reliable data now …</p></div></div>

But its multiple components have been around for a while. Thing is that it took a while for business to realize they needed more than just a marketer and a UX designer to ramp up their marketing outcomes.</p><p>Specifically, companies noticed an increased need for professionals who were able to successfully juggle marketing, creativity-based tasks, data science, and even coding.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because these professionals understand the business market in its entirety. We’re talking UX designers who can see the value behind marketing and digital marketers who realize that data science and AI can only aid their projects and campaigns. No more award-winning website designs that can’t bring in leads or loads of data rusting in your archives because you don’t know how to use it.</p><p>For this reason, growth means different things to different companies and is present in multiple departments. If you will, growth hacking should be the overarching guiding force of all your business attempts.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="89df34e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>But if growth hacking implies so many things, does this mean a growth hacker does everything?</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>I’ve analyzed over 200 recent listings on Glassdoor to see what the current expectations for this role are.</p><p><strong>Here are the top responsibilities of a growth hacker:</strong></p><ul><li>Own, define, and lead strategies for growing the user base</li><li>Measure the effectiveness of user growth initiatives and track KPIs/core metrics for all campaigns and communication strategies</li><li>Improve customer funnels</li><li>Find and create opportunities for organic and paid customer acquisition</li><li>Make recommendations for new product, pricing, and packaging strategies to improve UX</li><li>Be in charge of market research to establish new social media opportunities and analyze competitiveness</li><li>Conduct user research and define/refine the user profiles and personas</li><li>Implement and track A/B testing</li><li>Build valuable marketing strategies with the purpose of acquiring new customers through both online and offline channels</li><li>Communicate with the other teams to exchange ideas and make recommendations based on your own research</li><li>Manage budgets for different marketing channels and track ROI</li><li>Keep up with the latest changes in marketing and UI/UX as well as other industry trends and news</li><li>Initiate new projects to attract prospects, convert them into leads, and close sales</li></ul><p><br>These responsibilities will differ from one company to another.</p><p>In smaller teams, growth hackers can partially take over the duties of missing team members to help with someone else’s workload. This means you’ll also see them in charge of other tasks such as content writing, customer communication, and even sales from time to time. But overall, creativity and problem solving are the two main traits that define a growth hacker.</p></div></div></div><section data-id="7d7095e" data-element_type="section" data-settings="{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}"><div><div><div data-id="96fbefb" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="a719b8d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to download</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><div data-id="ebe7b57" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Getting Started With Growth Hacking<br></h2></p></div><div data-id="ace5e86" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Before you jump into A/B testing and adding dozens of pop-ups on your website, you need to clearly think this through and establish what growth means to you.</p><p>For some companies, growth is strictly a matter of marketing, others get all of their teams involved, bringing in UX, support, sales, and development into the whole growth hacking picture.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="365d954" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Researching and defining your goals</h3></p></div><div data-id="d187796" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>I know a marketing audit doesn’t sound like the funnest part of growth hacking, but it’s certainly the healthiest first thing you can do. <br>If you’re just getting started, a full market analysis and customer research will do.</p><p>Already been around for a while?

The ultimate growth hack is to have phone or video calls with customers, hear what they think, and use their phrases and words in your sales and marketing copy. When customers speak to you, you’ll also notice common trends and pain points you can later aim to solve.</p><p>Customers will explain these with much of the same language. This might be because they all encounter the same problems, come from a similar area, hail from the same socioeconomic background, or are used to a particular industry. Once you collect their language, take note of what broad swaths of customers are saying. Map it out on a spreadsheet and use that info on your marketing and sales copy.

Growth hackers though have a main target they want to achieve and can even obsess around. Usually this goal is either bringing in new users/customers or increasing sales.</p><p>Having a growth hacker on your team at this point already helps you leverage their research and analytical skills. Particularly when it comes to prioritizing your goals.</p><p>This is important because, with so many things that need to be tweaked and tested, you simply won’t know where to start.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="ed3c59a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Setting your key metrics according to your funnel channels</h3></p></div><div data-id="991e876" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>At this point, you’ll also want to establish the majority of the metrics you need to track.

The goal of OKRs is to enable the team to make the right decisions for the business in a vacuum. When done poorly, your team may lack focus, work on non-impactful projects, or not know how they’re contributing to business goals. When done well, your team will say “no” effectively and can put more effort into impactful projects.

All you have to do is find the relevant websites and tactics to be present on based on your ideal audience.</p><p>Let’s say you’re selling a book on software development. Clearly your efforts shouldn’t go into promoting it in fashion groups or even marketing websites. You need to BE where developers are, SPEAK their language, and MEET their needs.</p><p>If you’ve been sharing your content left and right without analyzing the platform you’re putting yourself on, stop right now. This can be largely detrimental to your image [plus spam score 🙄] and bring no real value.</p><h4><span><strong><br>Activation</strong></span></h4><p>So you’ve got loads of visitors, but you’re not making any profit?</p><p>This stage of the funnel is where a huge part of a growth marketer’s efforts lie. Now, you’re looking to finally reap the benefits of the time you invested during the previous stage by converting your visitors into leads. The most common tactic for this is to get them to share their email with you and willingly accept to receive regular updates and newsletter from your company.</p><p>The process works much like a purchase. You give them access to unique content or offers and, in return, they pay by offering you their contact details.</p><p>Beyond this exchange, you’re also going to focus on nurturing your leads so you can help them make decisions. It’s now that you should redirect your efforts towards showing value, putting your best social proof forward, and offering excellent customer experience.</p><h4><span><strong><br>Retention</strong></span></h4><p>What about returning visitors or product users?</p><p>During this stage you’ll focus on why people are coming back, why they’re leaving, and if there are any opportunities for you to upsell and cross-sell your products.</p><p>Retention can be something as simple as a person coming back to read your blog on a regular basis, engaging with your content, or just buying the same product several times.</p><p>To prevent leads from slipping away and forgetting about your brand altogether, you’re looking at all the ways in which you can stay relevant and useful. <a href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/brand-loyalty-statistics">56% of consumers</a> remain loyal to companies who understand them.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lately, I’ve been revisiting concepts and algorithms that I got stuck on when I was learning to code. One of them is the boids flocking simulation.</p>
<p>We’ll look at how this program can be written in Go and delivered via WebAssembly. You can find all the source code for this article, as well as the <a href="https://healeycodes.github.io/boids/">WASM demo</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/boids">healeycodes/boids</a>.</p>

</center>
<p>A boid is a simulated bird-like object, a bird-oid. Each boid looks at their local flockmates and uses three rules to respond to their behavior — <em>separation</em>, <em>alignment</em>, and <em>cohesion</em>.</p>
<p>This artificial life program was first developed by Craig Reynolds. In <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/boids.html">Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model</a> he describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course.</p>

<p><a href="https://ebiten.org/">Ebiten</a> is well documented and has a lively community (<code>#ebiten</code> channel in <a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/gophers-slack-community/">Gophers Slack</a>). I started learning it by extending the <a href="https://ebiten.org/examples/">example programs</a> to get used to the API.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the overall structure of our program.</p>
<p>When you build a game with Ebiten, you must implement the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten#Game">ebiten.Game</a> interface. We define a <code>Game</code> struct to store our flock of boids as well as the methods required by Ebiten to run our game. <code>Update</code> is called every tick to handle the game logic, <code>Draw</code> is called every frame to draw the screen, and <code>Layout</code> is used to define the game’s screen size (which can be ‘stretched’ to fit the window).</p>

<h3 id="game-loops"><a href="#game-loops" aria-label="game loops permalink"></a>Game Loops</h3>
<p>Almost every game that you’ve played uses a programming pattern called a <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">Game Loop</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A game loop runs continuously during gameplay. Each turn of the loop, it processes user input without blocking, updates the game state, and renders the game. It tracks the passage of time to control the rate of gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The frequency of a game loop is sometimes referred to as the tick rate of a game. A single iteration of the loop is a <em>tick</em>.</p>
<h2 id="simulation-logic"><a href="#simulation-logic" aria-label="simulation logic permalink"></a>Simulation Logic</h2>
<p>In our program, a boid has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position — the coordinates of the boid in the world</li>
<li>Velocity — how fast and in what direction the boid is moving</li>
<li>Acceleration — we change the velocity by this value during the next tick</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Boid <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    imageWidth   <span>int</span>
    imageHeight  <span>int</span>
    position     Vector2D 
    velocity     Vector2D
    acceleration Vector2D
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Every tick, we need to handle three things for every boid in our flock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check edges — check if the boid has gone off the edge of the screen</li>
<li>Apply rules — using the three rules, set every boid’s acceleration</li>
<li>Apply movement — apply acceleration to the boid’s velocity</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Flock <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    boids <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>Boid
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span>flock <span>*</span>Flock<span>)</span> <span>Logic</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> boid <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> flock<span>.</span>boids <span>{</span>
        boid<span>.</span><span>ApplyEdges</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

        boid<span>.</span><span>ApplyMovement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To handle boids hitting the edge of the screen, we wrap them around by swapping their position to the opposite side. Their velocity means they keep flying in the same relative direction.</p>
<p>After we’ve figured out the boid’s acceleration by applying the three rules, we need to update its position and velocity, and reset acceleration.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span>boid <span>*</span>Boid<span>)</span> <span>ApplyMovement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    boid<span>.</span>position<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span>boid<span>.</span>velocity<span>)</span>
    boid<span>.</span>velocity<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span>boid<span>.</span>acceleration<span>)</span>

    boid<span>.</span>acceleration<span>.</span><span>Multiply</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By adding acceleration to the boid’s existing velocity, and then limiting it by a maximum speed, we get smooth movement that tends towards the desired direction and speed. Velocity can be thought of as momentum and acceleration as steering.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-rules"><a href="#the-three-rules" aria-label="the three rules permalink"></a>The Three Rules</h2>
<p>In the following code excerpts, you may notice that the logic is not very optimized. This is to make it easier to understand. On every tick, every boid considers the position of every other boid. We would say that the asymptotic complexity is <code>O(n^2)</code>.</p>
<p>Different rules use different ‘inclusion’ zones. Whether another boid is <em>local</em> to another boid depends on which rule we are applying.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>maxForce             <span>=</span> <span>1.0</span>
maxSpeed             <span>=</span> <span>4.0</span>
alignPerception      <span>=</span> <span>75.0</span>
cohesionPerception   <span>=</span> <span>100.0</span>
separationPerception <span>=</span> <span>50.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last three values are really fun to play with and greatly affect the shape and contortions of a flock of boids. <code>maxForce</code> limits the steering of a boid and <code>maxSpeed</code> is the ultimate speed limit.</p>
<p>I’ve expanded some of Craig Reynolds’ low-resolution diagrams to help explain the three rules that define a boid’s behavior.</p>
<h3 id="separation"><a href="#separation" aria-label="separation permalink"></a>Separation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The closer another boid is to us, the more motivated we are to move away from it. The white circle represents <code>separationPerception</code>. Boids outside of this area are not considered. This rule encourages boids to move into free space.</p>

<p>To be a <em>cohesive</em> boid, one must head towards the center of the clump. This may seem at odds with <em>separation</em> but these two rules work together to let boids arrange themselves equally within a space. Although, the reality of this <em>arranging</em> can look quite chaotic!</p>

<p>It’s time to get this simulation in front of users! Lucky for us, Ebiten supports many platforms. (The Nintendo Switch is even on the <a href="https://ebiten.org/blog/roadmap2020.html#Ebiten_2.1_-_March,_2021">roadmap</a>.)</p>
<p>The current release (v1.11.4), supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD</li>
<li>Android, iOS</li>
<li>
<p>Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge)</p>
<ul>
<li>via WebAssembly or GopherJS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be compiling to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a>. With WebAssembly as a compilation target, we can deliver our Go program to anyone running a modern browser. I’m currently hosting it on <a href="https://healeycodes.github.io/boids/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of WebAssembly? In brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, efficient, and portable</li>
<li>Executes at ‘near-native’ speed</li>
<li>Runs in a secure sandbox</li>
</ul>
<p>To get our Boid program ready for users, we build the <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o dist/boids.wasm github.com/healeycodes/boids</code></pre></div>
<p>We set the build’s target operating system to <code>js</code> as well as setting the architecture to <code>wasm</code>. If you’re setting this up from scratch, you’ll need a copy of <code>wasm_exec.js</code> from the Go source — you can copy it locally from your machine or get it from <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js">golang/go</a>.</p>
<p>To display the simulation in a browser, we use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiate">WebAssembly.instantiate</a>. Here’s what our index page looks like:</p>

                                        An Azure subscription is linked to a single account, the one that was used to create the subscription. It's used for billing entity and security boundary.<br>
                                        Azure subscriptions manage resources, limits, and provide the charges billed to the account owner.
                                    </p>

                                        An Azure AD directory can be associated with multiple subscriptions, but a subscription is always tied to a single directory.<br>
                                        Azure subscriptions can only trust a single directory, but multiple subscriptions can be associated to a single Azure AD instance.

                                        True. While a single directory is created for the organization initially, more can be created to divide the security across boundaries.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
           <div itemprop="articleBody">
            
  <div id="double-entry-accounting-for-developers">

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

Yes, a lot! As developers, we’re continually writing code, and we do that by passing messages. Each message carries a lot of context and semantics. Therefore we’re always evolving how to do it in a better way.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is this vastly known anecdote that says that there are only&nbsp;</span><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">two hard things in Computer Science</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: caching invalidation and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">naming</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;things.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terminology is in the roots of communication, and therefore is as vital for writing quality code as writing User Stories, documentation, and even naming branches.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you care a lot about communicating effectively, I think we must use an&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">inclusive language</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to do so.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inclusive writing is the usage of the language with neutrality. Inclusiveness has a positive impact on our lives, as they don’t offend interlocutors based on abilities/disabilities, age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It would be best to read</span> <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">this content guide</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that describes how to be more inclusive when writing. The impact of fostering more inclusive writing implies changes in how we write software. Besides, sooner or later, we see that it affects many aspects of everyday life communication. 🌱</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some time ago,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/4/229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a proposal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;regarding the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch name in </span><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/tag/git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Git</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> came up. I got pleased that the concern of an inclusive language arrived in the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/category/development-tools">tool I use every day for development</a>. The proposal addresses replacing the master branch name by a more inclusive one, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=49decddd39e5f6132ccd7d9fdc3d7c470b0061bb">such as <code>main</code>, <code>primary</code>, or <code>principal</code></a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At SourceLevel, we have opted for using <code>main</code>&nbsp;as the default branch name. Did you know you can change the default branch in your Git repositories? You can do it by both </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitLab</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Project Settings &gt; Repository</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">) and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitHub</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Repository Settings &gt; Branches</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the default branch of your repositories may break some tools. In the case of SourceLevel, we already support the custom default branch, and it synchronizes with GitHub and GitLab. Changing on those tools automatically replicates in our tool.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Steps for changing your default branch</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the examples below, I rename the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to <code>main</code>. You should discuss with your team and find the name that better suits you.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, we need to rename it locally:</span></p>
<pre><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git branch -m master main
</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git push origin main -u</span></pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And you’re done! These two commands rename your local <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch and then push it to the remote server. It’s a secure way to start, once the commands don’t delete the remote <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note that after changing the name to main, everyone who clones the repository gets the new default branch set. However, people who had previously cloned the repository are still pointing to the master branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To move forward with the change, everyone in your team needs to run a <a href="https://twitter.com/xunit/status/1269881005877256192">few commands</a>. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For a complete guide, I strongly recommend reading </span><a href="https://dev.to/damcosset/replacing-master-in-git-2jim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Damien Cosset’s blog post</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using SourceLevel as an Inclusive Language watchdog</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now that we have a more inclusive branch name, there may be references to other terms that we should avoid. They may appear in variables, methods, or even comments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, we need to look for them the whole codebase. This part can demand lots of hard work, depending on the size and terminology used throughout codebases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the existing code doesn’t prevent you or your team from using exclusive language again. What if a bot could notify you when a contravention appears? You can use the <a href="https://docs.sourcelevel.io/engines/grep/"><code>grep</code> linter </a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as a watchdog!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Configure your <code>.sourcelevel.yml</code> file adding rules that look for exclusive language and suggest more appropriate terms for each Pull or Merge Requests using SourceLevel’s <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/automated-code-review">automated code review</a> feature. It should look something like this:</span></p>
<pre>engines:
  grep:
    config:
      patterns:
        allowlist:
          pattern: "/white[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Whitelist'. Prefer the term 'Allowlist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
        blocklist:
          pattern: "/black[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Blacklist'. Prefer the term 'Blocklist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
    enabled: true</pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After pushing it to the main branch, SourceLevel can help you achieve a more inclusive language throughout the codebase!</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In short</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using an inclusive language is crucial for fostering a diverse culture. Git has changed the naming conventions to be more language-inclusive, and so you should change. Our development tools, like GitHub and GitLab, already supports the change.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SourceLevel deals very nicely with repositories that changed the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to a more appropriate word. Besides, you can use the <code>grep</code>&nbsp;linter the look for exclusive terms contained in the source code.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the inclusive language gap may happen in other aspects of our lives, have you already thought about them?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Raise the discussion in your team and use the tools to favor a more inclusive world 💚!</span></p>

<p>By using crypto signals, traders can determine the best way to manage their capital, the way to be able to prevent losses, the way to establish and change targets to reach the biggest profit potential. Crypto signal providers are an excellent source of information that is otherwise hard to come by. It takes a level of knowledge and also a reliable strategy to create a profit from any sort of trading, including crypto trading. Not everyone has that understanding, and not everyone can create those strategies. </p>



<p>Crypto signals are essentially the cryptocurrency version of insider information and stock market tips. Providers analyze the market to predict the trades to create. Please note, however, these predictions are the result of evaluation and rarely come from real insider information on the current market even if some providers claim they do. </p>



<h2>What are Cryptocurrency Signals? </h2>



<p>It is well worth investing in crypto signals, whether you’re a new dealer or have years of experience. These signals are certain to improve your trading activity. They provide new investors the chance to construct their portfolio and earn money as they learn the principles of trading. These recommendations generally involve purchasing or selling a particular crypto coin, making investments in new ICO projects, and taking part in a pump and dump strategy(which we don’t do). </p>



<p>Remember that not all signal suppliers are created equal. Do just a little due diligence in to finding the best provider, which means you don’t lose more money than you’re making. </p>



<p>Free trials are ending soon, want to test us out? Do so by the 1st of August 2020<br>Go for it, worst case scenario, you learn something new .<br>Go ahead,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.me/sublime_signals_payment_bot" target="_blank"><strong>👉interact with our bot</strong></a></p>



<p>These cryptocurrency signals can allow you to learn more about various coins and how they are performing, in addition to offer advice on whether to buy and sell coins to the most profit. Crypto signals are similar to the insider information people use on the stock exchange. These signals are based on research and analysis performed by men and women that have a profound comprehension of the crypto marketplace. </p>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/GetMonero-bitcoin-btc-mmtg-QuspXi6Va6Scge0PB7">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>This demand for help is the reason behind crypto trade signals, which are designed to help people understand — and master — cryptocurrency trading. Here is more information about cryptocurrency signals and their function in gambling. There’s more to crypto signals than that, though. </p>



<p>There’s more to those signals than just the knowledge they offer. Providers can use these groups to maximize their gains. By finding the right signal providers and cooperating together, beginners and experts alike can find the best buy and sell positions. There’s much more to trading cryptocurrency than the trading process — it takes an efficient trading strategy. </p>



<p>Beginners, and even some professionals, rely on outside assistance to make profitable trades. Crypto signals are easy to use and offer better results from trading at less time. They provide a level of flexibility and advantage for traders looking to benefit from the limitless possibility of the cryptocurrency trading market. There’s always some commerce waiting to be produced on this broad market, so being able to receive tips on the most recent and biggest trades is worth your time. Even strategy, like alternating between long-term investments and traders, doesn’t apply to everybody. </p>



<p>There is still the matter of deciding on the ideal coins to trade and which ones to avoid. Where trading signals come into play, this is. The Function of in trading cryptocurrency signals. Possibly the most significant job of signals in trading is that they facilitate trading. Beginners may use signals to get started with their trades and learn more about trading. Signals offer valuable understanding about cryptocurrencies and are an excellent learning resource. </p>



<p>These signals are the result of lots of analysis of their market scenario. Signals can help traders to make the choice on a trade. Some dealers can misunderstand the marketplace when seeking to develop with these predictions themselves. Crypto signals assist traders and prevent the issue of analysis paralysis. When traders get so caught up in contemplation and evaluation they don’t act in time. It’s among the biggest problems preventing individuals from becoming successful. Signal providers do all of the work for you so you do not get caught inside your head, wondering in the event that you should make the trade. </p>



<h2>Conclusion </h2>



<p>The short and long of this is that crypto trading signals offer users the opportunity to make and learn all at precisely the same moment. Provided that you choose the ideal supplier, you’re certain to make some profit by following their guidance. Given these providers offer you clear, detailed information about their signals, you will also have the opportunity to learn from them and create the right system and strategy all your own.</p>

				<p>Remember the Ubuntu Unity spin edition that popped up a few months ago? Well, the same young developer behind that product is at it again. In a cryptic new Twitter post of only the words <em>“Coming soon! Stay tuned!”</em> from the new handle of <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu Web</a>, Rudra Saraswat has my attention.</p>
<p>The Twitter bio for this new account is really all we have to go on at this point, but color me intrigued. It seems to be positioned as an alternative to Chrome OS. Ironically, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-secret-origins-of-googles-chrome-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project that became Chrome OS</a> was originally running a modified Firefox UI.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“<span>Ubuntu Web combines the power of Ubuntu &amp; Firefox to give you a powerful, open source web OS.</span>“</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As we move more and more to a cloud-focused future, the combination of Ubuntu running <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/new-years-resolution-try-using-firefox-full-time-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> in a dedicated UI could make for a pretty powerful mashup. And as someone who is already concerned with web standards moving towards a world of only tech surrounding the Chrome browser, it’s a welcome alternative.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coming soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>— Ubuntu Web (@ubunweb) <a href="https://twitter.com/ubunweb/status/1285993537499095040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While this isn’t the first time we’ve seen cloud-first distros in the world of Linux, I hope the team at Ubuntu Web can really find some traction. Rudra’s previous work with <a href="https://rappingpenguin.com/my-three-weeks-with-the-system76-lemur-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a> could lay a decent groundwork. Unity had many cloud elements built into the interface that with some tweaking may be able to leverage new hooks powered by Firefox.</p>
<p>We wish the Ubuntu Web team luck in this new venture and we’ll keep a close eye on any progress of this intriguing project.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>You know what really sucks? Breaking bones. I’d been watching too many mountain biking videos on YouTube and after the first jump on a ride at my local bike trails, I came to realise that my enthusiasm and confidence far outweighed my skill. After over-jumping the jump, hitting a tree, flying over the bars and landing directly on my left shoulder 4 metres down the trail, I now have a broken clavicle (collar bone).</p>

<p>Living in the UK, we have public health care, so my brother drove me straight to Accident and Emergency. An x-ray soon confirmed that I’d snapped my collar bone in two, but apparently there’s not very much to be done. They gave me a sling, told me I’d need to take some pain killers for a few days, and booked me in at the fracture clinic for the following day. At the fracture clinic I go through the x-rays with a specialist doctor while he tells me about the next ten weeks of my life are going to be like. At this point I can barely move my arm. My shoulder’s the size of a water melon and turning yellow. Ten weeks like this. Shit.</p>

<p>I work as a software developer. Mainly ASP.NET and C# stuff. This means I live in Visual Studio… all day, everyday. Have you ever tried to work in VS one handed? Give it a try. It can be done but it’s not easy. One of the hardest things are keyboard shortcuts. Alt+Enter especially. I’ve got big hands, but even I struggle with that one using only my right hand. Luckily most functionality is available through context menus or through other parts of the UI.</p>

<p>A fantastic thing about VS is that nearly all keyboard shortcuts are remappable. I’d never thought of this as an accessibility feature before, but it really is. I’ve resisted changing anymore keyboard shortcuts than strictly necessary, as I’m intending to start using both arms again one day, but it’s fantastic that this is available in a tool that I rely on to work and pay the bills.</p>

<p>The majority of my work as a developer is web based, so when considering accessibility I tend to think about making things accessible for those with visual impairments; the blind and the partially sighted. Ensuring that the site works with screen readers and making sure controls and text have sufficient size and contrast is where a lot of accessibility effort is generally focused. There’s also things like not making tap targets not too close together, which is as much a mobile friendliness consideration as an accessibility consideration.</p>

<p>As most of my work is for the web, I don’t develop very many piece of software that utilise keyboard shortcuts extensively. If any of my future work does incorporate keyboard shortcuts, I’m certainly going to be considering how people with physical restrictions will be able to use them.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the “official” guidelines for keyboard shortcut accessibility are (or whether there are any guidelines!), but during the last few weeks of convalescence I’ve thought about the guidelines that I’d appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-guidelines-for-keyboard-shortcuts">Accessibility guidelines for keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single handed shortcuts:</strong> Prefer shortcut keys that can be reached with a single hand. Most shortcuts are comprised of a modifier key (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Win, Cmd) along with another “normal” key. Try to keep the “normal” key within reasonable reach of the modifier. Shift and Ctrl <em>usually</em> have keys on both sides of the keyboard, so more keys can be paired with these. Note that although Alt appears on both sides of the space bar, the right hand key is AltGr. They are actually two different keys, so keep that in mind when mapping shortcuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Remappable:</strong> It’s not always reasonable to make all the default keyboard shortcuts single-handed. It’s also likely that for able bodied users, some single handed shortcuts may actually be less comfortable or convenient than shortcuts that require both hands. That’s fine, and it’s a good idea to cater to your primary demographic. It’s also a good idea to allow users to remap these shortcuts. It’s not simply an accessibility feature, it’s great for the types that love to customise everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide alternatives:</strong> Providing an interface to allow users to remap their keyboard shortcuts isn’t always feasible. Maybe there’s no budget, or the scope of the project simply doesn’t allow for it. In these cases it’s simple and quick to provide alternatives to more complex or finger-stretching shortcuts. It doesn’t have to be every shortcut, but for commonly used shortcuts that are more comfortable with two hands, consider adding single-handed alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Nothing fancy or too technical. If in doubt about whether a keyboard shortcut complies with these guidelines, just try it with one hand! Imagine having to do that every time you require that shortcut… you’ll soon figure out whether it’s accessible or not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">

<p>Floating-point formats are not the most glamorous or (frankly) the important
consideration when working with deep learning models: if your model isn’t working well,
then your floating-point format certainly isn’t going to save you! However, past a
certain point of model complexity/model size/training time, your choice of
floating-point format can have a significant impact on your model training times and
even performance.</p>
<p>Here’s how the rest of this post is structured:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Why should you, a deep learning practitioner,
care</a> about what floating-point format your
model uses?</li>
<li><a href="#floating-point-formats">What even <em>is</em> floating-point</a>, especially these new
floating-point formats made specifically for deep learning?</li>
<li><a href="#advice-for-practitioners">What practical advice is there</a> on using floating-point
formats for deep learning?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Floating-Point? In <em>My</em> Deep Learning?</h2>
<p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/6052-its-more-likely-than-you-think">It’s more likely than you
think!</a></p>
<p>It’s been known for quite some time that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">deep neural networks can
tolerate</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">lower numerical
precision</a>. High-precision calculations turn out not
to be that useful in training or inferencing neural networks: the additional precision
confers no benefit while being slower and less memory-efficient.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, some models can even reach a higher accuracy with lower precision, which
recent research attributes to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00095">regularization effects from the lower
precision</a>.</p>
<p>Finally (and this is speculation on my part — I haven’t seen any experiments or papers
corroborating this), it’s possible that certain complicated models <em>cannot converge</em>
unless you use an appropriately precise format. There’s a drift between the analytical
gradient update and what the actual backward propagation looks like: the lower the
precision, the bigger the drift. I’d expect that deep learning is particularly
susceptible to an issue here because there’s a lot of multiplications, divisions and
reduction operations.</p>
<h2 id="floating-point-formats">Floating-Point Formats</h2>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at three floating-point formats for deep learning. There are a
lot more floating-point formats, but only a few have gained traction: floating-point
formats require the appropriate hardware and firmware support, which restricts the
introduction and adoption of new formats.</p>
<p>For a quick overview, Grigory Sapunov wrote a great <a href="https://medium.com/@moocaholic/fp64-fp32-fp16-bfloat16-tf32-and-other-members-of-the-zoo-a1ca7897d407">run-down of various floating-point
formats for deep
learning</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ieee-floating-point-formats">IEEE floating-point formats</h3>
<p>These floating-point formats are probably what most people think of when someone says
“floating-point”. The IEEE standard 754 sets out several formats, but for the purposes
of deep learning we are only interested three:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format">FP16</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">FP32</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">FP64</a> (a.k.a.
half-, single- and double-precision floating-point formats)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Let’s take FP32 as an example. Each FP32 number is a sequence of 32 bits,
. Altogether, this sequence represents the real number</p>

<p>Here,  (the <em>sign bit</em>) determines the sign of the represented value.</p>
<p> through  determine the magnitude or scale of the represented value
(notice that a change in any of these bits drastically changes the size of the
represented value). These bits are called the <em>exponent</em> or <em>scale bits</em>.</p>
<p>Finally,  through  determine the precise value of the represented
value. These bits are called the <em>mantissa</em> or <em>precision bits</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the more bits you have, the more you can do. Here’s how the three formats
break down:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Sign Bits</th>
<th>Exponent (Scale) Bits</th>
<th>Mantissa (Precision) Bits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FP16</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP32</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP64</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>53</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are some details that I’m leaving out here (e.g. how to represent NaNs, positive
and negative infinities), but this is largely how floating point numbers work. A lot
more detail can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers">Wikipedia
page</a>
and of course the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229">latest revision of the IEEE standard
754</a> itself.</p>
<p>FP32 and FP64 are widely supported by both software (C/C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and
hardware (x86 CPUs and most NVIDIA/AMD GPUs).</p>
<p>FP16, on the other hand, is not as widely supported in software (you need to use <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">a
special library</a> to use them in C/C++). However, since
deep learning is trending towards favoring FP16 over FP32, it has found support in the
main deep learning frameworks (e.g. <code>tf.float16</code> and <code>torch.float16</code>). In terms of
hardware, FP16 is not supported in x86 CPUs as a distinct type, but is well-supported on
modern GPUs.</p>
<h3 id="google-bfloat16">Google BFloat16</h3>
<p>BFloat16 (a.k.a. the Brain Floating-Point Format, after Google Brain) is basically the
same as FP16, but 3 mantissa bits become exponent bits (i.e. bfloat16 trades 3 bits’
worth of precision for scale).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, there are generally three “flavors” of values: weights,
activations and gradients. Google suggests storing weights and gradients in FP32, and
storing activations in bfloat16. However, in particularly gracious circumstances,
weights can be stored in bfloat16 without a significant performance degradation.</p>
<p>You can read a lot more on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bfloat16-the-secret-to-high-performance-on-cloud-tpus">Google Cloud
blog</a>,
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12322">this paper by Intel and Facebook studying the bfloat16
format</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of software support, bfloat16 is not supported in C/C++, but is supported in
TensorFlow (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>tf.bfloat16</code></a>) and
PyTorch (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>torch.bfloat16</code></a>).</p>
<p>In terms of hardware support, it is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Lake_(microarchitecture)">some modern
CPUS</a>, but the real
support comes out in GPUs and ASICs. At the time of writing, bfloat16 is supported by
the NVIDIA A100 (the first GPU to support it!), and <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/260344/future-amd-gpu-architecture-to-implement-bfloat16-hardware">will be supported in future AMD
GPUs</a>.
And of course, it is supported by Google TPU v2/v3.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-tensorfloat">NVIDIA TensorFloat</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn’t really its own floating-point format, just an overzealous
branding of the technique that NVIDIA developed to train in mixed precision on their
Tensor Core hardware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An NVIDIA TensorFloat (a.k.a. TF32) is just a 32-bit float that drops 13 precision bits
in order to execute on Tensor Cores. Thus, it has the precision of FP16 (10 bits), with
the range of FP32 (8 bits). However, if you’re not using Tensor Cores, it’s just a
32-bit float; if you’re only thinking about storage, it’s just a 32-bit float.</p>

</figure>
<p>One distinct advantage of TF32 is that they’re kind of like FP32. To quote from the
NVIDIA developer blog,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications using NVIDIA libraries enable users to harness the benefits of TF32 with no
code change required. TF32 Tensor Cores operate on FP32 inputs and produce results in
FP32. Non-matrix operations continue to use FP32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more about TF32 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/">on the NVIDIA
blog</a>, and
about its hardware support in the Ampere architecture on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/">the NVIDIA developer
blog</a>.</p>
<p>TF32 is not in the C/C++ standard at all, but is supported in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-11-features-revealed/">CUDA
11</a>.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, the NVIDIA A100 is the first GPU (and, at the time of writing, the only
device) supporting TF32.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-practitioners">Advice for Practitioners</h2>
<p>The first thing to say is that floating-point formats are <em>by no means</em> the most
important consideration for your deep learning model — not even close. Floating-point
formats will most likely only make a difference for very large or complex models, for
which fitting the model on GPU memory is a challenge, or for which training times are
excruciatingly long.</p>
<p>The second thing to say is that any practical advice has to be heavily dependent on what
hardware you have available to you.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-mixed-precision-amp-training--a-good-default">Automatic mixed precision (AMP) training — a good default</h3>
<p>Most deep learning stacks support mixed-precision training, which is a pretty good
default option to reap some of the benefits of low-precision training, while still
reasonably avoiding underflow and overflow problems.</p>
<p>TensorFlow supports <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision">mixed-precision training
natively</a>, whereas the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex">NVIDIA Apex
library</a> makes automatic mixed precision training
available in PyTorch. To get started, take a look at NVIDIA’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision">developer guide for
AMP</a>, and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html">documentation for
training in mixed
precision</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth going over the gist of mixed precision training. There are basically two main
tricks:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Loss scaling:</em> multiply the loss by some large number, and divide the gradient
updates by this same large number. This avoids the loss underflowing (i.e. clamping
to zero because of the finite precision) in FP16, while still maintaining faithful
backward propagation.</li>
<li><em>FP32 master copy of weights</em>: store the weights themselves in FP32, but cast them to
FP16 before doing the forward and backward propagation (to reap the performance
benefits). During the weight update, the FP16 gradients are cast to FP32 to update
the master copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about these techniques in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740">this paper by NVIDIA and Baidu
Research</a>, or on the accompanying <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/">blog post by
NVIDIA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-floating-point-formats--make-sure-itll-be-worth-it">Alternative floating-point formats — make sure it’ll be worth it</h3>
<p>If you’ve already trained your model in mixed precision, it might not be worth the time
or effort to port your code to take advantage of an alternative floating-point format
and bleeding edge hardware.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to go that route, make sure your use case really demands it.
Perhaps you can’t scale up your model without using bfloat16, or you really need to cut
down on training times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have a well-informed opinion on how bfloat16 stacks up against
TF32, so “do your homework” is all I can advise. However, since the NVIDIA A100s only
just (at the time of writing) dropped into the market, it’ll be interesting to see what
the machine learning community thinks of the various low precision options available.</p>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people. If the drug doesn’t work in people, there is no iterating. If you want to modify the product, you need to restart the entire process over again. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_633705"><div><h2><strong>Founders &amp; Market</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around a market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around key biology</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_651094"><div><p>In tech, a prototypical founder often worked at the incumbent company or realized a market opportunity by being that market themself.

If anything, older founders may be subconsciously discriminated against in favor for younger founders. </p><p>In biotech, the prototypical founder is older, often a career CEO or exec coming out of a Big Pharma company. At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing. Once a new market is validated, other companies/copycats/fast-followers flow in. </p><p>In biotech, the market opportunities are diseases.

Bifurcated markets can be especially dangerous as companies compete on pricing and ‘race to the bottom’.</p><p>In biotech, the markets are <em>so </em>large, and the unmet need so high, that there can and often are many winners in one market (disease). The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug.

                  I set up a procedural content creation pipeline that imports <a href="http://stinaflodstrom.com/projects/osm/www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data into Unity and uses the Houdini Engine to create realistic cityscapes based on real world locations. The goal was to have an as automated process as possible for generating environments based on real cities. The buildings and the roads are generated from OSM building shapes and road splines using a procedural system for building type and prop placing. Traffic lights, Crossings and Trees also get their positions from OSM. Values and procedural parameters can be tweaked in Unity making it possible to create endless variations.

                  </p><p>The project was developed with the simulation team in one of the bigger automotive companies as a proof of concept for creating syntetic data for AI and render out annotated images. The environmant is complete with tags for segmentation.

		<p>Every time we have a sort of financial crisis that has something to do with settlement, and collaterals, and weird instruments, people start questioning why more instruments are not traded on exchanges. They cite the example of equities, which world over are exchange traded, centrally settled, and whose markets function rather efficiently.</p>
<p>After the 2008 Financial Crisis, for example, there was a move to take Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to exchanges, rather than letting the market go over the counter (OTC). Every few years, ideas are floated about trading bonds on exchanges (rather than OTC, like they are now), and the blame falls on “greedy bankers who don’t want to let go of control”.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-16/odd-lots-podcast-under-the-rusty-hood-of-the-8-trillion-corporate-bond-market">excellent podcast by Bloomberg Odd Lots</a> where Chris White, a former Goldman Sachs banker, talks about how the equity markets went electronic in the 1970s with NASDAQ, and how the “big bang” in the UK markets propelled equities into electronic trading everywhere.</p>
<p>A lot of these ideas have also been discussed in <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B074WC3FFX">my book on market design</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM.png"><img data-attachment-id="9010" data-permalink="https://noenthuda.com/blog/2017/12/05/bond-market-liquidity-and-selection-bias/screen-shot-2017-12-05-at-10-30-33-pm/" data-orig-file="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM.png" data-orig-size="1188,1336" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 10.30.33 PM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-267x300.png" data-large-file="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-911x1024.png" src="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-911x1024.png" alt="" width="840" height="944" srcset="https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-911x1024.png 911w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-133x150.png 133w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-267x300.png 267w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM-768x864.png 768w, https://noenthuda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-05-at-10.30.33-PM.png 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></a></p>
<p>In any case, I think I have the perfect explanation of why bond trading on exchanges hasn’t really taken off. To understand this, let’s look at another market that I discussed extensively in my book – the market for relationships (that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/SQmnAdsSW71Iu9M9qhKchP/Binders-full-of-women.html">chapter has been extracted</a> in Mint).</p>
<p>The market for relationships is in the news thanks to this Netflix documentary called Indian Matchmaking. I started watching it on a whim on Saturday night, and I got so addicted to it that yesterday I postponed my work to late night so that I could finish the show instead.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZS2KbLAy5Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Marriage can be thought of as a sale of “<a href="https://noenthuda.com/blog/2009/02/12/50-stake-sale/">50% of the rest of your life</a>“, paid for by 50% of the rest of someone else’s life.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can go about it – either “over the counter” (finding a partner by yourself) or “exchange traded” (said exchange could be anything from newspaper classifieds to Tinder to Shaadi.com). Brokers are frequently used in the OTC market – either parents or friends (who set you up) or priests.</p>
<p>The general rule of markets is that the more bespoke (or “weird” or “unusual”) an instrument is, the better the likelihood of finding a match in the OTC markets than on exchanges. The reason is simple – for an exchange to exist, the commodity being traded needs to be a commodity.</p>
<p>Read any literature on agricultural markets, for example, and they all talk about “assaying” and “grading” the commodities. The basic idea is that all goods being traded on a marketplace are close enough substitutes of each other that they can be interchanged for each other.</p>
<p>Equity shares, by definition, are commodities. Equity and index derivatives are commodities as well, easy enough to define. Commodities are, by definition, commodities. Bond futures are commodities, since they can be standardised on a small number of axes. We’ll come to bonds in a bit.</p>
<p>Coming back to relationship markets, the “exchanges” work best if you have very few idiosyncrasies, and can be defined fairly well in terms of a small number of variables. It also helps you to find a partner quicker in case many others in the market have similar attributes as you, which means that the market for “your type of people” becomes “liquid” (this is a recurring theme in my book).</p>
<p>However, in case you are either not easily describable by commonly used variables, or in case there are few others like you in the market, exchanges are likely to work less well for you. Either of these conditions makes you “illiquid”, and it is not a great idea to list an illiquid asset on an exchange.</p>
<p>When you list an illiquid asset on an exchange, unless you are extremely lucky, it is likely to sit there for a long time without being traded (think about “bespoke exchanges” like eBay here, where commodification is not necessary). The longer the asset sits on an exchange, the greater the likelihood that people who come across the asset on the exchange think that “something is wrong with it”.</p>
<p>So if you’re listing it on an exchange, its value will decay exponentially, and unless you are able to trade soon after you have listed it, you are unlikely to get much value for it.</p>
<p>In that sense, if you are “illiquid” for whatever reason (can’t be easily described, or belong to a type that few others in the market belong to), exchanges are not for you. And if you think about each of the characters in Indian Matchmaking who come to Sima aunty, they are illiquid in one way or another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aparna has entered the market at 34, and few other women of her age are in the market. Hence illiquid.</li>
<li>Nadia belongs to a small ethnicity, Indian-Guyanese-American, which makes her illiquid.</li>
<li>Pradhyuman has quirky interests (jewelry and fashion), which his parents are trying to suppress as they pass him off a liquid “rich Maadu boy”. Quirky interests mean he’s not easily describable. Hence illiquid.</li>
<li>Vyasar, by Indian-American standards, doesn’t have a great job. So not too many others like him. Illiquid, even before you take his family situation into account.</li>
<li>Ankita is professionally ambitious. Few of those women in the Indian arranged marriage market. Illiquid.</li>
<li>Rupam is divorced with a child. Might be liquid by conventional American markets, but illiquid in an Indian context. And she is, rather inexplicably, going the Indian way despite being American.</li>
<li>Akshay is possibly the most liquid (characterless except for an overly-dominating mom), and maybe that’s why he’s shown getting engaged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these people will be wasting themselves listing themselves on exchanges. And so they come to a matchmaker. Now, Sima Auntie is both a broker and a clearinghouse (refer to <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B074WC3FFX">Chapter 3 of my book 😛</a>). She helps find matches for people, but only matches within her own inventory (though she decided Ankita has no matches at all in her own inventory, so connected her with another broker-clearinghouse).</p>
<p>This makes it hard – first of all you have illiquid assets, and you are trying to fulfil them within limited inventory. This is why she is repeatedly showing saying that her candidates need to “compromise” (something that seems to have triggered a lot of viewers). <strong>By compromise, she is saying that these people are so illiquid that in case they need to get a deal in her little exchange, they need to be willing to accept an “illiquidity discount” in order to get a trade.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Back to bonds, why is trading them on an exchange so difficult? Because each bond is so idiosyncratic. There is the issuer, the exact date of expiry and the coupon, and occasionally some weird derivatives tacked on. The likelihood that you might find someone quickly enough to take the other side of such a deal is minuscule, so if you were to list your bond on an exchange, its value would drop significantly (by being continuously listed) before you could find a counterparty.</p>
<p>Hence, people trade this uncertain discount to a certain discount, by trading their bonds with market makers (investment banks) who are willing to take the other side of the deal immediately.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, market making is not a viable strategy when it comes to relationship markets. So what do you do if you can either be not defined easily in a few parameters, or if there are few others like you in the arranged &nbsp;marriage market? You basically go Over The Counter. Ditch the market and find someone for yourself, or ask people you know to set you up. Or <a href="https://marriagebrokerauntie.com/">hire a matrimonial advisor</a> who will tell you what to do.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t convince you on why matchmakers are important, then may be you should read <a href="https://shapelygal.substack.com/p/indian-matchmaking"><strong>what my other half has to say</strong></a>. If she’s the better half or not, you figure.</p>

If that’s on my tombstone I failed. [13]</h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2><em>Put your money where your mind is.</em></h2></blockquote><p>Best investing attitude is contrarian, patient, informed optimism. As @m2jr says, “non-consensus and right.”&nbsp; [11]</p><p>The biggest gains in investing come when you bet against a gloomy crowd, on the upside. The low price already bakes their opinion in. Your losses are limited to 1x, and your gains are uncapped.&nbsp; [11]</p><p>Venture and value investors outperform via patience. Active trading is just another get-rich-quick scheme, with the same results.</p><p>I was trained on the efficient markets hypothesis, and yet every market that I've seen up close has been anything but. [11] </p><blockquote><h2><em>You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you can’t wait for consensus. </em></h2></blockquote><p>— </p><blockquote><h2><em>Investing is one of the few professions where you can objectively improve every day until the day that you die. </em></h2></blockquote><p><strong>What are some of your biggest successes in the investing world?</strong></p><p>I’ve thrown a lot of darts.</p><p>I don't necessarily take credit for it. Some people might say they were very thoughtful and did a lot of diligence. You know, some of it was luck. A lot of it was luck.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a first round investor in Twitter when it was first getting started. I was first investor in Uber, when it was getting started. Thumbtack, Wanelo, Flipagram. I was probably the first real investor in Postmates, after they got out of an incubator.</p><p>There's a bunch of them that goes on and on, it's hard for me to draw the full list. The fund I ran is on track to return 10-20x the capital it raised. And my individual portfolio is up by something like dozens of times. [6]</p><p>Angel bets and venture bets are great because they have nonlinear outcomes in the positive, but on the downside you can only lose 1x (where x is your investment). On the upside, you can make 10,000x.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve tried to rig the game. Basically, I try and set up good systems and then the individual decisions don’t matter that matter much. I think our ability to make individual decisions is actually not great. For example, as an investor, my system is: I want to see 10,000 companies and I want to pick 500 that have a shot of being huge. Then I want the option to double down on the five winners. I don’t want to just look at 100 companies and pick 10 that I think are winners and go all in on those. I don’t think I have that capability. [4]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Raising funding for good businesses is (slowly) getting easier. But picking good businesses is getting harder.</em></h2></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, at least in the technology business, there’s a lot of luck required. Right place, right time, market forces, timing, regulatory action against or pro. There’s a lot of things that control where the platforms are shifting, what open source efforts show up. You can never predict the outside successes. What you can predict is the failures.&nbsp;</p><p>You can say, “This person doesn’t know this field at all. They’re way out of their depth. This person, they’re a short-term thinker. They’re not going to last the game. They’re not going to go as far as needed.” [4]&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h2><em>Highly recommend that every would-be investor start a company first. It's hard to understand pain in the abstract. </em></h2></blockquote><p><strong>What are the things that you look for in founders, or the red flags that disqualify an investment or a founder?</strong></p><p>Number one, intelligence; you’ve got to be smart, which means you have to know what you’re doing, to some level. That’s a fuzzy thing but you talk to people and you kind of get a sense of do they know what they’re doing or not. Do they have insight, do they have specific knowledge? Have they thought about the problem deeply? It’s not about the age. It’s not how many years they’ve spent but just how deep is their understanding of what they’re about to do.”</p><p>So intelligence is key. Energy, because being a founder is brutally difficult. It takes a long time and in the long run, the people who succeed are just the ones who persevere. So if someone runs out of energy or if they’re doing this in some hesitating, preliminary way where they’re looking for constant positive feedback, or if they’re easily thrown off course, then they’re not going to make it to the end, especially in the highly competitive startup context.</p><p>And finally is integrity. Because if you have someone who is high intelligence and high energy but they’re low integrity, what you’ve got is a hard working, smart crook. [31]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Investing time/money behind someone?</em></h2><h2><em>- Do you like them?</em></h2><h2><em>- Can they teach you something you want to learn?</em></h2><h2><em>- Good economics?</em></h2><h2><em>If so, invest.</em></h2></blockquote><p>I co-founded AngelList because I was tired of saying no to entrepreneurs. I wanted to say instead, “yes, we can help you get funded.”</p><p>So, it’s especially disappointing when we get promising startups pitching on AngelList from remote locations. Some we’ve managed to get funded – including ones in Canada and Europe. Others are harder – especially in Russia, Latin America, and Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem, as I’ve come to realize, is that funding markets develop in reverse.</p><p>In any given geographic region, the first companies that get funded are the ones that least need funding. They have strong operating histories, auditable financials, predictable cash flows, etc.. Funding these companies is less risky, and so a secondary, and then a primary, market forms around them. Call these the public markets.</p><p>After the public markets come the mezzanine investors, investing just before a company goes public. And because the mezzanines now exist to pick up risk, late stage private investors start forming behind them. And so on and so forth until you end up with Seed incubators and Angel investors.</p><p>Essentially, the single biggest risk you have as an investor is “downstream financing risk.” The risk that the company won’t be able to raise more money once it has spent all of your cash.</p><p>This explains the apparent paradox that in less mature innovation cities, you’ll have an easier time finding VCs who will invest $10M in a mature business, than Angels who’ll invest $100K in a raw startup.</p><p>It’s a measure of the incredible strength of the Silicon Valley ecosystem that Y Combinator has chosen it as its hometown. YC and its brethren can only exist because of the rich Angel ecosystem. Paul Graham was smart enough to realize that his graduates couldn’t function without a rich Angel ecosystem, and went to great pains (such as AngelConf) to foster it.</p><p>Similarly, the true evidence that the NY Angel market has finally blossomed is that TechStars and a number of other seed combinators are choosing to do business there.</p><p>As an entrepreneur choosing your base of operations, take a careful look around. If you don’t see many VCs, you’re not likely to find many Angels either. Even though the VCs invest more money, they actually take less risk.</p><p>Angels should realize how this whole pyramid functions. Investing in companies that won’t have access to Venture is incredibly risky. Investing at Venture valuations in Angel-stage companies means that your portfolio will likely generate negative returns. [22]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Made lots of bad investments, but even when they lose, I never seem to regret the ones with hardcore techies doing difficult things.</em></h2></blockquote><p>In startup financings, each new investor brings new information but doesn't move the price. Ergo, following the herd is rational. [11] Startup financings exhibit herd mentality because there's no pricing. If first movers paid *a lot* less, financings would be rational. [11]</p><p><strong>You've probably seen more entrepreneurs before and after success than just about anybody ever. Of all the people who made it, how many could you tell five minutes after you met them “this one's gonna make it” and it doesn't even matter what the idea was?</strong></p><p>It's hard to tell which businesses are going to work because a lot of businesses fail. And a lot of good entrepreneurs chasing bad businesses fail. But the entrepreneurs themselves don't fail over a long period of time. When you meet the entrepreneurs who can be winners, they will be a winner, the question is just how many times. You may have to back them a few times. [73]</p><blockquote><h2><em>Asking a startup founder, "What's the Business Model?" betrays a lack of imagination. </em></h2></blockquote><p><strong>What are some of the mistakes you’ve made investing?</strong></p><p>I passed on Twilio very early on. Jeff Lawson is a great founder, and he gave me every chance to invest.&nbsp;</p><p>I passed on Pinterest, Ben Silberman gave me every chance to invest. We'd helped Ben a little bit with AngelList, although not a lot, we were just getting started. He was raising money for Pinterest. And I saw the numbers going up month to month to month. I had a chance to invest the first time, the second time, third time. He kept offering it to me. I was sitting in bed next to my fiance, and she was obsessively using Pinterest. She said, ‘I think you should do this.’ I was like, ‘I don't get it, it’s images, who's going to use that, how is it going to make money.’ So I passed on Pinterest. I've got a lot of stupid ones like that.</p><p>I could have been an Advisor YouTube in the early days. I helped them out, but didn't take any stock, even though they were kind enough to offer it.&nbsp;</p><p>There's lots and lots of misses. Square, I could have done the first round, and I thought it was too expensive. Even Twitter where I did my piece I did a much smaller piece than I was allocated, just because I thought it was too expensive. [6]</p><p><strong>What are the things that lead to you make bad investments, overriding your rules or intuition?</strong></p><p>I don't actually dwell on the bad investments much. In the startup world, you're betting that 90% of these companies will go to zero, or just return your money and the remaining 10% are going to post huge multiples. The Twitter investment is probably up 400x, Uber is probably up around 4,000x. So the returns of the winners …</p></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Welcome to the Build Your Own Heroku on Kubernetes series! Our goal is to build a self-hosted Heroku platform on Kubernetes because Heroku is expensive. <a href="https://www.stevennatera.com/heroku-sucks-kinda-how-their-pricing-pushed-me-to-ask-questions/">In the previous post</a> I told you I made a working prototype of our platform. Today you will learn how I used <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to create the cluster for our platform. I’ll share with you terraform files, conventions, and the system design choices I made for the cluster.</p><h2 id="three-ways-to-create-a-gke-cluster">Three ways to create a GKE cluster</h2><p>You can create a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud three ways. You can click through the cloud console. When you want to create a one-off cluster for experiments, the console is the best option. You can create a cluster using the <code>gcloud-cli</code> tool. The command line tool is great for scripting tasks.</p><p>When you want to declaratively provision resources Terraform is your best option. With Terraform, you can declare or write the infrastructure you want in a configuration file, version control the file with Git, and then provision the resources from the configuration file. If you forget what you provisioned, you can review the configuration file. You don’t need to click around in the console to inventory infrastructure.</p><h2 id="let-s-organize-our-infrastructure-project">Let’s organize our infrastructure project</h2><p>Terraform is a simple tool. Most of the time you use the <code>init</code>, <code>plan</code>, <code>apply</code>, and <code>destroy</code> commands. The most difficult task is choosing the proper folder structure and file organization. </p><p>Disorganization will cause rewrites. Chances are high your rewrites will break state management in Terraform and your files won't be reachable by the cli tool. There are ways to recover from an incomplete state but you can minimize those possibilities with a setup that grows with infrastructure requirements.</p><p>I have yet to find the best guides on project structure but I’ve managed to find a convention that works well for a solo developer projects. The convention is <strong><code>infra/PROVIDER__PROJECT-NAME__SERVICE/RESOURCE-NAME/*.tf</code></strong>. </p><p>First, you create an infrastructure directory for terraform. Then, create a folder with the provider name, the project name within the provider, and the product I’m using from their service catalog. Then, create a folder to represent an instance of the service resource. In that folder, I’ll place my terraform files. </p><p>In in practice the convention looks like, <code>/infra/gcp__labs__gke/micro</code>. From the path you know, you're on Google Cloud Platform, in a GCP project called <code>labs</code>, and a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine</a> cluster named <code>micro</code> exists. It’s not the best approach but it's been good enough for side projects. I'm a fan of this format because it's readable, double underscores prevent extensive nesting, and can be extended to include multiple providers. If you organize your Terraform project a different way, tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/stevennatera">@stevennatera</a> and let's chat!</p><h2 id="how-to-write-terraform-files">How to write Terraform files</h2><p>The following patterns are personal preferences. Even though we have multiple files, behind the scenes Terraform concatenates all your files before making infrastructure changes. If you wanted, you could put everything in single file. However multiple files prevent accidental changes other infrastructure components. Credentials are stored locally during iterations; we’ll figure out a better solution for production in later posts.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png" alt="Image of our Terraform project structure." srcset="https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 600w, https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 1000w, https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 1600w, https://www.stevennatera.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-25-at-9.17.47-AM.png 1780w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image of our Terraform project structure.</figcaption></figure><p>In <code>definitions.tf</code> you’ll find the declaration of variables we want to use within our configuration files. The <code>env.tf</code> file contains meta information needed for our resources. You’ll find the providers of our resources and the required Terraform version. </p><p>The <code>main.auto.tfvars</code> contains the values we want to assign to our variables. The values in files ending in <code>*.auto.tfvars</code> are automatically assigned to declared variables. The <code>main.tf</code> file contains all the resources we want to provision. Here you’ll find the cluster and node pool configurations.</p><figure><pre><code># main.tf

###############################################
# Node pool
###############################################

resource "google_container_node_pool" "micro" {
  name     = var.gke_node_pool_name
  location = var.gke_location
  cluster  = google_container_cluster.micro.name

  # 1 node per zone
  initial_node_count = 1

    auto_repair  = true
    auto_upgrade = true
  }

  node_config {
    preemptible  = var.gke_node_is_preemptible
    machine_type = var.gke_node_types
    disk_size_gb = var.gke_node_disk_size

    metadata = {
      disable-legacy-endpoints = "true"
    }

    oauth_scopes = [

  maintenance_policy {
    daily_maintenance_window {
      start_time = "03:00"
    }
  }
}</code></pre><figcaption>Detail view of main.tf</figcaption></figure><p>The Kubernetes control plane, where the master nodes reside, is declared in <code>google_container_cluster</code>. The data plane, a separately managed node pool for our workloads, is declared in <code>google_container_node_pool</code>. When we create our cluster with a separate node pool, instead of using the default one, we can maintain each resource independently.</p><p>A file not shown is <code>terraform.tfstate</code>. This file contains the current state of your infrastructure. If you delete this file, Terraform won’t be able to manage the declare resource. I save these files locally for prototypes. in production we should use a GCS bucket to store the state in a remote location. Now, let’s take a closer look at the values we specified.</p><figure><pre><code># main.auto.tfvars
### Variables to be automatically substituted

core_project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT"
core_region = "us-central1"
core_zone = "us-central1-a"

gke_location = "us-central1-a"
gke_node_types = "e2-standard-4"
gke_node_disk_size = 60
gke_node_is_preemptible = true

gke_autoscaling_min = 0
gke_autoscaling_max = 1

gke_cluster_name = "micro"
gke_node_pool_name = "micro"
gke_version = "1.16"
gke_node_locations = [
  "us-central1-b",
]</code></pre><figcaption>Values defined in main.auto.tfvars file.</figcaption></figure><p>Since I won’t know resource requirements until the completion of our project, I want to iterate on infrastructure for cheap. I started with the least expensive options, then worked my way up until the cluster could install all the components without crashing.</p><p>With these values a single node zonal cluster was created. You can tell the cluster master nodes are zonal by the value at <code>gke_location</code>. The value in <code>gke_node_locations</code> tells us we want 1 node per zone in the list. To save money, we use preemptible nodes. Preemptible nodes shut down after 24 hours of use, but have discount pricing up to 80% off on-demand instance prices. </p><p>The single worker node is of type <code>e2-standard-4</code> and runs Kubernetes version <code>1.16</code>. I chose a node type with 4 CPUs and 16GB of RAM to make sure the platform has enough compute resources. When the platform is stable, we might downsize the requirements, and add better autoscaling limits. With these values I’ve been able to iterate on the infrastructure for less than $1!</p><h2 id="provision-your-infrastructure">Provision your infrastructure</h2><p>To follow along, you can download these files from <a href="https://github.com/nodox/heroku-on-kubernetes-series">Github</a>. Create <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">a free GCP account</a> if you don’t have one. Install the <code><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud">gcloud-cli</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html">terraform-cli</a></code>. Create service account credentials for Terraform. The credentials must have the roles <code>Compute Viewer</code>, <code>Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin</code>, and <code>Service Account User</code>. Rename your credentials as <code>core.secret.json</code>. Then follow the bash commands in the <code>README.md</code> file. The <code>README.md</code> has the steps above in more detail.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h2><p>In our next post we'll install a serverless container runtime with <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> and configure <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> as our ingress gateway to receive traffic. Join the mailing list to stay updated with the series!</p><h2 id="additional-reading">Additional Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.stevennatera.com/heroku-sucks-kinda-how-their-pricing-pushed-me-to-ask-questions/">Part 1: Heroku sucks, kinda.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, in the tech world, no-code systems have been getting immense attention, and for good reasons. These types of systems allow the user to develop software with a much easier drag and drop interface, as opposed to the traditional coding using programming languages.<br></p><p>No-code systems have been gaining popularity because they provide a long list of advantages among which less manpower, less time, and an easier development process are the most significant ones. Some really popular examples of no-code systems are web design tools like WordPress, Webflow, and software development tools like Airtable, Nintex, Appy Pie, etc.<br></p><p>These days, no-code systems are turning out to be more and more advanced. And they are already being developed for more advanced technologies like AI and blockchain. In this blog, we will dive into the world of recommendation systems and why no-code recommendation systems are the future of AI. Let’s get started!</p><h2>Non-programmer friendly</h2><p>We know that building a recommendation system, or any system for that matter is not a one-man job. Programmers, non-programmers, business specialists, and executives are involved when it comes to that. It is not necessary that everyone knows how to code. In fact, in many cases, only a few members will know the actual programming portion.&nbsp;<br></p><p>No-code recommendation systems are advantageous in such cases because people who have access to the data will be able to use the system when the tech guys are not available or working on something more important. For example, in the case of <a href="https://caboom.ai/why-us">Caboom</a>, any executive, business owner, or product manager who has access to the data can use the system for testing the feasibility of the recommendation system without anyone’s help.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process which traditionally would require some manpower, more time, and additional expenses, will be done much faster with the help of a UI tool.</p><h2>AI Democratization</h2><p>AI democratization is a heavy term with a simple meaning: making AI accessible to everyone in an organization. AI is a revolutionary tool, and it <em>should</em> be accessible to anyone, specially non-AI people who are involved in a primarily AI-focused organization. The no-code recommendation system is the ultimate next step towards this.<br></p><p>This kind of simple UI application will make sure that the power of AI is being utilized to its full potential with every techie and non-techie working hand in hand with it.</p><h2>Efficiency and Productivity</h2><p>No-code systems are much more efficient than the traditional methodologies because of their simplicity and easy drag and drop features. If you have the basic knowledge, you will be able to design, develop, or test your recommendation system in much less time as well as less cost and manpower.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Along with that, a small team will be able to build your application using a no-code platform and smaller skill set, while more resources can be focused on bigger more complex ML projects at hand. Thus, it is more efficient as well as increases the productivity of the whole team.</p><p>AI is not just about technology and engineering, but also about art and nuance. People have to go through a lot of heavy lifting to understand the technical aspects. The goal of such no-code recommendation systems is to do that heavy-lifting for you so that you can just focus on the art and nuances of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the whole concept of the no-code recommendation system is still in its infancy, it does show a promising future. We can expect more advanced no-code AI systems in the future and soon, it will be possible to build AI systems with a lot less effort, cost, and other resources.</p></div></div>]]>

Question: Tell me more about Bastille Networks</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley: <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille</span></a><span> is the leader in enterprise threat detection through software-defined radio. Bastille provides full visibility into the known and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/risks-of-cryptojacking-in-mobile-devices/">unknown mobile</a>, wireless, and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/secure-your-iot-devices/">Internet of Things devices</a> inside an enterprise’s corporate airspace–together known as the Internet of Radios. Through its patented software-defined radio and machine learning technology, Bastille senses, identifies, and localizes threats, providing security teams the ability to accurately quantify risk and mitigate airborne threats that could pose a danger to network infrastructure.</span></b></p><h3><b>2. Question: What’s unique and different about Bastille than other solutions/companies?</b></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley</strong>: Until Bastille, there was no way to apply network security mechanisms and countermeasures to RF-enabled IoT devices. IT security professionals couldn’t buy a security service like </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Enterprise</span></a><span> until we invented it.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Question: Can you dive into radio frequency security and why it’s essential for enterprises?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Corporate airspaces are under attack from invisible threats operating on Radio Frequencies (RF). Enterprises are often crucially reliant on wireless protocols, some that they don’t even know they’re using (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.). </span></p><p><span>These protocols are used in building controls and building access, for employee communications, IT, for employees. The exploitation of vulnerable wireless devices is growing increasingly common. Sophisticated attacks use compromised RF devices as their entry points into government and corporate networks. Foreign governments, competitors, and cybercriminals are conducting radio-based attacks on enterprises to access intellectual property and sensitive information.</span></p><h3><strong>4. Question: Can you discuss the importance of why enterprises need to implement and enforce more nuanced electronic device policies to accurately distinguish between approved and unapproved electronic devices in secure areas?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> RF-enabled devices are everywhere: According to Statistica, there are 4.7 billion Cellular phones, 8.4 billion Bluetooth devices, and 9 billion Wi-Fi devices, added to this is the increasing use of “wearables” such as FitBits and other personal devices with embedded radios, with a variety of audio/video capture, pairing and transmission capabilities.</span></p><p><span>Current policies are outdated: While some government and commercial buildings have secure areas where no cell phones or other RF-emitting devices are allowed, detecting and locating radio-enabled devices is largely based on the honor system or one time scans for devices.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span> didnâ€™t really understand the word â€˜graceâ€™ until I swam with manta rays. These placid members of the shark family are the embodiment of grace; winged fish <a href="https://www.mantatrust.org/mobula-alfredi" target="_blank">14 feet</a> across who swoop and somersault with such precision that a manta scooping up plankton at speeds of up to <a href="https://www.deepseanews.com/2013/08/the-superhero-like-swimming-of-manta-rays/" target="_blank">22 miles per hour</a> can graze the hair of a SCUBA diver without touching her head. And as I experienced while diving in Hawaii, if you sit quietly on the ocean floor, theyâ€™ll do it not just once but again and again before disappearing into the blue abyss, as ephemeral as a cloud.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>For both their grace and their sheer otherworldly coolness, people love manta rays. The animals generate $50 million a year from tourists like me who want to swim or dive with them. But given how popular they are, much about mantas remains a mystery. They're truly wild creatures, too big for most aquariums and too far-ranging to easily study. Their life history and migration patterns are little known.&nbsp;No one has ever seen a manta give birth in the wild; we have no idea where they do so.&nbsp;And&nbsp;until&nbsp;recently, scientists thought there was only one kind of&nbsp;manta. It wasnâ€™t until 2009 that&nbsp;the more transient oceanic mantas (<em>Mobula birostris</em>) were recognized as a distinct species from the slightly smaller reef mantas (<em>Mobula alfredi</em>).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>â€œThere are these big, intelligent creatures roaming around and we just donâ€™t know much about them,â€� says&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Andrzejaczek, a shark scientist with the&nbsp;Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237067445_Trends_in_sightings_and_environmental_influences_on_a_coastal_aggregation_of_manta_rays_and_whale_sharks" target="_blank">overfishing</a> has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770565/" target="_blank">reduced</a> some manta populations by <a href="https://saveourseas.com/project-leader/lauren-peel/" target="_blank">80 percent</a>, and the IUCN Red List classifies both species as <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/195459/68632178" target="_blank">Vulnerable</a> and declining. Scientists are now trying to gather the basic information that could help the animals survive. In the process,&nbsp;they're learning that&nbsp;manta rays&nbsp;are more complex and fascinating than anyone imagined—bestowing their grace not just on humans lucky enough to swim with them, but on entire ecosystems.</p>
<blockquote>The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace.</blockquote>
<p>One way mantas shape marine environments is by traveling regularly between the deep ocean and coral reefs. Lauren Peel, a biologist with the Manta Trust and Save Our Seas Foundation, explains that in doing so, mantas move nutrients through the ocean. They eat a certain type of zooplankton that only lives offshore, for example, then return to coral reefs and defecate, depositing a suite of nutrients not otherwise available in the shallow seas.&nbsp;â€œTheyâ€™re essentially fertilizing coral reefs,â€� says Peel, who published a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.190599" target="_blank">2019 study</a> on the discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peel and her colleagues believe this fertilization may <a href="https://saveourseas.com/reef-manta-rays-may-promote-the-growth-of-coral-reefs-in-seychelles/" target="_blank">boost reef growth</a>, which not only leads to a greater biodiversity of corals and sponges but also supports the invertebrates, fish, mammals and reptiles that call reefs home. By analyzing tissue samples from 50 reef mantas and 20 different types of fish in the Seychelles, Peel also found that mantas are the only animals performing this essential fertilization. â€œOn top of being able to move such large distances and access different zooplankton sources, theyâ€™re consistently feeding, so theyâ€™re able to supply a larger amount of nutrients over a larger period of time over a larger spatial scale," Peel says.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Still, the realization that protecting mantas benefits entire coral communities isnâ€™t enough to save the species. Unlike some other imperiled fish, mantas are not targeted by an organized fishery that will grudgingly adhere to conservation measures like bag limits. Instead, mantas are killed by small local fisheries, poachers who sell their gills for traditional Chinese medicine, and commercial fishermen who accidentally take mantas as bycatch. That means the best way to protect them might be through refuges where no fishing is allowed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, keeping poachers out of vast, open marine protected areas (MPAs) is its own challenge. Thatâ€™s one reason why Andrzejaczek analyzed the movement of reef mantas in the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. By showing where mantas hang out, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v639/p137-153/" target="_blank">her data</a> are helping patrol boats better target their policing.</p>
<p>To create adequate marine refuges, scientists must also to figure out how far mantas roam. A <a href="https://mbr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41200-019-0173-6" target="_blank">2019 study</a> showed that one reef manta swam a whopping 714 miles—hundreds of miles farther than the previous known record. Andrzejaczek, on the other hand, found that all 33 tagged mantas in her study stayed within the <a href="http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/7707499/%252523:~:text=On%252525201st%25252520April%252525202010,%25252520the,unrivalled%25252520in%25252520scale%25252520and%25252520significance." target="_blank">200-mile span</a> of the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. Perhaps, she theorizes, some reef mantas migrate long distances while others stay local to a particular reef.</p>
<p>Manta raysâ€™ charisma could play a role in saving them, too. After a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065051" target="_blank">2013 study</a> showed that a live manta can bring $1 million in tourism revenue in over its lifetime, compared to $500 dead, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/21/indonesia-hopes-cash-manta-ray-tourism.html" target="_blank">Indonesia joined</a> Australia, Ecuador, the European Union, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Yap, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Hawaii and Florida in banning manta ray fishing. The Manta Trust is also creating guidelines for sustainable manta ray tourism,&nbsp;like instructing divers to stay calm and let mantas guide the encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>â€œItâ€™s understandable that people get excited,â€� says Annie Murray, a marine biologist with the Manta Trust. â€œBut unfortunately that can lead to people swimming really fast, chasing the manta to try to get the best selfie, and thatâ€™s going to disturb them, especially when theyâ€™re feeding.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_aa7e40c628a36f3002fd99c31b2755ad.jpg" alt="Manta from below"><figcaption><span><strong>Manta from below </strong>No two mantas have the same pattern of underbelly spots, making these invaluable for identifying individuals. </span><br><span>Guy Stevens | Manta Trust</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Murray herself has swam with dozens of mantas, each with distinct personalities. Without prompting, she, Peel and Andrzejaczek each described the animalsâ€™ curiosity and intellect with an awe thatâ€™s rare among scientists.&nbsp;â€œWhen you swim with mantas, itâ€™s an interaction between the two of you,â€� says Murray. â€œThatâ€™s what got me in the beginning. But from a more scientific point of view, Iâ€™m fascinated not only by how they interact with humans, but with each other.â€�<br></p>
<p>Manta rays have the largest brain-to-body ratios of any fish; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z" target="_blank">evidence suggests</a> they might also recognize themselves in mirrors, widely considered a hallmark of human-like self-awareness. She and others are studying how manta raysâ€™ clear intelligence manifests through social behaviors, and whether animals long considered solitary oceanic wanderers actually operate within social networks or hierarchies. While the social research is too new to draw conclusions from, itâ€™s within the realm of possibility that mantas form lifelong social bonds.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more we learn about mantas, the more it calls to mind another definition of grace—â€œthe&nbsp;free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.â€� The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace, a salve that can make even the most cynical scientist weep into her dive mask over the wonder that remains in this wild world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1&nbsp;The mantas I swam with in&nbsp;Hawaii were reef mantas, which have a wingspan of up to 14 feet. Oceanic, or giant, mantas can be nearly 23 feet across.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the last few years I’ve been developing predominantly on Apple
MacBooks. Recently I built myself a
<a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/bestelkosten/2370528">new</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922">PC</a> with a fast
processor and lots of memory. I wanted to move some of my development tasks to
that machine. I still like the freedom that laptops give me to work from
wherever I want. Be it from the couch in my own home or from a random coffee
place in the city where I live, I just like to change environment every few
hours and not sit behind my desk all day long. I hadn’t used Windows as my
primary OS for almost 10 years. But since Windows 10 (still) comes with RDP,
which is better than VNC in terms of performance, and with WSL2, which offers a
“real” and well integrated linux experience, I was curious if I could create a
setup for remotely working on the new machine. It also would give me an
environment to debug Windows specific problems on, which should come in handy
for my side projects like <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/">clj-kondo</a>. If it didn’t work out, I
could always go dual boot with Ubuntu as the primary dev OS and use VNC if I
needed to do anything graphical. For what it is worth, here is a report of
setup process I went through.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pristine smell and beauty of a new PC contrasted with the chaotic reality of my home. <a href="https://t.co/3zLIzYg4XB">pic.twitter.com/3zLIzYg4XB</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Because I had no other Windows machines in my home, I tried creating a USB
Windows installation drive in macOS based on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-make-a-windows-10-usb-using-your-mac-build-a-bootable-iso-from-your-macs-terminal/">this</a>
blog post. No matter what I tried, at the end of the installation process
Windows <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016">would complain</a> with</p>

<blockquote><p>Windows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the

<p>A good friend offered help and created an installation drive using
<a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> on his Windows Home installation, which did work.</p>

<p>Once Windows was installed, I <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access">enabled RDP</a> and installed
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL2</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71">Ubuntu 20.04</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Windows Terminal</a>
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/">Docker Desktop for WSL2</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to run WSL2, I had to enable a virtualization option in my BIOS
first.</p>

<p>I intend to use Ubuntu WSL2 as my primary dev environment on this machine, so it
made sense to tweak the <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1456511/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-default-shell-in-windows-terminal">Terminal configuration</a>
to open Ubuntu by default, instead of PowerShell. I found it annoying that
Ubuntu in Terminal starts in the Windows home directory (<code>/mnt/c/Users/borkdude</code>), so I set <code>"startingDirectory":
"//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/borkdude"</code> in my Ubuntu profile.</p>

<p>I use zsh as my default shell on macOS and wanted that in WSL2 as well so I
installed that using <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install zsh</code> followed by <code>chsh -s $(which
zsh)</code>. I also installed <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> and enabled the
only two plugins I use on a daily basis: <code>git</code> and <code>jump</code>.</p>

<p>Then I started porting the dev setup I use for work on my MacBook, mainly
consisting of Docker images, a couple of Clojure projects, knitted together with
some bash scripts. I use a couple of shell scripts to set all my development
environment variables and aliases for easily setting up ssh tunnels. These
worked after only making a few tweaks (for example, the ethernet card is called
differently in macOS and Ubuntu in WSL2). Of course I needed to install <code>git</code> to
clone my work projects. To run Clojure projects I installed OpenJDK version 8
and 11 via <code>apt</code>. I use <a href="https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/jenv.be">jenv</a> to manage Java versions on a project
basis, which worked perfectly:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
</span><span>jenv add /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Also I installed <a href="https://boot-clj.com/">boot</a>, a Clojure build tool and the
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">Clojure CLI</a> which are all well
supported in linux.</p>

<p>Before running my work projects, I wanted to copy over a PostgreSQL database and
other data from my MacBook using <code>rsync</code>. Before I could do that, I needed to
enable <code>ssh</code> in Ubuntu. I found out I could do this by running <code>sudo service ssh
start</code> but I still could not log in from my MacBook. It turns out you also have
to forward and open up the port in the Windows Firewall. I found
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723">this</a>
PowerShell script that lets you do that. As the comment suggests, I also created
a scheduled task that runs this script upon Windows login. I did the same thing
for running the <code>ssh</code> service using <code>wsl -u root sudo service ssh start</code>. Be
sure to select <code>Run using the highest privileges</code>. I’m sure there is a better
way to do this via <code>systemd</code> in WSL2, but this works for me. So now I could
<code>rsync</code> my the data from macOS to WSL2. I started the Docker containers, the
Clojure projects and it worked! We have a fairly I/O intensive process as part
of our stack, which seems to perform well in WSL2.</p>

<p>Enabling SSH in WSL also lets me use Emacs from my laptop and edit files on the
remote machine using <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">tramp mode</a>. I
ran into one issue with this. Since I use a non-standard prompt in zsh, emacs
tramp could not parse the output from the remote shell. So I added this hack to
my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>case</span> <span>"$TERM"</span> in
</span><span>    <span>"dumb"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>        bash
</span><span><span>esac</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Emacs sets <code>TERM</code> to <code>"dumb"</code> when opening files using <code>tramp</code>. When this is the
case, I just invoke <code>bash</code> instead of continuing with <code>zsh</code>. There may be a
better solution, but this works.</p>

<p>Of course I also wanted to be able to run Emacs on the machine itself. I first
tried to run Emacs in Windows <a href="https://github.com/m-parashar/emax64">natively</a>,
but I read somewhere that editing WSL2 files directly from Windows is not
recommended. Also you might run into the line ending differences between Windows
and linux/macOS. I decided to play it safe and install emacs inside WSL2 using
<code>apt</code>. If you do decide to use the Windows-native Emacs and have trouble finding
where emacs expects configuration files, you can find this using <code>M-x
describe-variable user-init-file</code>. On my machine that was
<code>C:\Users\borkdude\AppData\Roaming\.config\emacs\init.el.</code>. To get a graphical
UI for the emacs started from WSL2, I needed to install an X-server on
Windows. There are plenty of free and open source solutions to choose from, but
I chose to buy
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/x410/9nlp712zmn9q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">X410</a>
on sale for $9.99 instead of $49.99. It seems to be actively worked on and has
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/using-x410-with-wsl2/">good documentation</a>. To
automatically start X410 on Windows startup I followed
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/automatically-start-x410-on-login/">these</a>
instructions. When started, in the tray there is an X icon where you can modify
settings for X410. I have enabled Windowed Apps, Allow Public Access, DPI
Scaling (High Quality) and Shared Clipboard. To export the right <code>DISPLAY</code> value
for GUI applications in WSL2 I have this in my <code>.zshenv</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat /etc/resolv.conf <span>|</span> grep nameserver <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $2; exit;}'</span><span>)</span>:0.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>and then run emacs using <code>setsid emacs</code> from a zsh session (I created an alias
for this in my <code>.zshenv</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using the exact same emacs config I use on macOS, which is based on
<a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">@bbatsov</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">prelude</a>. It looks and feels the same as on
macOS, although now I probably have to learn the “real” emacs keybindings for
copying (<code>M-w</code>) and pasting (<code>C-y</code>) instead of using the macOS keybindings,
which may be in fact a nice side effect of this experiment.</p>

<p>Even connecting to an nREPL server with <code>cider-connect</code> works seemlessly from my
laptop, provided that I forward and open up the port in Windows Firewall like
described above.</p>

<p>Some closing tips.</p>

<p>There is a known <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">issue</a> with
memory usage of WSL2. Since linux uses non-allocated memory for filesystem
caching, Windows thinks this memory is really used. As time goes by, Windows
could end up allocating all your system’s memory to WSL2. To put a limit to
this, I use this config in <code>C:\Users\borkdude\.wslconfig</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>[</span>wsl2<span>]</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>memory</span><span>=</span>92GB
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>My PC has a whopping 128GB of memory so this still leaves 36GB of memory to
Windows.</p>

<p>As I will mainly use this PC for work, I turn it off at night and during the
weekends. To get back where I left, without restarting all my development
processes from scratch, I use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/920730/how-to-disable-and-re-enable-hibernation-on-a-computer-that-is-running">Hibernate</a>
setting.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to set up a VPN between my laptop and
Windows machine so I can connect through RDP, emacs tramp and/or nREPL when I go
outside of my home.</p>

<p>For RDP I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12">Microsoft Remote Desktop.app</a>. Since I have a Retina screen, I enabled the “optimize for Retina displays” setting which gives a better resolution.</p>

<p>As a bonus I can re-use some licenses I already owned for apps I am using on
macOS: Beyond Compare and Acronis True Image.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised with WSL2, the Terminal app and Docker
integration. I’ve only been using this setup for week but so far so good.</p>

    <p>Last week, I talked about <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/repetition-automation-organization-disconnection">repetition, automation, organization, and disconnection</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ever since I started the podcast, I've had to prepare, manually, multiple texts in order to release each episode in various podcast providers—Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast—on the Getting Simple website, and on the newsletter.</p>
<p>Each text was slightly different and editing them by hand wasn't pleasing. I've released dozens of episodes this way.</p>
<p>I've completed a round of code edits I've been working on over the past months to automate most of the tedious work required each time I publish a new episode, and released <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/podcast/latest">a new podcast page layout and audio player</a>.<sup id="fnref:work-or-walk-new-layout"><a href="#fn:work-or-walk-new-layout" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I have individual text boxes for each component of the episode notes, including the episode summary, description, links, credits, release date, duration, and more.</p>
<p>I can now create new episodes with ease and preview the content that will show up on podcast providers, the website, and the newsletter, with the satisfaction of having made it possible on my own instead of relying on other platforms.</p>
<hr>
<p>After more than thirty episodes, repetition removed friction from my podcast-releasing workflow. Yet I won't ever be faster than an automatic system that apart from freeing my time reduces potential human error.</p>
<p>The system I have in place makes my entire episode library highly organized, helping me focus on new content and reducing stress.</p>
<p>Altogether, automated systems such as this one can let us disconnect and reclaim time to be humans.</p>
<p>Whether you continue working or go for walk in the time you get back is on you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so.

However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Flu (influenza) and pneumonia vaccinations are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to new research reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC®) 2020.</p>

<p>Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. </li>
<li>More frequent flu vaccination was associated
with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence.</li>
<li>Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes.</li>
<li>Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold).</li>
</ul>

<p>"With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer.</p>

<p>"It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age."</p>

<h2>Seasonal Flu Vaccine May Reduce Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia</h2>

<p>Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066).</p>

<p>Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p&lt;0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years.</p>

<p>The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's."</p>

<h2>Pneumonia Vaccine May Reduce Alzheimer's Risk later in life.</h2><p>
 Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene.</p>

<p>The researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone.</p>

<p>"Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes."</p>

<h2>Infection Substantially Increases Mortality in People with Dementia</h2>

<p>People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia.</p>

<p>Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit.</p>

<p>"Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.</p>

<p>I enjoy game development as a hobby on the side. I also enjoy working with container schedulers like Kubernetes. Over the weekend I decided to create a Kubernetes game, combining those two thoughts.</p>



<p>In the game you enter and explore nodes in your cluster, and can destroy your very own live, running pods. Hide prod away!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is put together using my engine of choice, Unity. With Unity you code using C#.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-644x387.jpg" alt="3 x Nodes represented in-game from my Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster." srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-644x387.jpg 644w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kube-nodes-arm-from-pi-k8s-cluster-in-game.jpg 1073w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"><figcaption>3 x Nodes represented in-game from my Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. Can you spot the naming convention from one of my favourite movies?</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Game Logic</h2>



<p>The game logic was simple to put together. I have a couple of modular systems I’ve already developed (and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="actually sell (opens in a new tab)" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/2d-shooter-bullet-and-weapon-system-19922" target="_blank">actually sell</a> on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Unity Asset Store (opens in a new tab)" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/2d-neon-grids-171218" target="_blank">Unity Asset Store</a>), so those made the movement and shooting logic, as well as background grid effects a breeze.</p>



<p>Movement is implemented in a simple ‘twin-stick’ controller <strong>Script </strong>(a Unity concept, which is a class implementing <code>Monobehaviour</code>).</p>



<p>Other game logic is mostly contained in the bullet pattern module. I have some more Scripts that arrange and control the Kubernetes entities as well as their labels.</p>



<p>The interaction with Kubernetes itself is fairly hacked together. I wanted to put the game together as quickly as possible as I only worked on it over a couple of weekend evenings.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton-300x262.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton-300x262.jpg 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/csharp-kubemanager-singleton.jpg 631w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption>Let the hacky code flow…</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Unity is a bit behind in .NET Framework version support and .NET Core was out of the question. This meant using the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kubernetes csharp client (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client/csharp" target="_blank">Kubernetes csharp client</a> was not going to happen easily (directly in Unity that is). It would have been my first choice otherwise.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I skipped over to a hacky solution of invocating the kubectl client directly from within the game.</p>



<p>The game code executes <code>kubectl</code>commands on threads separate to the main game loop and returns the results formatted accordingly, back to the game’s main thread. I used <code>System.Diagnostics.Process</code> for this.</p>



<p>From there, game entities are instantiated and populated with info and labels. (E.g. the nodes and the pods).</p>

<h3>Pods have health</h3>



<p>Pods are given health (hit points) and they simply bounce around after spawning in. You can chase after and shoot them, at which point a <code>kubectl destroy pod</code> command is actually sent to the Kube API via kubectl!</p>



<h2>The game world</h2>



<p>You enter the world in a ‘node’ view, where you can see all of your cluster’s nodes. From there you can approach nodes to have them slide open a ‘door’. Entering the door transports you ‘into’ the node, where you can start destroying pods at will.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mniUTN5.gif" alt="gif animation of player entering a node"></figure></div>



<p>For obvious reasons I limit the pods that are destroyable to a special ‘demo’ namespace.</p>



<h2>Putting together the demo pods</h2>



<p>I use a great little tool called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="arkade (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade" target="_blank">arkade</a> in my Kubernetes Pi cluster.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm-300x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm-300x300.png 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm-150x150.png 150w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/arkade-logo-sm.png 544w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption>arkade makes it really simple to install apps into your cluster. Great for quick POCs and demos.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Arkade offers a small library of useful and well thought out apps that are simple to install. The CLI provides strongly-typed flags to install these apps (or any helm charts) in short, one-line operations.</p>



<p>It also handles the logic around figuring out which platform you’re running on, and pulling down the correct images for that platform (if supported). Super useful when you’re on ARM as you are with the Raspberry Pi.</p>



<p>Straight from the <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade#get-arkade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GitHub page (opens in a new tab)">GitHub page</a>, this is how simple it is to setup:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Note: you can also run without `sudo` and move the binary yourself
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade --help
ark --help  # a handy alias

# Windows users with Git Bash
curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh</pre>



<p>I then went about installing a bunch of apps and charts with arkade. For example:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">arkade install loki --namespace demo</pre>



<h2>Hooking the game up to my Kube Cluster</h2>



<p>With the demo namespace complete, and the application pods running, I needed to get my Windows machine running the game talking to my Pi Cluster (on another local network).</p>



<p>I have a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pi 'router' (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/kubernetes/building-a-raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-1-routing/" target="_blank">Pi ‘router’</a> setup that is perfectly positioned for this. All that is required is to run a kube proxy on this, listening on 0.0.0.0 and accepting all hosts.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">kubectl proxy --address='0.0.0.0' --port=8001 --accept-hosts='.*'</pre>



<p>I setup a local kube config pointing to the router’s local IP address on the interface facing my Windows machine’s network, and switched context to that configuration.</p>



<p>From there, the game’s kubectl commands get sent to this context and traverse the proxy to hit the kube API. </p>



<p>Destroying pods sure does exercise those <strong>ReplicaSets</strong>!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rs-destruction.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rs-destruction-644x201.png" alt="ReplicaSets spinning up new pods as quickly as they're destroyed in-game!" srcset="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rs-destruction-644x201.png 644w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rs-destruction-300x93.png 300w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rs-destruction-768x239.png 768w, https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rs-destruction.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>ReplicaSets spinning up new pods as quickly as they’re destroyed in-game!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Source</h2>



<p>If there is any interest, I would be happy to publish the (hacky) source for the main game logic and basic logic that sends the kubectl processes off to other threads.</p>

            <p>You can try it out for yourself using this link <a href="https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com/">https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com</a> - just hold a Sudoku puzzle up to your WebCam. Or try it on your mobile phone - it should work pretty well in a mobile browser.</p>

<p>A long time ago I wrote an app for the iPhone that let you take a grab a sudoku puzzle using your iPhone’s camera.</p>

<p>Recently, when I was investigating my <a href="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/2020/06/05/self-organising-ws2811-leds.html">self organising Christmas lights project</a> I realised that the browser APIs and ecosystem had advanced to the point that it was probably possible to recreate the system running purely in the browser.</p>

<p>As you can see it works pretty well:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOC-ad0BsY0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As always, all the code is on GitHub for you to try out for yourself: <a href="https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku">https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku</a></p>

<p>It’s good to start with a simple definition of the problem we are trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given an image identify and extract the Sudoku puzzle, recognise the numbers in each cell, solve the puzzle, render the results on top of the original image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/1-puzzle.jpg" alt="Puzzle Image"></p>

<p>As a classically trained image processing guy, my first port of call is to remove redundant information.</p>

<p>We don’t care about colours, so we’ll convert the image to greyscale. As you can see we’ve not lost any useful information.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/2-greyscale.jpg" alt="Greyscale Image"></p>

<p>Looking at the image, we only ready care about paper and ink, so it makes sense to binarise the image and make black or white.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/3-thresholded.png" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Next, we need to identify the blob that is the puzzle. Once we’ve got that we can extract the image of the puzzle and extract the contents of each box of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/4-located.jpg" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Apply some OCR to the contents of each box, solve the puzzle and our job is done.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/6-solved.png" alt="Solved Puzzle"></p>

<p>It’s a pretty straightforward image processing pipeline!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/7-pipeline.jpg" alt="Pipeline"></p>

<p>Let’s dive into each of these steps in turn and see how they work.</p>



<p>We’re taking a feed from the camera on the device. This comes into us as an RGB image. We’re not really interested in colour as we’re working with printed puzzles which will typically by printed in black and white.</p>

<p>So our first step is to convert from RGB to greyscale.</p>

<p>If we look at the standard formula for this we get this fomula <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s interesting about this is that a large portion of the value is coming from the green channel. So we can apply a little shortcut to our RGB to greyscale conversion and just take the green channel of the image.</p>



<p>We’re going to use morphological operations for locating the puzzle - typically these work on black and white binary images, so our next step is binarise our image.</p>

<p>This involves applying a threshold to seperate out foreground from background pixels.</p>

<p>Trying to apply a global threshold to the image can result in very poor results - especially when lighting conditions are not good.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/8-global-threshold.jpg" alt="Global Threshold"></p>

<p>However, if we look at a small section of the image we can see from the histogram that we do have an obvious collection of ink pixels and paper pixels.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/9-local-threshold-hist.jpg" alt="Local Area Histogram"></p>

<p>What we want to do is examine each pixel in the context of its surrounding area.</p>

<p>A simple way to do this is to apply a blur to the image and then compare the original image with this blurred image.</p>

<p>Doing this gives us a very clean segmented image even when lighting conditions are not ideal</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/A-local-thresholded.jpg" alt="Local Threshold"></p>



<p>We’ve now got a fairly clean image that contains our puzzle along with a bunch of random other printed elements. Typically you’d jump straight in here with something like a hough transform to detect lines. However we can be a bit smarter about what we are doing and take a bit of a shortcut.</p>

<p>We know that whoever is taking the picture should be pointing the camera at a puzzle. So we can assume that the puzzle would be the largest object in the image and also have the most number of pixels. We can also apply other heuristics such as aspect ratio to filter out elements that probably aren’t a puzlle.</p>

<p>If we scan the image pulling out all connected components the connected component that contains the puzzle should be the one with the most points.</p>

<p>Doing this lets us isolate the puzzle grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/B-located.png" alt="Located Puzzle"></p>



<p>With the puzzle grid identified we now need to identify the four corners of the puzzle. Once again we can apply a fairly simple heuristic to this problem. The pixels that are in the four corners should have the smallest manhatten distance from the corners of the max extents of the extracted component.</p>

<p>Runing this algorithm for all four extents of our located puzzle gives us the four corners.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/D-corners.png" alt="Puzzle Corners"></p>



<p>We know where the puzzle is in our image. We have the location of the four corner points.</p>

<p>To extract the puzzle image we formulate our problem into one of a homographic transform.</p>

<p>We want to map from the camera image of the puzzle to an ideal image of the puzzle that is not distorted by perpective or rotations.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography.png" alt="Mapping from flat image to camera image"></p>

<p>We do this by computing a homography between the two planes. The formula shown can be transformed into this - as you can see we need four points - this maps nicely onto the corner points that we’ve already located.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography2.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>If we rewrite the matrices algebraically we can find h using this algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography3.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>You can find more details on how to do this here - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/">https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/</a></p>

<p>Now that we have the homography between our ideal image and the camera image we can map pixels between images.</p>

<p>This gives us a nice square puzzle image from the camera image.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/F-extracted.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>Once we’ve got the square puzzle image we need to extract the contents of each individual cell. We can use the thresholded version of the image for this.</p>

<p>Looking at each box in turn we extract the bounds of any connected region starting from the center of each cell. We can then use this bounds to extract an image from the square greyscale image.</p>

<p>If there is no connected region in the center of the cell then we know that it is empty.</p>

<p>We now have an image for each populated cell of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/G-boxes.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>We’re going to use a neural network to perform OCR on each image. I’m going to use TensorFlow to train the network and then TensorFlow js to run the network in the browser.</p>

<p>Our neural network is going to be trained to recognise the digits 1 through 9.</p>

<p>I’ve synthesized a large number of training examples from a wide selection of fonts rendering a greyscale image of each digit.</p>

<p>I’ve added a small amount of blur and some Gaussian noise to each image. Hopefully this will provide a reasonable representation of what we will be getting in a live environment.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training"></p>

<p>I’ve also sparated out 10% of the images into a testing data set that we can use to evaluate how well our network performs.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>I’m using an interactive Jupyter notebook to train the network - this is available in the GitHub repository. You’ll also find more information on the training in the YouTube video.</p>

<p>I perform some image normalisation and resize the input images to 20 by 20 pixels - we need to remember to also do this in the javascript code so that it matches.</p>

<p>I’m also augmenting our training data to help the network generalise. This will add some random mutations to our input data set.</p>

<p>Running the training we can see that we have pretty good accuracy on both training and validation.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the confusion matrix we can see that “1”s and “7”s are currently getting confused.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training3.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the failed images I’m pretty happy with the performance. I think the fonts that it is failing on would not be used in the real world so I’m happy to ignore these failures.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training5.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>As I’m happy with the neural network structure I’m going to train it on all the data and use the resulting network in my production code.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training6.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>



<p>We can solve a sudoku puzzle using Donald Knuth’s application of Dancing Links to his Algorithm X for solving the exact cover problem.</p>

<p>Dancing links uses the seemingly very simple realisation that we can remove and put back nodes from a doubly linked list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX1.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>We can see that when we remove node B from the list it still has pointers back to the nodes that used to link to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX2.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>This means that node B contains all the information required to add it back into the list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX3.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>I go into more detail in the video around Algorithm X and you can find a good description in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">WikiPedia artical</a>.</p>

<p>Dancing links solves the problem of backtracking in an efficient way.</p>

<p>We can encode the sparse matrix used by Algorithm X as a doubly linked circular list going left and right for the rows and up and down for the columns.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX4.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>Since these are now linked lists we can use fact that we can efficiently remove and re-add elements to perform the column and row removals and to backtrack if needed.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this algorithm by recoding our sudoku puzzle as an exact coverage problem. Translating a puzzle into a set of constraints gives us a sparse matrix of 729 rows by 324 columns.</p>

<p>Here’s what a sudoku puzzle looks like when turned into a set of constraints.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX5.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>



<p>To render our results we could draw our text into a square image and then project each pixel onto the image coming from the camera. This would be quite computationally intensive.</p>

<p>Alternatively for each puzzle cell we could take an imaginary line through the center of each cell. We can then project that using our homographic transform and use this project line to calculate an approximate height and angle for the cell.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering.png" alt="Approximate Digit Angle And Size"></p>

<p>We then simply draw the text at the projected location of the cell with the calculated height and angle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering2.jpg" alt="Rendered Solution"></p>

<p>Checkout the video to see how well it works along with a lot more detail of all these steps:</p>

        <p><em>But why?</em> you are wondering. You must be given some context: this is an experiment <a href="https://github.com/franciscop/create-static-web">inside another experiment I'm doing</a> to learn about Static Site Generators. PHP is the first language I knew well and I wanted to test whether it's a horrible or just a bad idea to use it for templates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you come from Google trying to find how to run PHP inside Javascript, you are very likely lost. Beware, this article is only for experts! <a title="the '/s' stands for 'sarcasm'" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%2Fs">/s</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since a large motivator for my site generator is to rely purely on Node.js and <em>not</em> to have to install Ruby, I also don't want to install PHP! But can you run PHP inside Javascript? I only need the most basic PHP features: variables, echo, loops.</p>
<p>The sarcastic language of this article might be deceiving, but there is <strong><a href="#demo">a working demo below</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="initial-objective">Initial objective</h2>
<p>The idea came when I was making FrontMatter work properly for the current file. It is also related to my general dissatisfaction with the Node.js template engines, but that a topic for another day:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Running PHP in Javascript
---
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{{title}}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta content="{{title}}" property="og:title" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It reminded me quite a bit to what can be achieved with raw PHP:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;? $title = "Running PHP in Javascript"; ?&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&lt;?= $title ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta content="&lt;?= $title ?&gt;" property="og:title" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="googling-around">Googling around</h2>
<p>Google just led me to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=run+php+inside+javascript">780 StackOverflow questions</a> with <code>-1</code> average score. After reading some, I believe the average score should be more like <code>-5</code>. I also learned that devs are trying to do:</p>
<pre><code>alert("&lt;?= "Hello world" ?&gt;");</code></pre>
<p>As an astute reader might notice, that is supposed to run first through the PHP server, <em>then</em> sent to the browser and finally run the resulting <code>alert("Hello world")</code> on the client. But this level of sophistication is too high, I just want to run raw PHP on the browser! I want something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// No server needed, "just" Javascript parsing PHP
alert(php(`&lt;?= "Hello world" ?&gt;`));</code></pre>
<p>But not even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/search?q=php">Reddit's "PHP" search</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atwoodslaw/"> <code>r/atwoodslaw</code></a> could find what I seek.</p>
<h2 id="promising-finds">Promising finds</h2>
<p>After getting lucky with a <em>"PHP parser Javascript"</em> search, I end up finding the package <a href="https://github.com/glayzzle/php-parser"><code>php-parser</code> in Github/npm</a>. The problem is that the output is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em></a>. I just wanted to run the code, not whatever an abstract tree seems to be:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/abstract-architecture-art-artistic-262577/"><img src="https://francisco.io/blog/running-php-in-javascript/abstract-tree.q50.jpg" alt="An abstract tree somehow"></a></p>
<p>Since you are reading this it means that in the <a href="https://github.com/glayzzle/php-parser#related-projects"><em>Related Projects</em></a> category I found my next clue. I head to the website with the <span title="I know, it's a tanuki ;)">funny looking cat</span>: <a href="https://gitlab.com/kornelski/babel-preset-php"><code>babel-preset-php</code></a>. It transpiles PHP into Javascript 🎉</p>
<p>Since babel is in total chaos with the whole <code>babel-loader</code> vs <code>@babel/loader</code> and no one knows which one is which (ironic, innit?), I give up and take a break. I do practice <a href="https://core.cards/">my Kanjis</a>, speak with my family in Spanish and think about the English title for this article.</p>
<h2 id="building-up-the-library">Building up the library</h2>
<p>Fresh again, I scavenge the library <code>babel-preset-php</code> for my project. I am now using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>php-parser</code> to transform the PHP into the Abstract Tree thing.</li>
<li><code>babel-preset-php</code> ravaged files to do something that I have no idea what it is but it's the only way to keep it working.</li>
<li><code>@babel/generator</code> to finally generate the Javascript from the previous step.</li>
<li>A bit of Javascript. I use the fancier <code>new Function()</code> to pretend it's better than <code>eval()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn't going to show you, but since my code is so tiny thanks to those great libraries I can just paste it here for your satisfaction:</p>
<pre><code>import parser from 'php-parser';
import translator from './translator';
import generator from '@babel/generator';

const run = (code, opts) =&gt; {
  // Make a closure so that `out` doesn't collide with the PHP variables:
  let out = '';
  // Define `echo` since it's used in the transpiled JS code for some reason
  opts.echo = opts.echo || (str =&gt; out += str);
  // Pretend this is safe. Pro tip: IT IS NOT SAFE
  new Function(...Object.keys(opts), code)(...Object.values(opts));
  return out;
}

export default function (src, opts = {}) {
  const ast = new parser().parseCode(src);
  const file = translator.translateProgram(ast);
  const code = generator(file).code;
  return run(code, opts);
};</code></pre>
<p>Later on I will export some individual parts for better testing, but that is really all there is to it.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>The long-awaited demo! Turn your internet off, hide your kids and say your prayers. I already loaded <a href="https://francisco.io/blog/running-php-in-javascript/php.min.js">the <code>php()</code> function</a> for you, but are you <em>ready</em> to run it?</p>

<form id="horrible">


</form>


<p>Tips to make the demo better for <a href="https://documentation.agency/">lack of documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">backticks</a> as the first argument of <code>php()</code> to allow for any quote type and multi line.</li>
<li>Provide a second argument as a plain object like <code>{ hello: 'world' }</code> to define the variable <code>$hello</code> with the value <code>"world"</code> inside the PHP code.</li>
<li>If you want to run it with express use <code>{ _GET: req.query, _POST: req.body }</code> as the second argument (do <em>not</em> do it, specially on a live server).</li>
<li>You could pass <code>window</code> as the second argument as well if you prefer PHP instead of Javascript. Heck, you could make a tool that finds and runs all <code>&lt;script src="ohmy.php"  type="application/php"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>I am running <code>eval()</code> against your code. The php() function is basically running <code>eval()</code> internally. Do I get a "Go to Jail card" for basically doing <code>eval(eval(...))</code>?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>
<p>Yup, this sucks. Use it just as an example of things that should never happen. If you <em>really, really</em> need to use this, and want more features, feel free to throw me loads of money and I might consider talking you out of it or contacting the relevant health authorities.</p>
<p>Now that we have reached this point and seeing how many languages have AST generators, I ponder: can <em>any</em> language be transpiled to Javascript? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY-pUxKQMUE">Should we do it?</a> Webassembly is going to eat JS so we might just give it a try!</p>
<p>If you hate PHP, or Javascript, and you <em>really</em> want to let me and others know<a title="You want to feel like you belong, but spreading hate on PHP won't change the fact that no one really likes you...">*</a> feel free to comment on Hacker News:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>So <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> came out while I wasn't looking last week. The
GnuTLS advisory (<a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03</a>) is pretty opaque so I'll
refer instead to <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1270061316368224256">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> (Go team
security lead):</p>

<blockquote><p>PSA: don't rely on GnuTLS, please.</p>

<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> Whoops, for the past 10 releases most TLS 1.0–1.2
connection could be passively decrypted and most TLS 1.3 connections
intercepted. Trivially.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/">TLS 1.2–1.0 session tickets are awful</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are reading this correctly: supposedly encrypted TLS connections
made with affected GnuTLS releases are vulnerable to <em>passive</em>
cleartext recovery attack (and active for 1.3, but who uses that
anyways). That is extremely bad. It's pretty close to just switching
everyone to HTTP instead of HTTPS, more or less. I would have a lot
more to say about the security of GnuTLS in particular -- and security
in general -- but I am mostly concerned about patching holes in the
roof right now, so this article is not about that.</p>

<p>This article is about figuring out what, exactly, was exposed in our
infrastructure because of this.</p>






<p>Assuming you're running Debian, this will show a list of packages that
<code>Depends</code> on GnuTLS:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you run this only on hosts running Buster or
above. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to pick machines
running GnuTLS 3.6.4 or later.</p>

<p>Note that this list only <em>first level</em> dependencies! It is perfectly
possible that another package uses GnuTLS without being listed
here. For example, in the above list I have <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code>, so the
be really thorough, I would actually need to recurse down the
dependency tree.</p>

<p>On my desktop, this shows an "interesting" list of targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
<li><code>cadaver</code> - AKA WebDAV</li>
<li><code>curl</code> &amp; <code>wget</code></li>
<li><code>fwupd</code> - another attack on top of <a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md">this one</a></li>
<li><code>git</code> (through the <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code> dependency)</li>
<li><code>mutt</code> - all your emails</li>
<li><code>weechat</code> - your precious private chats</li>
</ul>


<p>Arguably, fetchers like <code>apt</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>fwupd</code>, and <code>wget</code> rely on HTTPS for
"authentication" more than secrecy, although <code>apt</code> has its own
OpenPGP-based authentication so that wouldn't matter anyways. Still,
this is truly distressing. And I haven't mentioned here things like
<code>gobby</code>, <code>network-manager</code>, <code>systemd</code>, and others - the scope of this is
broad. Hell, even good old <code>lynx</code> links against GnuTLS.</p>

<p>In our infrastructure, the magic command looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cumin -o txt -p 0  'F:lsbdistcodename=buster' "apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u" | tee gnutls-rdepds-per-host | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>There, the result is even more worrisome, as those important packages seem to rely on GnuTLS for their transport security:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mariadb</code> - all MySQL traffic and passwords</li>
<li><code>mandos</code> - full disk encryption</li>
<li><code>slapd</code> - LDAP passwords</li>
</ul>


<p><code>mandos</code> is especially distressing although it's probably not
vulnerable because it seems it doesn't store the cleartext -- it's
encrypted with the client's OpenPGP public key -- so the TLS tunnel
never sees the cleartext either.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/1270078914996682753">Other reports</a> have also mentioned the following servers link
against GnuTLS and could be vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exim</code></li>
<li><code>rsyslog</code></li>
<li><code>samba</code></li>
<li>various <code>VNC</code> implementations</li>
</ul>




<p>Those programs are not affected by this vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apache2</code></li>
<li><code>gnupg</code></li>
<li><code>python</code></li>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>openssh</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This list is not exhaustive, naturally, but serves as an example of
common software you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>The vulnerability only exists in GnuTLS, as far as we know, so
programs linking against other libraries are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Because the vulnerability affects session tickets -- and those are set
on the server side of the TLS connection -- only users of GnuTLS as a
server are vulnerable. This means, for example, that while <code>weechat</code>
uses GnuTLS, it will only suffer from the problem when acting as a
server (which it does, in relay mode) or, of course, if the remote IRC
server also uses GnuTLS. Same with apt, curl, wget, or git: it is
unlikely to be a problem because it is only used as a client; the
remote server is usually a webserver -- not git itself -- when using
TLS.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it's not because a package links against GnuTLS that
it <em>uses</em> it. For example, I have been told that, on Arch Linux, if
both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are available, the <code>mutt</code> package will use the
latter, so it's not affected. I haven't confirmed that myself nor have I
checked on Debian.</p>

<p>Also, because it relies on session tickets, there's a time window
after which the ticket gets cycled and properly initialized. But that
is <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1270054740559384576">apparently 6 hours by default</a> so it is going to protect only
really long-lasting TLS sessions, which are uncommon, I would argue.</p>

<p>My audit is limited. For example, it might have been better to walk
the shared library dependencies directly, instead of relying on Debian
package dependencies.</p>



<p>It seems the vulnerability might have been introduced in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/695">this merge
request</a>, itself following a (entirely reasonable) <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/184">feature request
to make it easier to rotate session tickets</a>. The merge request was
open for a few months and was thoroughly reviewed by a peer before
being merged. Interestingly, the vulnerable function
(<code>_gnutls_initialize_session_ticket_key_rotation</code>), explicitly says:</p>

<pre><code> * This function will not enable session ticket keys on the server side. That is done
 * with the gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() function. This function just initializes
 * the internal state to support periodical rotation of the session ticket encryption key.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it thinks it is not responsible for session ticket
initialization, yet it is. Indeed, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275/">merge request fixing the
problem</a> unconditionally does this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(session-&gt;key.initial_stek, key-&gt;data, key-&gt;size);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't reviewed the code and the vulnerability in detail, so take
the above with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275.patch">full patch is available here</a>. See also the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011">upstream issue
1011</a>, the <a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">upstream advisory</a>, the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777">Debian security
tracker</a>,
and the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843723">Redhat Bugzilla</a>.</p>



<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the affected packages and
how they are used. It can range from "meh, someone knows I downloaded
that Debian package yesterday" to "holy crap my full disk encryption
passwords are compromised, I need to re-encrypt all my drives",
including "I need to change all LDAP and MySQL passwords".</p>

<p>It promises to be a fun week for some people at least.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, one has to wonder whether we should follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a>'s advice and stop using GnuTLS altogether. There are
at least a few programs that link against GnuTLS because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing">OpenSSL licensing oddities</a> but that has been first announced in
2015, then <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/">definitely and clearly resolved in 2017</a> -- or <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/top-foss-legal-developments">maybe
that was in 2018</a>? Anyways it's fixed, pinky-promise-I-swear,
except if you're one of those weirdos still using GPL-2, of
course. Even though OpenSSL isn't the simplest and secure TLS
implementation out there, it could preferable to GnuTLS and maybe we
should consider changing Debian packages to use it in the future.</p>

<p>But then again, the last time something like this happened, it was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> and GnuTLS wasn't affected, so who knows... It is
likely that people don't have OpenSSL in mind when they suggest moving
away from GnuTLS and instead think of other TLS libraries like
<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedtls</a> (previously known as PolarSSL), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a>, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a>,
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and so on. Not that those are totally sinless either...</p>

<p>"This is fine", as they say...</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>It works well with very satisfying returnings. But the time complexity was pretty bad. In the <code>while</code> loop, it checks if the element to be inserted exists in the new array for each of the loop round.

        <p>2020-07-26</p>

        <p>We’ve been doing a lot of mob programming at work the last year or so and I’ve seen that I have a different attitude to naming things than others on my team. When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</p>

<p>I also saw something related recently when doing a programming course internally at work. I sat and helped a guy with an issue he was having. I saw a really bad variable name and recommended he change it. He said “later, I just need to fix this first”. I pushed the point once more saying “trust me” and then left him to his devices. A few minutes later he asked for help again, being totally stuck. Renaming the variable got him immediately unstuck. He had wasted lots of time because the name put him in a mental trap.</p>

<p>My philosophy is: <em>there are only two acceptable types of names: good names and metasyntactic names</em>. If you have a name that is bad or just a bit misleading it’s better to rename it to <code>foo</code> NOW.</p>

<p>I believe good (or metasyntactic) names lead to easier problem solving and less effort in programming. It’s not just something we add at the end to make the code more understandable to others or future you. To me the primary thing we work with in programming isn’t numbers or computation, but language.</p>

  <p><span>This essay was co-authored by <a href="https://kortina.nyc/">Andrew Kortina</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel">Namrata Patel</a>.</span></p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/04-kinky-labor-supply.png"><figcaption>Kinky (S<sub>1</sub>) vs classical (S<sub>0</sub>) labor supply curve.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment. In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.</p>

<p>At the macro level, this results in sub-optimal production, as firms are unable to satisfy their demand for labor via the usual mechanism of increasing wages. If you believe that economic productivity and growth are good, this presents a challenge when attempting to design stimulus policy, because subsidies or increases to the minimum wage would yield the same non-result as firms increasing wages. We discuss the potential efficacy of the somewhat radical idea of a tax on human attention or time spent consuming entertainment media as a way to stimulate productivity.</p>

<h3 id="declining-labor-participation-in-younger-demographics">Declining Labor Participation in Younger Demographics</h3>

<p>The overall labor force participation rate in the United States has been declining for the past several decades. The most obvious potential explanation would be an aging population (retirees comprising an increasing percentage of the overall population), but you can see this is not the root cause when you break out the labor force participation rate by age and sex:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/00-labor-participation.png"><figcaption>Labor Participation Rate via <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Labor participation has been dropping much faster for young men than any other groups. <em>(Interestingly, labor participation has been increasing most rapidly for older demographics, presumably because they must continue working later in life in order to support basic needs and healthcare costs).</em></p>

<p>In <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maguiar/files/leisure-luxuries-labor-june-2017.pdf">Leisure Luxuries and the Labor Supply of Young Men</a>, Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite stagnant wages, declining employment rates, and an increased propensity to live with their parents, younger men report increased happiness during the 2000s. This contrasts sharply with older men, whose satisfaction fell along with their relative earnings. We see the life satisfaction results as indirect evidence that younger men experienced relatively little decline in the consumption and greatly valued their improved leisure options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of young men’s time which in past decades was spent working is now spent playing video games, according to Aguiar and Hurst. Given that reported happiness moved in the opposite direction from wages and employment rate, it would seem there is some preference for this specific type of leisure over the purchasing power sacrificed in the form of foregone wages. But given that leisure activities have always been an alternative to work, we should ask what about video games specifically makes them more compelling than historical leisure activities.</p>



<h3 id="decreasing-cost-increasing-availability-and-increasing-quality-of-media-entertainment">Decreasing Cost, Increasing Availability, and Increasing Quality of Media Entertainment</h3>

<p>Video games are just one example of media entertainment content that has become more a more attractive leisure choice as a result of advances in internet and mobile device technology.</p>

<p>For most of history, media consumption was bounded, like other forms of consumption, by cost – if you wanted more books, movies, music, console video games, etc, you needed money to buy them. Notable exceptions to this pattern were radio and cable television, where you could access programming at all hours of the day for a low fixed cost (or in some cases for free) – but in these cases, limits on the syndication of premium content entailed that not every hour of watching was equally enjoyable, and there were generally still diminishing (enjoyment) returns on each additional hour spent watching.</p>

<p>The digitization of content enabled infinite storage of evergreen content in the cloud and effectively zero marginal distribution cost of content through copying. Enabling on-demand access to all of the content that has ever been produced entailed a huge increase in the supply of good content. This essentially made all of history a viable competitor to people producing new content. Similarly, social media–produced for free, by amateurs–provided another huge influx of new content and more competition for attention.</p>

<p>This increased supply and competition put pressure on professionals creating new content to make it better and cheaper. On top of that, taking a page from the cable TV playbook, internet media distributors gave away content for free, and used advertising subsidies to pay for the small amount of content that was still being professionally produced.</p>

<p>All of these changes benefited the consumer by making more and better content available for free. Today, you can pretty much always spend yet another hour consuming some new and interesting content freely available on the internet, so once you have paid the (quite cheap) cost of access to your ISP or mobile data provider, you no longer require additional wages to pay for additional consumption of media as a leisure activity.</p>

<h3 id="decreasing-signalling-utility-of-conspicuous-consumption-goods">Decreasing Signalling Utility of Conspicuous Consumption Goods</h3>

<p>Before we accept that young men are simply foregoing working in favor of spending more time playing video games or consuming other forms of media entertainment content, we should ask what else they might spend foregone earnings on and why they are not working to fund that spend.</p>

<p>In general there are three types of goods: goods that meet your basic needs, leisure goods (including media goods), and conspicuous consumption goods (those that signal genetic fitness, social status, belonging, etc.). If young men playing video games are not foregoing their basic needs (an assumption we’ll make here), and the cost of media entertainment goods has dramatically fallen, then they must be trading off consumption goods. Next, we argue that this group has decreased consumption because the signaling utility of these goods has decreased.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-conspicuous-consumption-and-what-does-it-take-to-get-it">What is conspicuous consumption and what does it take to get it?</h4>

<p>Historically, the primary purpose of working was to generate enough income to satisfy basic needs. Once those needs were met, an individual had a tradeoff to make between spending their remaining time on work or leisure.</p>

<p>Observing the behavior of the nouveau riche in a post-industrialization society in the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen introduced the theory of conspicuous consumption - the purchase of goods and services for the sake of signalling social status (vs. the intrinsic function provided by goods that meet basic needs or those that enable leisure).</p>

<p>As living standards improved in the 20th century and individuals had more discretionary income, this behavior expanded to men, women, and children across all economic classes who began to spend more money on goods and services as a sort of social fashion. Implicit in spending more time on work is a preference for conspicuous consumption over leisure.</p>

<p>If you have the money, how do you decide what to consume? Benjamin Schwarz suggested in his <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-new-elites-silly-virtue-signaling-consumption/">review</a> of Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Small-Things-Theory-Aspirational/dp/0691162735">The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This process depends on the great extent to which the elite’s consumption is at once devoted to and relies on “cultural capital”—that is, the adoption of values, tastes, and norms through social inculcation and formal education. That cup of Intelligentsia coffee may “only” cost five dollars, but learning about it in the first place depends on prizing the judgment of certain cultural tastemakers (again, say, the New York Times and those right-thinking podcasts), and on possessing a worldview that attaches a particular value and virtue to a particular container of hot liquid. Acquiring that cultural capital is, itself, a rarefied and usually expensive endeavor, because it involves a lengthy and complex process of what the sociologists call cultural and social formation: The peculiar cachet that the educated class attaches to that cup of coffee is far more likely to elude the daughter of an insurance adjuster brought up in Lansing, Kansas (a middle-class suburb of Kansas City), who attended the local high school and Kansas State, than it is the daughter of a screenwriter raised in uber-achieving north-of-Montana-Avenue Santa Monica, who attended the Harvard-Westlake School and Yale. Thus, buying that cup of coffee—or that organic cotton t-shirt, or that subscription to Harper’s—signifies a class identity that the purchase, in turn, reinforces.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increased cost in time to acquire the knowledge of what to consume is yet another way that conspicuous consumption is becoming prohibitively more expensive.</p>

<p>The catch with all of this is that the psychological utility sought from conspicuous consumption is relative, not absolute. Sarah Perry sums this up nicely in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290">Every Cradle is a Grave</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than anything, however, a human utility function is a function of social belonging. That’s the ultimate point not only of income, but of intelligence, beauty, and many other material and non-material goods: they may be traded for social belonging… We want income because we want to be able to get the attention of others. We want a safe social place, primarily—and, of course, we want a better social place than the one we currently occupy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication of this relative sizing up is that there is an ever-rising bar to maintain or improve your social position relative to the people and communities from which you seek affiliation or belonging. This was never easy given the money and time required, but at least …</p></article></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Ever since&nbsp;Google&nbsp;published the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="SRE movemen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/06/26/cloud-service-reliability-part-i-apollo-13-to-google-sre/" target="_blank">SRE movemen</a>t has changed how organizations look at&nbsp;reliability, and incident response and management. Not unlike DevOps, working on adopting SRE is resulting in an organizational cultural shift. A shift which is changing how organizations are organized, on how information flows within an organization that would allow for the delivery of more reliable and resilient, dynamic systems. That being said, SRE, that is SRE as defined by Google, is not applicable for most organizations. Organizations need to take the thought process and culture behind Google’s SRE and adapt it just enough to make it suitable and viable for their organization’s business needs. As I see it today, large enterprises are mostly failing at doing this. They are either attempting to adopt SRE in its purest form, not realizing they are not Google, or totally changing (corrupting) it to suit how they do things, how they have always done things, to their broken culture, hence making what they call SRE, SRE in name only.</p>



<blockquote><p>“But, You are Not Google”</p><cite>Me talking to many a CIO/VP of Ops</cite></blockquote>



<p>“But, You are not Google”. This is a common refrain I have said to many a CIO or VP of Ops in companies that I have worked on SRE adoption with. I try to be polite, I promise. But really, they are not Google. In the very initial pages of the Google SRE book, in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/production-environment/" target="_blank">introduction</a> itself, the authors describes why Google developed SRE. They have massive data centers on which their services run. These data centers have a high incidence of hardware failure, given their size. This required Google to have the ability to dynamically move services from one part of the data center to another in a fraction of time. Given the large user base of the deployed services, Google also needed to have extremely fast response times to outages and degradation in quality of service, with minimal impact to the user. Their operations teams had to find a way to handle all these incidents, outages and failures in an automated manner to reduce toil and stress on the team. Their incidents, outages and failures were also very repetitive. Given the homogenous nature of the hardware across their datacenters, and the nature of the services deployed, there were very few outliers. Most tasks could (should) be automated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This led to the development of what we today know as SRE. Google had a team of software developers work in operations with the goal of developing software to handle the vast majority of tasks that were assigned to the system administration teams and incident response teams. As the software got more and more mature, more and more typical tasks had been automated. The humans could then focus on the outliers. On tasks that were not ‘typical’. Reliability Engineering meets software engineering = SRE.</p>



<p>If the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph in this section is not an apt description of your datacenters and systems you are running, you do not need SRE. Don’t get me wrong, you need (service/system) Reliability Engineering. You still need to automate repetitive, typical tasks in operations. You just don’t need to, and really should not do it the Google way. You are not Google. Very few organizations are.</p>



<h3><strong>SRE for the Enterprise</strong></h3>



<p>So what does SRE in the ‘regular’ Enterprise look like? It may be easier to describe what it does not look like. Here goes:</p>



<ul><li>You are not replacing your current Ops team, your sys admins with software Engineers. You need your ops team. They know how your custom built infrastructure and systems work. They know its idiosyncrasies. They know when Chicago opens to a ticket to say they are offline again, its the network. Yes, its always the network, but the sysadmins know who to ping at Equinix to get it restored pronto. They know how the option trade desk system slows to a grind on Expiration Friday and you just ignore those tickets from traders that day. And even if you wanted to get rid of all the sys admins, can you afford to hire that many software engineers to replace them all? You can barely fill all your open slots on the dev teams. What you need to do is complement your Ops teams with software engineers who can understand what the teams do day-in, day-out and what tasks are repetitive and typical, and then they can develop tools for automated remediation. These software engineers should be embedded in the ops team, not a separate team on the outside. Think <em>Squads.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE is a no-no.&nbsp;First of all <em>&lt;steps on soapbox/&gt;</em> there should NOT be a team called the DevOps team! You created a new silo to do what was supposed to be a movement to eliminate silos? DevOps should be what everyone does. If you do have a separate team to build automation, that is exactly what they are – the automation building team. And that is exactly what they should do – build automation for others to use. They build tools to enable the processes of DevOps. They do NOT use those tools themselves to do any real deployments. Ever. But I leave my true feelings on this for another blog post <em>&lt;steps off soapbox/&gt;</em>.&nbsp; Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE only gets them to leave for better jobs as real SREs elsewhere at better salaries now that they are formally SREs according to their resumes. Don’t do it. DevOps is DevOps. SRE is SRE. They are joined at the hip, but they are different. SREs have a different set of goals from the application development teams – build automation to reduce toil, increase observability, and improve reliability of the systems in production. They should not be building deployment automation or improving test environments to get better quality signals.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<ul><li>SRE is first and foremost about culture. Do you have a culture that is reliability focussed? What does reliability mean to you? Is it <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/08/18/cloud-service-reliability-part-3-antifragile-when-devops-met-sre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MTBF or MTTR (opens in a new tab)">MTBF or MTTR</a>? Do you have well defined SLAs (or SLOs)? How do you measure them? Do you meet them? Do you have <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2020/01/08/understanding-observability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Observability (opens in a new tab)">Observability</a>? Do you do blameless postmortems of incidents? Are they really blameless? Do you make your developers ‘carry pagers’ and do they do it without fear? Do you deploy on Fridays and sleep well over the weekend?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I am barely scratching the surface of how SRE needs to be adapted for the enterprise (that is not Google). I would like to hear from you. But instead of leaving a comment on this post, which I perfectly OK with, I would prefer you respond to an <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">SRE survey</a> we recently created. I had the opportunity earlier this year to work with three good friends of mine – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA2fPwBkGJsFLhm7pYTiGv1hOwqc3Vxt1I/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Marc Hornbeek</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADGJN4BvhODuicPVGeQAljiRCR_Vx66MQM/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Archana Joshi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJS7zgBfhzivo8mNgusFqmaicqG0wuPYww/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Niladri Choudhury</a> on a <em><a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">State of SRE</a></em> survey commissioned by <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/">Catchpoint</a>. This survey is designed specifically to get a view into how enterprises and other organization not named Google are adopting SRE. If your organization is adopting or thinking of adopting SRE, do take this survey right now. We will be analyzing the results and sharing findings on the current state and trends (this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Catchpoint is running a SRE survey) later this Spring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sweeten the deal, I am offering my time to anyone who completes the survey and wants to talk SRE. Once you complete the survey and want to talk about your SRE adoption or just have questions about SRE, <a href="mailto:sanjeev@sdarchtect.blog">email a screenshot of the completion screen to me</a> and I will schedule a <strong>free 20-minute consult with you and your team</strong>. So, what are you waiting for – click <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">here</a> to go to the survey. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Obstacles to learning from incidents</strong></h2><p>Learning from incidents; it sounds easy, right? We’re always learning...</p><p>Our team or organization has an incident, maybe we responded to it, and then we “learned” from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, just having the incident, even participating in a response team, doesn't mean that the learning that will elevate and improve your organization (at least the way we talk about it on this site) has occurred. Further, even if you have personally learned something, that doesn't mean it’s been disseminated or that others have as well.</p><p>I'm mostly operating from the view that we're talking about <em>your</em> incidents, however you slice that. They typically reside within your organization, though not always your immediate group or team. This isn't exclusive; we will talk briefly about incidents in other organizations as well.</p><h3><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292504703_Distancing_through_differencing_An_obstacle_to_organizational_learning_following_accidents"><strong>Distancing through differencing</strong></a></h3><p>The number one obstacle that can keep an organization from learning from an incident is <em>distancing through differencing</em>. This is when an us vs them sort of mentality emerges to produce all sorts of reasons that though this happened to <em>them</em> it, of course, would <strong>never</strong> happen to <em>us</em>.</p><p>You can be on guard for phrases like:</p><ul role="list"><li>"We would never respond that way"</li><li>"We have our own process to protect us from that"</li><li>"We wouldn't do something [stupid] like that"</li><li>"We're way more careful than they are"</li><li>"Day (or whichever other) shift is always like that, we're not like that"</li></ul><p>Any of the phrases like the above are strong signals that you're seeing <em>distancing through differencing</em> in action. This is something that can happen at multiple levels, when hearing about an incident at another organization or even when hearing about an incident at your organization, but not in your group or team.</p><p>You can begin to counteract this just by knowing and being aware that such a phenomenon exists in our psychology. Of course, all incidents have different specifics, but very often there are patterns that we can recognize in our own environment.</p><p>Further, when examining an incident, we can purposefully look for similarities between that incident and our current context about how the system should work.</p><h3><strong>Overconfidence</strong></h3><p>While having faith in our individual and group ability to face challenges can be a good indicator of an effective team, it is also possible to be overconfident in our ability to respond to or control a system hazard. We can become miscalibrated about the actual risk of an accident or incident to such a degree that we don't think about it or attempt to prepare for it. This of course can lead to surprise if an incident occurs involving that risk.It can be a contributor to a sort of denial that can encourage <em>distancing through differencing</em> as well. I call this out as a specific section though, because treating it can help both further learning and potential future response.</p><p>That doesn't mean that we can't gain confidence in our abilities, but we also don't wish to become out of touch with the reality of risks. High reliability organizational research calls this "<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119175834.ch03">preoccupation with failure</a>," which can help us learn and respond more effectively.</p><p>For example, during my time in EMS I learned to not only trust in my abilities, but also to recognize that accidents would occur that were well beyond them. There was no world where I would be able to treat everything I'd find.</p><h3><strong>Root cause</strong></h3><p>You've likely seen processes where teams engage in a "root cause analysis" or similar, the goal being to find the one thing that started it all so it can be fixed. That way it won't ever happen again. This sounds nice, but unfortunately in complex systems, like the software systems we build and maintain, this doesn't apply. There are multiple things that need to occur in order for the incident to have happened - and they’re important to understand beyond the precipitating event.</p><p><strong>This might just sound like a matter of swapping out words, but it's actually a way of changing approaches.</strong> If we search for just one thing, we're making it almost impossible to find all the other things that contributed that we could possibly learn from. Starting with "root cause" means that we're going into it essentially with the bias of, "I'm going to blind myself to some contributing factors," which will inevitably constrain our learning.</p><p>Further, it can constrain others' learning as well. If it's communicated that there was a root cause to the incident, another person may presume that that is all there is, one fix to be made, problem done and dusted. Nothing to learn from there they may think.</p><p>Of course, our investigations can't continue on eternally, we must constrain our search in some way. But understanding how we choose to constrain our investigations and the naturally occurring constraint in our search for understanding can help us view those results, these lessons from the investigation, in a more effective light.</p><h3><strong>Only trying to learn from "bad" things</strong></h3><p>Often times learning attempts that do take place are strongly focused on the bad things, like what went wrong in a response or a bad outcome. But there is a lot to learn from incidents about what went well, what kept an outcome from being worse, what helped marshal a productive response (see also: <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/blog/oops-learning-from-the-incident-you-didnt-have">OOPS! Learning from the incident you never had</a>).</p><p>Constraining our search for learning to only bad things means we'll miss all the good things. This isn't just a matter of being upbeat or positive, it helps us potentially notice things like:</p><ul role="list"><li>What parts of our incident response plan do we want to practice since it was especially effective?</li><li>What displays or system information helped bring clarity to the chaos?</li><li>What groups or responders were especially prepared to respond to this incident? How did that happen?</li><li>How do we uncover the unwritten know-how held by the daily practitioners making subtle adjustments to keep our systems in a stable state <em>before</em> things go wrong?</li></ul><h3><strong>High pressure reporting requirements</strong></h3><p>This one might seem a bit surprising; after all if incidents aren't reported, they can't be learned from. It's true that if an incident is swept under the rug it can be difficult to learn from, but the other extreme end of the continuum, requiring investigations and reports to be produced in a tightly specified time period can create pressure to "resolve" an investigation quickly.</p><p>This is likely to produce, at best, only a cursory investigation of the incident, making it incredibly difficult to learn from. In my experience, this sort of deadline approach is often a reaction to investigations not being done previously, or a fear that they wouldn't be done otherwise. As a result, a time period is mandated with the hope that that will solve the issue.</p><p>If broader change to this approach isn't yet possible in your organization or group, I've seen some limited success in changing what the deadline represents. That is, requiring an investigation to <em>begin</em> within a certain period (ideally broadly specified as a guideline), but no firm specification on when an investigation has to be done by, as that of course would vary depending on the incident.</p><h3><strong>Making sure this never happens again</strong></h3><p>As we touched on before, every incident is unique if you look at a detailed enough view. It's also possible to get stuck in the details, especially if your goal is to prevent this specific incident, with this exact outcome from ever happening again.</p><p>The detailed view of the individual incident itself should be the <em>starting</em> point to then zoom out and see more and more general things about the system as a whole. If we remain in the very low level detail of an individual incident, we are at risk for creating "fixes" that don't really address the problem and may see a similar looking incident in the future, despite our best efforts.</p><p>Looking at this through the lens of emergency medicine has helped frame this way of thinking. It would be strange to imagine a responder's purpose to ensure a car accident never happens again. Instead, they can advance their skillset and influence systemic factors that can reduce the impact of an entire class of accidents. If they focused all of their efforts on making sure one exact type of car accident didn't happen, one in which someone swerved to miss a deer, on a wet road, while making a turn, etc.they'd likely change a whole bunch of things that may make other accidents more common or impactful while failing to advance the ability to respond to all those other accidents.</p><h3><strong>Confusing writing, distribution, or meetings with learning</strong></h3><p>Often times, in post-incident analysis there will be artifacts produced, possibly some documents. There may even be some meetings during the process. The artifacts may be distributed throughout the company.</p><p>These may be helpful to the process of investigation, the artifacts can even be helpful to review. But none of them inherently cause learning to occur.</p><p>It's important to realize that simply because a meeting was held, a document created, a memo sent, that learning may or may not have occurred. You can make it easier or more effective to learn from these processes or artifacts or create a culture where learning is highly valued, but as an individual or "safety" type group, you <em>cannot</em> cause learning to occur in others.</p><p>When I was in emergency medicine, I learned this firsthand. For one particular ambulance company I would often write reports as a result of my work, but the only people that I knew of that would read them was the "quality" department. If I wrote it in some way they didn't like I'd end up with a meeting often called "chart review" or "report review."</p><p>This process has a lot of the characteristics of what software teams often do in hopes of learning. There would be an incident, I would write a report about it, perhaps a meeting would get scheduled, but it's pretty clear that no substantial learning occurred or was disseminated. That is, unless you count me learning how to write reports to suit a particular audience or learning how much I dislike those meetings.</p><p>If you've used this process …</p></div></div>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

	  <p><span color="#51504E">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My 
		first rule of hitting was to get a good ball to hit. I learned down to 
		percentage points where those good balls were. The box shows my particular 
		preferences, from what I considered my “happy zone” - where I could hit 
		.400 or better - to the low outside corner - where the most I could hope 
		to bat was .230. Only when the situation demands it should a hitter go 
		for the low-percentage pitch.<p>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some players are better high-ball hitters than 
		low-ball hitters, or better outside than in; each batter should work out 
		his own set of percentages. But more important, each should learn the 
		strike zone, because once pitchers find a batter is going to swing at 
		bad pitches he will get nothing else. The strike zone is approximately 
		seven balls wide (allowing for pitches on the corners). When a batter 
		starts swinging at pitches just two inches out of that zone (shaded area), 
		he has increased the pitcher’s target from approximately 4.2 square feet 
		to about 5.8 square feet - an increase of 37 percent. Allow a pitcher 
		that much of an advantage and you will be a .250 hitter.</p></span></p>

<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>
<section>

- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>
<h2 id="other-stripe-resources">Other Stripe Resources</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources we’ve found useful. They run the gamut from the official sources for some of the technologies we’ve mentioned to particularly good community discussions around common issues.</p>

        <h2>About Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
          A matrix of size <span>m × n</span> is a grid of real numbers consisting of <span>m</span> rows and <span>n</span> columns.
          In linear algebra, a branch of mathematics, matrices of size <span>m × n</span> describe linear mappings from <span>n</span>-dimensional to <span>m</span>-dimensional space.
          The word linear roughly means that straight lines map to straight lines and the origin in <span>n</span>‑dimensional space maps to the origin in <span>m</span>‑dimensional space.
          When we have an <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix <span>A</span> and a <span>(n × k)</span>‑matrix <span>B</span>, we can compute the product <span>AB</span> which is an <span>(m × k)</span>‑matrix.
          The mapping corresponding to <span>AB</span> is exactly the composition of the mappings corresponding to <span>A</span> and <span>B</span> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</a> (SVD) states that every <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix <span>A</span> can be written as a product
        </p>
        
        <p>
          where <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> are orthogonal matrices and the the matrix <span>Σ</span> consists of descending non-negative values on its diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
          The entries <span>σ<sub>1</sub> ≥ σ<sub>2</sub> ≥ σ<sub>3</sub> ≥ … ≥ 0</span> on the diagonal of <span>Σ</span> are called the <em>singular values</em> (SVs) of <span>A</span>.
          Geometrically, <span>Σ</span> maps the <span>j</span>‑th unit coordinate vector of <span>n</span>‑dimensional space to the <span>j</span>‑th coordinate vector of <span>m</span>‑dimensional space, scaled by the factor <span>σ<sub>j</sub></span>.
          Orthogonality of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> means that they correspond to rotations (possibly followed by a reflection) of <span>m</span>‑dimensional and <span>n</span>‑dimensional space respectively.
          Therefore only <span>Σ</span> changes the length of vectors.
        </p>
        <h2>Using SVD for image compression</h2>
        <p>
          We can decompose a given image into the three color channels red, green and blue.
          Each channel can be represented as a <span>(m × n)</span>‑matrix with values ranging from 0 to 255.
          We will now compress the matrix <span>A</span> representing one of the channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, we compute an approximation to the matrix <span>A</span> that takes only a fraction of the space to store.
          Now here's the great thing about SVD: the data in the matrices <span>U</span>, <span>Σ</span> and <span>V</span> is sorted by how much it contributes to the matrix <span>A</span> in the product.
          That enables us to get quite a good approximation by simply using only the most important parts of the matrices.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p>
          We now choose a number <span>k</span> of singular values that we are going to use for the approximation.
          The higher this number, the better the quality of the approximation gets but also the more data is needed to encode it.
          We now take only the first <span>k</span> columns of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span> and the upper left <span>(k × k)</span>-square of <span>Σ</span>, containing the <span>k</span> largest (and therefore most important) singular values.
          We then have
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The amount of data needed to store this approximation is proportional to the colored area:
        </p>
        <p>
          compressed size = <span>m × k</span> + <span>k</span> + <span>k × n</span> = k × (<span>1</span> + <span>m</span> + <span>n</span>)
        </p>
        <p>
          (Actually, slightly less space is needed due to the orthogonality of <span>U</span> and <span>V</span>.)
          One can prove that this approximation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation#Basic_low-rank_approximation_problem" title="Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem">optimal in a certain sense</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demo lets you choose the number of singular values <span>k</span> and see how this choice affects the quality of the approximation and the compression rate.
          Notice how for all photographs, the graph showing the singular values looks like a hyperbola: there are only a few really large SVs and a long tail of relatively smaller SVs.
          In contrast, for the random noise image the graph of SVs looks roughly linear.
        </p>
        <p>
          SVD is routinely used in statistics for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal component analysis</a> and in numerical simulations for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction">reducing the order of models</a>.
          For image compression, more sophisticated methods like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_uNPbdenRs">JPG</a> that take human perception into account generally outperform compression using SVD.
        </p>
        <h2>About this demo</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.netlib.org/clapack/">CLAPACK</a> library provides the algorithm for computing the SVD.
          Since CLAPACK is a C library (it is a translation of the Fortran library LAPACK) we use <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">emscripten</a> to translate it to JavaScript/asm.js.
          The SVDs of all three color channels are computed in parallel on the client-side using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker">web workers</a>.
          To provide the quick preview, we use <a href="https://research.facebook.com/blog/294071574113354/fast-randomized-svd/">a randomized algorithm</a> to compute an approximate truncated SVD with 50 singular values.

          The user interface uses <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/akiran/react-slick">react-slick</a> and <a href="http://refreshless.com/nouislider/">noUiSlider</a>.
          Thanks to the creators of all these great projects!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this media release used a hypothetical example that suggested that Google used information about users’ health to personalise or target advertisements. Google says that it does not show personalised ads based on health information. This example has been removed from the media release.</em></p>

<p>The ACCC has launched Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC (Google), alleging Google misled Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers’ internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges Google misled consumers when it failed to properly inform consumers, and did not gain their explicit informed consent, about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers’ Google accounts with information about those individuals’ activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.</p>

<p>This meant this data about users’ non-Google online activity became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Previously, this information had been kept separately from users’ Google accounts, meaning the data was not linked to an individual user.</p>

<p>Google then used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC also alleges that Google misled consumers about a related change to its privacy policy.</p>

<p>“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Google significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers’ express informed consent,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from consumers to take this step.”</p>

<p>“The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits.”</p>

<p>“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the “price” of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>“I agree” notification</strong></p>

<p>The conduct is alleged to have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.</p>

<p>From 28 June 2016 until at least December 2018, Google account holders were prompted to click “I agree” to a pop-up notification from Google that purported to explain how it planned to combine their data, and sought the consumers’ consent for this.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some new features for your Google Account</em></p>

	<p><em>We’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notification also stated,&nbsp;<em>“More information will be available in your Google Account making it easier for you to review and control”</em>; and&nbsp;<em>“Google will use this information to make ads across the web more relevant for you.”</em></p>

<p>Before June 2016, Google only collected and used, for advertising purposes, personally identifiable information about Google account users’ activities on Google owned services and apps like Google Search and YouTube.</p>

<p>After June 2016, when consumers clicked on the “I agree” notification, Google began to collect and store a much wider range of personally identifiable information about the online activities of Google account holders, including their use of third-party sites and apps not owned by Google.</p>

<p>Previously, this additional data had been stored separately from a user’s Google account.</p>

<p>Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that the “I agree” notification was misleading, because consumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used, and so did not - and could not - give informed consent.</p>

<p>“We believe that many consumers, if given an informed choice, may have refused Google permission to combine and use such a wide array of their personal information for Google’s own financial benefit,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy change</strong></p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy that it&nbsp;<em>“will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement:<em>&nbsp;“[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy also states:&nbsp;<em>“[w]e will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.”</em></p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that Google did not in fact obtain consumers’ explicit consent for this change to the privacy policy, and that Google’s statement that it would not reduce consumers’ rights without their explicit consent was therefore misleading.</p>

<p>“Google made a clear representation about how it would protect users’ privacy. The ACCC alleges that Google made changes without obtaining the explicit consent it had promised consumers it would obtain before altering how it protected their private information,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick</strong></p>

<p>In 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Google now supplies DoubleClick’s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, which are the leading suppliers of ad-tech intermediary services.</p>

<p>These services track users’ internet activity on third-party sites that display ads through the use of DoubleClick’s advertising technology.</p>

<p>Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick required approval by competition authorities including the US Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. The ACCC also reviewed and cleared this transaction.</p>

<p>FTC and EC cleared the acquisition, and in doing so considered submissions from Google that it would not be able to combine DoubleClick’s data on consumers’ internet activity with its own data about consumers’ activity on Google services because, at the time, DoubleClick’s contracts with its users prevented Google from doing so.</p>

<p>The agencies did not, however, rely on these submissions in clearing the acquisition.</p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google collected and stored this information on a non-personally identifiable basis, as stated in its privacy policy.</p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, it changed its privacy policy by removing the term explaining how it would treat this DoubleClick data.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the device and Google service being used by the consumer, the notification published by Google from 28 June 2016 was presented in a variety of ways. A copy of the notification in the form published to consumers using desktop devices is provided below for reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I bit the bullet and reformatted my MacBook Pro over the weekend. My motivation for doing this was to start from scratch to figure out what apps I need. I’m documenting the process I followed here. This guide is a work-in-progress.</p>



<h3>Backing Up My Files</h3>



<p>I wanted to keep it simple and work on organizing all of my files later. So I used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to do the hard work with backing up all my files over to my Drobo 5N. This took longer than I expected, so be patient.</p>



<h3>Signing Out</h3>



<p>You’ll need to make sure you sign out and deauthorize applications before you reformat.</p>



<h3>Installing Applications and Configuring</h3>



<p>Since I’m a developer, I’m always on the lookout for MacBook setup guides. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/" target="_blank">this</a> impressive guide by Tania Rascia and was inspired to make my own. </p>



<p>After installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, here are the apps I installed.</p>



<pre><code>brew install \
  git \
  yarn \
  make 

brew cask install 1password bartender brave-browser carbon-copy-cloner cleanmymac cleanshot screenflow visual-studio-code google-chrome firefox iterm2 docker vlc slack keybase postgres postico postman coda malwarebytes steam dotnet-sdk
</code></pre>



<p>Since I needed to install Mac Store apps, I installed and used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" target="_blank">mas-cli</a>.</p>



<pre><code>brew install mas</code></pre>



<pre><code>mas install 937984704 1091189122 775737590 634148309 441258766 1274495053 568494494 485812721 497799835

# Amphetamine
# Bear
# iA Writer  
# Logic Pro X
# Magnet
# Microsoft To Do 
# Pocket
# TweetDeck
# Xcode</code></pre>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cask-versions</a> to install alternative versions of applications that I haven’t upgraded like Alfred.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions</code></pre>



<pre><code>brew cask install alfred3 # then activated my power pack license</code></pre>



<p>Turn off spotlight keyboard shortcut and set keyboard shortcut to <code>CMD + spacebar</code> for Alfred.</p>



<h3>iTerm2 Setup</h3>



<p>I followed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070" target="_blank">this</a> to setup my iTerm2.</p>



<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>



<pre><code>{
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
    "workbench.colorTheme": "New Moon",
    "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",
    "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "terminal.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminal.background": "#002833",
        "terminal.ansiBlack": "#003541",
        "terminal.ansiBlue": "#268bd2",
        "terminal.ansiCyan": "#2aa198",
        "terminal.ansiGreen": "#859901",
        "terminal.ansiMagenta": "#d33682",
        "terminal.ansiRed": "#dc322f",
        "terminal.ansiWhite": "#eee8d5",
        "terminal.ansiYellow": "#b58901",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlack": "#586e75",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlue": "#839496",
        "terminal.ansiBrightCyan": "#93a1a1",
        "terminal.ansiBrightGreen": "#586e75",

        "terminal.ansiBrightRed": "#cb4b16",
        "terminal.ansiBrightWhite": "#fdf6e3",
        "terminal.ansiBrightYellow": "#657b83",
        "terminalCursor.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminalCursor.background": "#003541"
    }
}</code></pre>



<h3>Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects</h3>



<p>I recommend using Stuart Ellis’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/#setting-up-a-directory-structure-for-projects" target="_blank">directory structure</a> for projects, which looks like this for me.</p>



<pre><code>code/
  src/
    github.com/
      westerncj/
        a-project/
    gitlab.com/
      cwestern/
        b-project/</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Over the month, the Netflix’s show “The Last Dance” featuring Michael Jordan’s last year in the bull’s NBA team helped to shine light of his victory and success in his time to the public. Personally as a basketball lover, I’ve always followed him and his amazing story since the beginning of the internet era (I’m serious!). However, getting to 2 years into my software engineering journey helped me see different principles from his life that I could apply into my tech journey. In this post, I’ve decided to share with you all 6 lessons for the 6 championships that MJ has gotten in his career.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>1. Competitive: there is this need for him to win!</h2>

<p>Here’s this short video that simply puts this competitive aspect of him across clearly!</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>As we can see from his life and the especially in the most recent show that came out “The Last Dance”, we could see how he is competitive on almost every aspect of life. From the game of basketball to the game of golf and to tossing coin that is the nearest to the wall.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mike will compete with anything, though. If we’re drinking water, Mike will be like, ‘I’ll race you!’”<br>
Source:&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the lesson I’ve learnt from him to apply into my software engineer journey: Apart from short once-off games such as a casual golf match, or one-on-one basketball matches, many times in technology, the way to show success over another company or implementation is long term. It isn’t a short fight, every technology solution requires time and effort to implement. But the key take away isn’t to compete with companies, more often than not, you can find yourself collaborating such there both parties can win. I guess the key takeaway is that sense of self confidence. When you first start off your blogging venture like I did, you look into the industry and you start seeing all the successful blogs with million views and high passive income. And you wonder how can you even compare? The message we can take away from Michael Jordan is that attitude that never backs down. You may be the under-dog today but you do not have to stay this way, and you can deliberately choose to be better than what you are now.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Passion was his fuel. Pour your love into everything you do.</h2>
<br>

￼</p></div>
<p>Here’s a short video that managed to capture the emotions that was building in that locker room after the victory that night.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir0-t5Yfq-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>There’s just so much emotions, energy, and heart placed into this game. From the story of him being cut from his high school basketball team that hurt him over the summer. He decided to pour his heart and do his absolute best to get back onto the team. It has been 7 years since he entered NBA and to finally be able to reach to the top through the many years. Even as Michael cried holding that trophy, there was just so much passion and emotions put into whatever he did.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>”I’ve been waiting seven years for this and I thank God for blessing us to make it possible,”</p>
<p>”This is the happiest moment of my life,” Jordan said. “We did it. We did it as a team. I’ve been fighting to hold back my emotions all week. But I knew we would win it tonight and I knew my emotions would get the best of me. I’m just happy.”<br>
Jordan said.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Heart is what separates the great from the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, I do see parallel behaviors among the giants even in the technology scene as well. We can see that from the life of Steve Jobs. Here’s an article that briefly talked about his stroy.</p>
<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/11/why-steve-jobs-cried/">Why Steve Jobs cried</a></p>

<p>The main point isn’t to cry over every thing that happened but to talk about that deep sense of passion and heart in what you do. I guess such a level of passion in any tasks or goal speaks more of the dedication that person has as an individual than about the seriousness of the task.</p>

<p>If you want to excel into any industry, you got to have that passion that pushes you beyond the boundaries to explore what could be beyond this limit. This is all the more true in the technology industry where all these technologies advancing with new updates or releases. In order to keep up, you got to have that sense of curiosity to find out what the industry has done to solve all the different problems you have. Only when you have that sense of curiosity then can you want to go out there to find out what are these technology giants doing. Let me give you an illustration:</p>

<p>Here’s a <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">Roadmap for devops engineer</a>. It basically charts out for you the set of learnings or knowledge you should know or master if you ever chooses to walk down this path of being a devOps engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Just look at the amount of technology in one single page</strong>. And each box properly takes an individual years to master, and some even pursue just one box their entire career. If you did not have any interest or deep passion for the tools out there, you will probably just ignore most of that because you could just make do with the tools you already know to ‘hack’ your way to a solution.</p>

<p>The successful techies are not always the oldest, but more often than not, you find in these people a deep sense of curiosity and passion for the technology. The way they describe technology almost always sound like they are describing a friend you have to got to know on a daily basis. And one day, I aspire to be like one of them as well (:</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Focused on what he wants to do. And actually go get it</h2>

<p>One common trait among all great players or individuals that we know of, Warran buffet, Steve jobs, and Michael Jordan: They had laser sharp focus on what they want to do.</p>

<p>The focus to improve is not found on the court. What you see on the court in public’s view was merely the outcome of the grind behind closed doors in the gym. The focus to improve starts in the gym behind closed doors and far from media. He made sure to practice harder than that he played. That intensity of personal practice allowed him to create that familiarity and comfort zone during game time, and all he had to do was the react to what his body was already accustomed to do. He focused on getting his fundamentals right. Focused to perfect the small things that noone seem to notice. People only saw the outcome of that focus to little details.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing the little things until perfection becomes a habit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zSVu76AX3I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Many times people chase after the shiniest objects in the technology space - AI, Automation, Machine Learning. In the act of chasing, people lose sight of the fundamentals - understanding the business problem or creating product and services that business actually need or even simply just focusing on writing clean, testable, and readable code. While articles about AI and Machine learning may create some wows, it is the seemingly dull and ‘boring’ habits of consistently writing code, learning about good coding practices that sharpens your fundamentals. When it is crunch time, you will find yourself well equipped to shine in your work. These little act of grinding can be attending online courses to learn more about courses that does hands-on projects with you.</p>

<p>One such course is <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pluralsight.com/">Plural sight</a>. They have really detailed courses with instructors that will guide you through the fundamentals of what you are learning, impart the best practices and share their learning in a walkthrough guide that you can do alongside them. Another will be udemy. Check those out.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>When you practice daily and deliberately, you will find yourself ready when the next challenge or problem comes your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>4. Together we can do more: he has a close group of people to keep him grounded</h2>

<p>People do not usually see this aspect of him when we hear of the great Michael Jordan. Many instances, I’ve noticed from all the videos, he always had the support of his parents and siblings when he hits rock bottom. Even during the first championship, his dad was present there alongside him. And was also there to deal with backlashes about MJ’s gambling habits.</p>

<p>Imagine the devastation to know that your strong support was taken away just like that.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GG5xXWHyq9g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you want to go far, you have to go together as a team. Over the years, I’ve came to understand that if we want to solve problems that are bigger than ourselves - societal issues, you have to have a team alongside you. You have your strength to offer to the table, but rarely do we see how our strengths alone is able to bring a holistic solution. Yes, you may be an amazing god-like engineer that can replicate another google. Even with all the knowledge in the world, you lack the one resource you cannot buy - time. Everyone of us needs one another. In technology, the ability to come together with our different skills and collaborate opens up door of opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Know how to respond to failure: failure is the only way to success</h2>

<p>Michael Jordan did not fear the spot light. He did not shy away from the crunch time. When it was time for the bulls team to take the final score, it goes to him without a question. But that illusion of ‘success since birth’ did not start that way. He was not always a winner. There is this famous quote from him:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JA7G7AV-LT8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>It is always easy to make sense of all these failures on hindsight - this is called the hindsight bias, where the decisions and circumstances you faced seems like an invisible ink before the good outcome, but plain as day after the outcome as if a fool would have missed it.</p>

<p>Similarly in technology, as you start off, you will find yourself deep into the unknown; overwhelmed with unfamiliarity regarding the technology you have to deal with in order to deliver the solution. You make mistakes in your earlier days and thus causing scalability issues when the solution starts to scale to hundreds of people. Since that feature is implemented by you, these mistakes and bugs are starting to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-8a4d83837a563922fa44"><p>One of the most challenging aspects of starting and maintaining a business, regardless of whether you are a freelancer or a conglomerate, is determining the right price to charge for your services.&nbsp; If you are an economist, the ideal price is simply the point at which demand meets supply.  If a price is too high the demand for the service will go down thereby resulting in excess supply or capacity by the service provider.  If the  price is too low then demand will increasing leaving the supplier less availability to meet demand.  Of course, pricing can be significantly more complex than this and has become a lot more sophisticated in recent years.   Businesses pay thousands of dollars to pricing consultants for strategies that take numerous factors into consideration when determining pricing.  One only has to look to airlines as example of a seemingly inscrutable pricing model.  Unfortunately, smaller businesses, freelancers and startups don’t usually have the budget for a pricing strategist and have to make do by searching for information available on the internet, discussing it with their business associates  or simply using their gut to come up with something that makes sense.  As an internet source, I have set out a strategy for determining a price for your services </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1439256306507_6993"><div><h3><strong>Calculate Baseline Pricing for Your Services</strong></h3><p>A good starting point is to determine how much you could earn if you were employed either full time or part time, and translate this to an hourly rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is a calculator to help you determine your hourly rate based on a full time salary:</p><p><strong>Annual Salary</strong> estimate for an employee doing the same job </p><p><strong>Annual Tax Benefits Paid By Employer</strong> including <a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/understanding-payroll-deductions-personal-income-tax-rates-c.html">Payroll taxes such as CPP, QPIP, QHSF</a> as well as group insurance, automobile allowance,<a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/guidelines-for-deducting-conference-and-training-expenses"> professional development</a> etc.  This is usually calculated as 10-15% of your salary.</p><p><strong>Annual Estimated </strong><a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/20-essential-tax-facts-for-small-business-owners.html"><strong>Expenses</strong> of running the business</a> could include rent, supplies, direct expenses of supplying the service, subcontractors, subscriptions, office supplies etc.</p><p><strong>Number of WEEKLY TOTAL hours </strong>that you plan to work in your business .  This is usually 35-40 hours if you plan to work full time but can also be less if you only plan to work part time.</p><p><strong>Number of WEEKLY Hours Spent on Administration&nbsp;</strong> represents a variety of <a href="https://www.montrealfinancial.ca/blog/the-many-hats-of-self-employment.html">administrative tasks such as marketing, accounting, sales, IT, updating your website </a>etc. that can take up a significant amount of time but for which you can’t specifically charge your clients.  Instead this is built into your hourly rate. </p><p><strong>Number of Weeks&nbsp;<em>Per Year</em></strong>&nbsp;Working on Business can be anywhere up to 52 weeks.  If you want to take 4 weeks of vacation per year, this number would be 48 weeks.</p><h3><strong>HOURLY RATE CALCULATOR FOR BUSINESS SERVICES:</strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594594020315_43906"><div><p>Using the calculator above, if you were to work 40 hours a week, you would need to charge $37.50 an hour to earn an amount that is approximately equivalent to $50,000 a year. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Compare the Baseline Hourly Rate to Competitors and other sources</strong></h3><p>In order to identify the competition, you should search for similar business with comparable service offerings and determine pricing for their services.  You will likely find a wide range of pricing which is influenced by where you are located, how much experience you have, the breadth of services that you are able to offer including complementary services (eg. offering web development along with web hosting).  Once you have an idea of what the fees are for their services, you can see how your own baseline compares.  </p><p>It can also be useful to speak to colleagues, other business owners and post on business related message boards/sub-reddits etc. to try and glean what a reasonable rate is for the services that you are providing.  Other sources include UpWork, Fiverr and other freelance websites where people often post their services that will provide more of a range.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594594020588_38801"><div><h3><strong>Determine how you are going to differentiate your services from your competitors</strong></h3><p>Since almost every existing service is already being provided by someone else and your competition is no longer only businesses in your area, but anyone who is willing to work remotely, it is essential that you think about what differentiates you and your service offerings from the other businesses in your space.&nbsp; There are numerous ways of differentiating yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Offer a complimentary service to every client that signs up with you, </p></li><li><p>Personalize the services to meet your clients needs.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Have a unique pricing structure that is based on results (see discussion on pricing below)</p></li><li><p>Create a loyalty program</p></li><li><p>Offer a money back guarantee if they are not satisfied</p></li><li><p>Write articles that highlight your expertise or create an app that is useful to your target market</p></li></ul><p>Once you have honed in on what differentiates your service offerings, you need to be able to communicate this effectively to your potential clients.  This will allow them to see the value in your services.  Although, many businesses particularly, when they are first starting out, feel that they have to compete on price, this could not be further from the truth.  Often potential customers will shy away from the lowest cost option as this might suggest lower quality.  Also, they are looking to solve a problem and many business owners know from experience that going with the cheapest provider who ultimately can’t provide them with the service they need, can end up being more costly in the long run.</p><h3><strong>come up with a pricing strategy for your services</strong></h3><p>There are essentially two ways you can price your services:</p><p><strong>Hourly Based Pricing</strong></p><p>Perhaps  the most popular method by which business price their services is on an hourly basis.  The benefit of hourly pricing is that it is simple to implement and to track.  Clients will often expect to pay an hourly rate and therefore it is an easier sell.  The downside of pricing on an hourly basis is that clients  are often (unpleasantly) surprised by the amount of time a job may take which requires justification and often requires that you reduce your price just to keep them happy.  The other significant downside is that, to paraphrase <a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Ronald Baker</a> , you have created a ceiling on how much you can charge.  This means that since you only have a limited amount of time, there is a maximum amount that you can earn which is the number of hours worked times X your hourly rate.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Value Based Pricing</a></p><p>Simply speaking, value based pricing is the price that you would charge to a customer based on the value that they perceive.  A great example of this would be a painting by Van Gogh.  If you were to take the cost of materials and labour (his hourly rate would have been very low in his lifetime), the painting would sell for a few hundred dollars. Using the value pricing model, his painting “<em>The Portrait of Doctor Gachet” </em>sold for more than $80 million, which was the value of the painting to the purchaser.  Sadly, most of us cannot charge $80 million for our services.  However, it does underline the point that customers might be willing to pay more for our services as long as we can demonstrate their value to them.  </p><p>Demonstrating value can be done in a variety of ways.  One example would be to show a customer how your web development service where you implement an online shopping app will directly increase their revenues.  A pricing structure can be created whereby you charge the customer for the percentage of increase in revenues or it can be a hybrid of a fixed price for the project + a percentage of sales.  Another example would be to communicate to them on how your accounting service will help them to reduce their interest and penalties by ensuring that tax returns are filed or debt payments are made on a timely basis. A third example would be a collection service that promises to improve the collection of customer receivables by 25% thereby increasing the customer’s cash flow.  </p><p>All of these are examples of services that could be highly valuable to a client.  The goal for the business service provider is to put a value on how much these services are worth and charge that price.  The benefits of the value pricing model is that the customer knows exactly how much they are going to pay up front so there are no surprises and the price of the service can be quite a bit higher than simply charging the hourly rate than the number of hours.  The downside is that you have to effectively communicate to your client the value of your service.  Also,  there might be unforeseen issues or it might end up taking much longer than you anticipated.  </p><p>Using value based pricing requires that you essentially provide a pre-determined price, that you and your client agree on, for a project or ongoing service.  An excellent resource on the subject can be in found in <a href="https://amzn.to/3fpatAq">Ronald Baker’s book on value pricing</a>.  Once you have calculated how much you are going to charge, you can bill your client once certain milestones have been reached, all at once or for ongoing services on a monthly basis.  It can also be very useful to provide a client with different options (usually 3 options) to choose from which increases the likelihood that they will choose one of the options.  (This is a variation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> where simple probability suggests that there is a only a 50% chance of choose one of two options but a 75% chance of choosing one of 4 options)</p><p>Although overvaluing your services can be bad for business, undervaluing them can be equally damaging. Clients are often more willing to stick with a business that provides great service, is passionate , possesses superior knowledge and continues to provide value on an ongoing basis rather than one that only offers a lower price.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Dependency Inject (DI) is one of the most notable practices to create reliable and high-quality software. This effort enables us to keep the extensibility without losing readability and testability. You may have encountered a situation where you would want to replace any objects in the software flexibly like me. Many frameworks or libraries are allowing us to make use of the dependency injection in our software project. In my case, I would like to use <a href="https://dagger.dev/">Dagger</a> in our web application using <a href="https://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a>. But I was ignorant of what Dagger was and how to use it in our Dropwizard project. Hence, this article is for writing down the process to get started with Dagger in your web application using Dropwizard.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dagger">What is Dagger</h2>

<p>First of all, what is Dagger? Dagger is a Java-based dependency injection library originally invented by <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. For now, it’s mainly maintained by Google as an open-source project.</p>

<p>You might hear about <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a> before, which is also maintained by Google. It has a more extended history than Dagger. Despite that, Dagger has a more significant number of stars in <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">its GitHub repository</a>. Why is Dagger more popular than Guice? There are several reasons from my perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dagger is compiling time DI library, while Guice’s injection happens at runtime</li>
  <li>Guice often causes challenging error to solve relating to its reflection usage</li>
  <li>Dagger provides more simple APIs to use</li>
  <li>Dagger has notable use cases due to the adoption in the Android development</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I try to use Dagger in our web application this time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-integrate-dagger-in-dropwizard-project">How to integrate Dagger in Dropwizard project</h2>

<p>What I’m going to do is integrate Dagger in a Dropwizard project to inject Jersey resources flexibly. Before going deeper into this goal, we need to be familiar with some Dagger terminologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Module</code>: Has associations between the interface and actual injected objects.</li>
  <li><code>Component</code>: Constructs a whole graph resolving the dependencies of injected objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Guice, what I’ve found is that we needed to construct one more class called <code>Component</code>. The component is a sort of highest level class managing all objects injected by Dagger. Therefore, all objects should be injected from the component.</p>

<p>In our case, we will create <code>WebResourceModule</code> for the module and <code>WebappComponent</code> for the component.</p>

<p>The client of the injected class can use the <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> annotation. Constructor injection or field injection is recommended in Dagger.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/users"</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>UserResource</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>@Inject</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>UserResource</span><span>(</span><span>UserConfig</span> <span>userConfig</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Used for the user resource specific configuration</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are going to inject <code>UserConfig</code> as we like by using Dagger.</p>

<p>The dagger library can be imported with the following code in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>implementation</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.28.1'</span>
  <span>annotationProcessor</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.28.1'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="module-and-component">Module and Component</h2>

<p>First, we define the module to illustrate how to construct the target <code>UserConfig</code> class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Module</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dagger.Provides</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Module</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>UserConfig</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>configuration</span><span>.</span><span>getUserConfig</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@Provides</span>
    <span>UserConfig</span> <span>provideUserConfig</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>@Provides</code> annotation lets the compiler know how to construct the class at the compile time. Therefore, all classes in the application use the <code>UserConfig</code> constructed by the method, <code>provideUserConfig</code>. Next, we can create a module class for building the whole dependency graph.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Component</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Component</span><span>(</span><span>modules</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>WebResourceModule</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>})</span>
<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>UserResource</span> <span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The argument of <code>@Component</code> annotation specifies the modules knowing how to construct the injected objects. All <code>WebappComponent</code> interface needs to provide is the method to build the object we finally want to get. In this case, the web resource which will be registered into the Dropwizard later. That’s all that we must do with Dagger.</p>

<p>But here comes one question. Who creates the instance of <code>WebappComponent</code>? The answer is Dagger. Dagger generates a class prefixed by <code>Dagger</code>. In this case, <code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> will be created to construct the <code>UserResource</code> from it. Additionally, it provides us a way to bind a module at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="dropwizard-application">Dropwizard Application</h2>

<p>In the Dropwizard, we will get the component class to get the <code>UserResource</code> and register it as a jersey resource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Application</span> <span>extends</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>dropwizard</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Configuration</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Application</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Override</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>@NotNull</span> <span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>,</span> <span>Environment</span> <span>environment</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Bind the module to inject the user configuration</span>
    <span>// All objects dependent on the UserConfig can change the behavior without rewriting them.</span>
    <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>component</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                                <span>new</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

    <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>jersey</span><span>().</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>component</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> has a builder interface to bind the module at runtime. By changing the module here, we can change the behavior. For the test purpose, we can write a component like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WebappComponent</span> <span>testComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                            <span>new</span> <span>TestWebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

<span>UserResource</span> <span>testUserResource</span> <span>=</span> <span>testComponent</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It obviously helps us write more testable code.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>

<p>As we saw now, using a Dagger looks easy. Dagger enabled me to write more maintainable code without learning many things. Its simple APIs significantly reduce the trouble and burden to employ the DI framework in our software projects. Let’s try to use Dagger in your Dropwizard project as well!</p>

He says, “All BS. I wasn’t meant for educators, as those are actually their issues with me (i.e. teaching disabilities).”</p><p>He’s an inspiration as I’ve faced similar obstacles especially with the focus of compliance in the educational system over creativity, curiosity, even intellect has <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">hurt me in my educational career</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p>I started writing these <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">essays</a> and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU87CN_FxGC1q3hzWM0CCDA" target="_blank">videos</a> because <strong>ideas are the currency of the 21st century. </strong>I humbly believe the ideas I share could help others as I pursue my <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.substack.com/" target="_blank">Curiosities</a><em>.</em></p><p>Eric Weinstein’s ideas have awakened me and showed a world unknown to most people, such as the real world of academia and science.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these ideas is what he calls the <strong>DISC</strong> (Distributed Idea Suppression Complex) which explains how disruptive and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are suppressed. Keeping institutions safe from individuals who create change.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is spread throughout major institutions such as in academia, the mainstream media, and politics. It tries to undermine ideas that may challenge or weaken the elite. This isn’t directly planned, and it’s not under central control.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric and his family have been victims of the DISC multiple times. Eric in physics, his wife in economics, and his brother in biology. He started noticing the same pattern in politics when MSNBC hid polling graphics of presidential candidate Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is only one of these marvelous ideas that Eric explores in his podcast called The Portal where he explores subjects including science, economics, culture, politics, and business.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the show is to help you see the world through a different lens, which opens up your mind to new ways of viewing events and your life. Each guest is a portal to a reality showcasing what we would normally consider impossible, are indeed possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s visit The Portal!</p><h2>Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Eric launched The Portal in June 2019 and less than a year later has created a community of people who want to explore this hidden reality and discover new portals.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric has wide expertise in many fields, but what’s interesting is how he engages your mind, moves your heart, and lights a spark in your soul. Eric can discover unexplored worlds and bring them back to his audience. Sometimes, complex or hard to understand, but always interesting where you get the sense of upgrading your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my favorite episodes:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s" target="_blank"><strong>1: Peter Thiel:</strong></a><strong> </strong>this was how I found the podcast. Peter rarely appears on interviews, so I knew this one had to be special. Peter Thiel is one of the most influential and contrarian thinkers of the last decades. He’s also the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir. He was also the first big investor in Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Eric challenge our way of thinking and encourage us to see things differently. For instance, they discussed the relationship between growth and violence. Thiel argues that if economic growth is low, violence is more likely to arise. He highlights that violence among humans is high because according to Rene Girard, we want what other people want, giving rise to conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>This may be one of the best episodes in the history of podcasts. I found this conversion can help you understand Girard’s theories' implications in society, especially in a time of wealth gap inequality, racial conflicts, and a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>They also discussed the era of stagnation, the future of education, student debt, the broken world of academia, and polymaths.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter (a conservative) and Eric (a progressive) discuss ideas with unique and often opposing views as they try to find a solution and reach an agreement on his arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000462975502" target="_blank"><strong>19: Bret Weinstein - The Prediction and the DISC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In this rigid conversation with Bret, they talked about the DISC and how it affected Bret with one of his biology discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Eric eagerly tries to get his brother to tell the story of his powerful finding. Bret discovered that the mice we use for medical trials have ultra-long telomeres (something humans don’t have) and that these “hide” the dangers of certain medicines. This same discovery could cure cancer and end aging.&nbsp;</p><p>After he discovered this, he tried to go the usual path of peer-review and so on. According to the podcast, he was silenced. Yet his findings were taken and made someone else the Nobel Prize winner.&nbsp;</p><p>A mind-blowing episode that will stir your curiosity and make you learn about the findings, the DISC, and The Portal.</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000460365533" target="_blank"><strong>17: Anna Khachiyan - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine From The Ashes Of “The Feminine Mystique”:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Eric interviews Anna, who is a Russian-American social, literary and artistic theorist. She is also the co-host of the fierce and popular Red Scare podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the conversation, Eric tells her, “I've been addicted to your podcast not quite understanding why. It's one of the strangest things I've ever found.” That’s exactly how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about mystery and how society thought we wanted clarity and directness. But what we actually want is mystery, especially in our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they talked about the importance of mystery and what it means to be mysterious. This episode will help you perceive the significance of how we can use mystery in our lives.</p><p>I’ll be honest, I don’t know why I liked this episode, but I listened to it several times and it was weirdly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS </strong><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000477637846" target="_blank"><strong>36: Dark Matter, Black Matters and All That Jazz</strong></a><strong> </strong>with Stephon Alexander is an amazing episode to learn more about physics, racial issues, and music.&nbsp;</p><h2>Geometrically Unified</h2><p>I disagree with many of Eric’s views, however I still consider him a role model because of his love and passion for science. He proposed a theory of everything called Geometric Unity where he tried to explain and combine all physical aspects of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>I love learning about science. I read books, email experts, watch interviews, write essays, and listen to podcasts like The Portal to learn more about science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Science</strong> combined with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> has the power to create a world of progress and technological advancement, so we create a world of equality, fairness, and peace.&nbsp; That’s what I hope to do with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you find Eric’s work as interesting, fascinating, and curious as I have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank">Jen</a>, <a href="https://salman.io/" target="_blank">Salman</a>, <a href="https://juliasaxena.com/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://fullofkrapp.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>  for reading drafts of this essay. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595770382135_5451"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>newsletter</strong></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. <br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>I manage this website with markdown and a shell scripts. Hereâ€™s how.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast load time</li>
<li>Minimal Interface</li>
<li>A site directory</li>
<li>Readable URLs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>A fancy framework</li>
<li>Site analytics/admin interface</li>
<li>Large files</li>
<li>Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent some time in HTML/CSS designing a header for the site. This includes a generic title for each page, an â€œAboutâ€� tab, â€œPostsâ€� tab, â€œContactâ€� tab, and horizontal bar to separate the header from the body. I linked each tab to the URL I planned for each page, which is my domain (jarbus.net) followed by the filename with the <code>.html</code> extension removed. (e.g.Â&nbsp;jarbus.net/About)</p>
<p>I write all my posts in markdown, then convert it to HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a conversion script to turn an HTML file for a post into an HTML file for the site. I accomplish this by creating a new file consisting of the header HTML mentioned, concatenating with the post HTML afterwards. I also run a <code>sed</code> command to replace the generic title in the header for the filename of the post, with dashes replaced with spaces.</p>
<p>I keep my markdown files in a directory called â€œdraftsâ€�, which is sibling to the GitHub Pages repository thatâ€™s hosting my website. When Iâ€™m done with a post, I convert it to a site page, move it to the git repository, then push. Itâ€™s that easy!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/About">About</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/jarbus.net">Index</a>, and <a href="http://jarbus.net/Contact">Contact</a> pages all maintained as above. I used to have a script to automatically recreate my <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a> page to add new entries, but found that I much prefer the curated &amp; categorical page I have now.</p>

<p>I also have an <a href="http://jarbus.net/feed">rss feed</a>, which I update manually. However, given that adding a new entry simply requires putting</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
    PostName
  &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    https://www.jarbus.net/PostName
  &lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<p>at the top of my feed file, I think Iâ€™ll manage. Plus, I enjoy the ability add custom tags on a post by post basis if I decide to.</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with how the site turned outâ€“I have absolute control over all aspects of my blog while doing negligible content management. I have lighting-fast load times, a minimal interface, and can fix any aspect of my site were something to break.</p>

    <div>
        <p>As much as I like the Amazon Firestick and Apple TV, both are missing a killer smart TV feature: the ability to easily make memes from viewed content.</p>

<p>Currently, if you want to make a meme from video content, you need to either screenshot the appropriate frames or capture a section of the video. This can be done somewhat easily on mobile and increasingly so on desktop, but it’s still a chore.</p>

<p>But if you are sitting on the couch and you see something funny on your Smart TV, the process of creating a meme is much higher friction. How likely is it that you will pull out another device, find the same content all-over again, capture it, then edit into a meme? I’m exhausted just at the thought.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-solution-meme-it">Proposed Solution: “Meme It!”</h2>

<p>Instead, what if the next time you are watching TV and you see a funny and loop-able moment like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Loop.png" alt="Lucille Bluth's exaggerated wink on Arrested Development"></p>

<p>Or you see a funny clip of a show like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Panels.png" alt="Scene from Parks and Rec"></p>

<p>You, as the user, can just speak into your smart TV remote and say “Meme It!”</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Capture.png" alt="User says &quot;Meme It!&quot; into smart TV remote"></p>

<p>Later at your convenience, you can edit the desired video into a meme using the smart TV app on your phone. By default, the previous 10 seconds of audio, video, and closed captioning text. But if you want to capture more time just say “Meme It last X seconds.”</p>

<p>And unlike creating memes on mobile or desktop, the “Meme It” server knows that the user is capturing media for the purpose of meme creation as opposed to capturing video or business purposes. As a result, the server can then process the video and create markers with thumbnails for each cut from one camera view to another or moments when the total count of people / entities in-frame changes.</p>

<h2 id="usages-and-applications">Usages and Applications</h2>

<p>Publishing the resulting memes to social networks is table-stakes but a few more interesting applications include:</p>



<p>As OTT networks continue to compete for increasingly limited disposal personal income, any strategy that increases stickiness at a lower cost than exclusive content can and should be tried in my opinion. And while I do not think an OTT social network will ever replace the dominant social networks, users could still find value in them if they are integrated into the media consumption. What that would look like would vary by platform: any Disney social features will need to be closely moderated for family friendliness while Adult Swim’s would be a much wilder and woolier place.</p>

<h3 id="meme-based-content-discovery">Meme-Based Content Discovery</h3>

<p>Further, I wouldn’t mind browsing TV content via Memes. It is frustrating to wait and see if one likes a new TV show - maybe it gets funnier in the next episode, or maybe it doesn’t - but seeing a few of the shows greatest moments in meme format could help.</p>

<p><img src="http://jelling.io/assets/img/memeit/Show%20Page.png" alt="Parks and Rec show page with memes"></p>

<h3 id="personal-meme-wallet">Personal Meme Wallet</h3>

<p>Most memes are currently created for distribution in the relatively “big rooms” of social networks. As high friction as it is to create video memes right now, that makes sense in terms of the effort:reward ratio.</p>

<p>But as “Meme It!” drastically reduce the required work, people will create more memes, and I expect, increasingly for smaller audiences, such as families or partners. That 3 second video loop may not be funny to everyone but it might slay in your small group, especially if it was initially viewed together. To facilitate this, any memes created via “Meme It” in a “Meme Wallet” that can be accessed via iMessenger / Hangouts / Whats App / any messaging application.</p>

<p>Content Publishers may not like the idea of more people repurposing their content but I think this is counter-productive. Just like it is largely true that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, having content memed is free advertisement for the original piece of content.</p>

<p>I would go as far as to say that shows that are not memed will have much shorter lifespans than those that are. No-one who is currently 12 years old will be unaware that the TV show “The Office” exists due to the plethora of memes from the show. But “Seinfeld” is far less memed and I suspect it will fade quicker as a result.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The “Meme It!” Smart TV voice command would let smart TV users easily create memes from recently watched content. Reducing the friction of creating memes would lead to more fun memes and frankly we could all use a little more of that right now. And meme-ing video content is effectively free advertising so hopefully copyright rights holders will give this their blessing.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This essay is an illustrated proof of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem; the NFL theorem has many variants, which all say slightly different things. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">most famous one</a> says, roughly, that every learning algorithm has the same performance, when averaged across all possible target functions. In other words, there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms every other algorithm on every learning task.</p>

<p>Throughout this essay, I'm going to be refering to a "learning algorithm". If you're unfamiliar, in the machine learning context, a learning algorithm is an algorithm that takes in \(S\), a series of (x,y) pairs, i.e. our training data or training set, from some target function and outputs a hypothesis, which is a function that tries to be close to the original target function. Note that the inputs and outputs aren't necessarily  binary, but it's easier to illustrate them as such, and the proof is not affected. Learning algorithms are often evaluated by looking at the error rate, which in the case of classification, is the proportion of \((x,y)\) pairs it predicts incorrectly.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/hypothesis.svg"></p>

<p>In this essay, I will focus on an easier NFL theorem (from <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/%7Eshais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David</a>) which says, roughly, for any learning algorithm that outputs a binary function, there exists a distribution that will cause it to output a hypothesis with a high error rate, even when there exists another function that can achieve 0 error on the distribution. In other words, for every learning algorithm, we can find a distribution that can trip up the learning algorithm.</p>

<p>How do we formalize this? </p>

<p>The NFL theorem we're going to prove states that:</p>

<p>Say we have a learning algorithm A which outputs a binary classifier (this is our hypothesis) over a domain \(X\). </p>

<p>Next, let's define an error or loss function, which will tell us how well our output hypothesis does on the actual distribution. We'll use the <strong>1</strong> loss function \(L\) which, when given two inputs, outputs 0 if the two values match, otherwise it outputs 1. Then, there exists a distribution \(D\) over \(X \times \{0,1\}\) (i.e. a distribution over possible \((x,\{0,1\})\) values) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There exists a function \(f: X \to \{0,1\}\) with \(L_D(f) = 0\). That is, there is some binary function over \(X\) such that the expected loss of \(f\) over \(D\) is 0. In other words, there is some function which will correctly classify all the points in our distribution correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>With probability of at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) over the choice of \(S \sim D^m\) \(L_D(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}\). In other words, for at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) of all possible training sets of size \(m\) from \(D\), the expected loss of output of the training algorithm on the training set is at least  \(\frac{1}{8}\). (Note that our loss function is defined here as the average <strong>1</strong> loss across all points in the distribution).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution \(D\) is defined over \(2m\) points, so our training set will consist of at most \(m\) unique values, i.e. half of the distribution's points. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/nfl-base.svg"></p>

<p>To prove this, we are actually going to prove something different, but equivalent. Instead, we are going to prove that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))] \ge 1/4\)</p>

<p>That is, if we run our learning algorithm on training sets of size \(m\), across a family of distributions \(D_1-D_T\), the largest such expected loss will be at least \(\frac{1}{4}\). In other words, we will show that at least one distribution \(D_i\) from this group will trip up our algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/dist-one-fourth-error.svg"></p>

<p>To see how these two statements are equivalent, we just apply a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markvov's inequality</a>. This lower bounds how likely a random variable is to be greater than some value:</p>

<p>\(P(X \ge a) \ge \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]-a}{1-a}\)</p>

<p>Applying that to our inequality above, we see that:</p>

<p>\(P(L_{D_i}(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}) \ge \frac{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}} \ge \frac{1}{7}\) as desired. So now we just need prove this new inequality.</p>

<p>Before that, here's the intuition for why this inequality is true:</p>

<p>First, our learning algorithm only gets half of all possible points as its training set. This means our algorithm knows nothing about the labels of the other half of the points. Now, if we assume that every function over these unknown points is equally likely, then each point is either 1 or a 0. This means that our algorithm can only guess for these unknown points, which makes its expected error rate 0.5. So in the best case, it'll still get an error rate of 0 on the half it sees and 0.5 on the half it doesn't see, which makes its overall error 0.25.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/seen-unseen-data.svg"></p>

<h3>The Proof</h3>

<p>Now, let's begin the proof.</p>

<p>Let \(C \subseteq X\) such that \(|C| = 2m\). So it's a subset of our input space that's of size \(2m\). </p>

<p>Notice that there are \(T = 2^{2m}\) possible functions from \(C\) to \(\{0,1\}\).  Let \(D_i\) be the distribution over \(D\) that only assigns probability to the \((x,f_i(x))\) pairs for the corresponding function. This captures the idea that our input space \(C\) is twice the size of our training set, and that each function is equally likely. </p>

<p>Each function is now turned into a probability distribution that places \(\frac{1}{|C|}\) probability if the given \((x,y)\) point is one of the function's input/output pairs, and 0 probability otherwise. So each unique function has a unique distribution associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/function-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Recall that we're trying to calculate \(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\), i.e. the expected loss over all possible training examples, with regards to the distribution that maximizes this loss. </p>

<p>For any given distribution,  \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\) is the loss for a given training set, averaged over all possible choices of training data. </p>

<p>If our input space consists of \(2m\) points and our training data consists of a sequence of \(m\) points, then there are \(k = (2m)^m\) possible sequences. </p>

<p>Below, we'll let \(S_j^i\) be the \(i^{th}\) possible sequence of training data, labeled with the \(j^{th}\) possible function. </p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sij.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus, we know that \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}}[L_{D_i}(A(S))] = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\). In other words, for any one given distribution of data, the expected loss of our learning algorithm (across all training data sets) is equal to the expected loss if we take \(m\) training points, averaged across all possible functions that could label the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-distr-error.svg"> </p>

<p>Recall that, from above, we care about taking the <strong>maximum</strong> error across all possible distributions; by definition, this will be at least as big as the <strong>average</strong> loss across all distributions. Thus, we know that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-distr-training.svg"> </p>

<p>Next, it doesn't really matter if we take the average over all distributions first or the average over all training sets first. Thus, we can switch the order of the summations to get the same value:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) =\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-training-distr.svg"></p>

<p>Now, if we're taking the loss averaged over all training data, notice that this will necessarily have to be at least as big as the loss given by the training data which leads to the <strong>smallest</strong> average loss. </p>

<p>Thus, we can replace our inequality with a smaller, simpler one. Our inequality has to be at least as large as the average loss (across all functions) when applied to that specific training set.</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \underset{j \in [k]}{\text{min }} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-training-error.svg"> </p>

<p>So we've been abstractly talking about the loss function for a while now. What does \(L_{D_i}(h)\) actually represent? We want it to be how well our hypothesis does on a specific distribution \(D_i\). One straightforward way to formalize this is to just go through all \((x,y)\) pairs in \(D_i\) and take the average <strong>1</strong> loss between \(y\) and \(h(x)\):</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss.svg"></p>

<p>Next, let's fix some \(j \in [k]\), which has \(m\) training examples given by \(S_j = (x_1,..,x_m)\). Let \((v_1, ...,v_p)\) be the examples in \(C\) (all data points) that <strong>aren't</strong> in \(S_j\). We can see that \(p \ge m\) because at most we have half the data from the distribution, which is when we have no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/p-data.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) =\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)] \ge \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss-p.svg"> </p>

<p>In other words, the average loss over all points in the distribution is at least half of the average loss over all points <strong>not</strong> in the training set. </p>

<p>Now, we can substitutue this in for \(L_{D_i}\) from our inequality earlier to get:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p>So now we're taking the loss across all functions, across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\). Like before, we can swap the order of the summations:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] =\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-p-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Once again, we can upper bound this inequality by noticing that the average loss across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\) and across all functions has to be at least the loss of the point \(v_r\) which we assume to be the point which gives the minimal loss:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] \ge \frac{1}{2}\underset{r \in [p]}{\text{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_r) \not= f_i(v_r)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-p-error.svg"></p>

<p>Now, notice that we can partition \([T]\) into \((f_a, f_b)\) pairs such that \(f_a\) and \(f_b\) agree on every value except …</p></div></div>
