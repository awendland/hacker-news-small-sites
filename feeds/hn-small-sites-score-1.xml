    <p>The programming world is moving towards functional programming (FP). More developers are using languages with an explicit bias towards FP, such as Scala and Haskell, while object-oriented (OO) languages and their communities adopt FP features and practices. (A striking example of the latter is the rise of Typescript and React in the Javascript community.) So what is FP and what does it mean to write code in a functional style? It’s common to view functional programming as a collection of language features, such as first class functions, or to define it as a programming style using immutable data and pure functions. (Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.) This was my view when I started down the FP route, but I now believe the true goals of FP are enabling local reasoning and composition. Language features and programming style are in service of these goals. In this post I attempt to explain the meaning and value of local reasoning and composition.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-is">What Functional Programming Is</h2>
<p>I believe that functional programming is a hypothesis about software quality: that software that can be understood before it is run and is built of small reusable components is easier to write and maintain. The first property is known as local reasoning, and the second as composition. Let’s address each in turn.</p>
<p>Local reasoning means we can understand pieces of code in isolation. When we see the expression <code>1 + 1</code> we know what it means regardless of the weather, the database, or the current status of our Kubernetes cluster. None of these external events can change it. This is a trivial and slightly silly example, but it illustrates a point. A goal of functional programming is to extend this ability across our code base.</p>
<p>It can help to understand local reasoning by looking at what it is not. Shared mutable state is out because relying on shared state means that other code can change what our code does without our knowledge. It means no global mutable configuration, as found in many web frameworks and graphics libraries for example, as any random code can change that configuration. Metaprogramming has to be carefully controlled. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>, for example, as again it allows other code to change our code in non-obvious ways. As we can see, adapting code to enable local reasoning can mean quite some sweeping changes. However if we work in a language that embraces functional programming this style of programming is the default.</p>
<p>Composition means building big things out of smaller things. Numbers are compositional. We can take any number and add one, giving us a new number. Lego is also compositional. We compose Lego by sticking it together. In the particular sense we’re using composition we also require the original elements we combine don’t change in any way when they are composed. When we create by <code>2</code> by adding <code>1</code> and <code>1</code> we get a new result but we don’t change what <code>1</code> means.</p>
<p>We can find compositional ways to model common programming tasks once we start looking for them. React components are one example familiar to many front-end developers: a component can consist of many components. HTTP routes can be modelled in a compositional way. A route is a function from an HTTP request to a handler function or a value indicating the route did not match. We can combine routes as a logical or: try this route or, if it doesn’t match, try this other route. Processing pipelines are another example that often use sequential composition: perform this pipeline stage and then this other pipeline stage.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Types are not strictly part of functional programming but statically typed FP is the most popular form of FP and sufficiently important to warrant a mention. Types help compilers generate efficient code but types in FP are as much for the programmer as they are the compiler. Types express properties of programs, and the type checker automatically ensures that these properties hold. They can tell us, for example, what a function accepts and what it returns, or that a value is optional. We can also use types to express our beliefs about a program and the type checker will tell us if those beliefs are incorrect. For example, we can use types to tell the compiler we do not expect an error at a particular point in our code and the type checker will let us know if have made an incorrect assumption. In this way types are another tool for reasoning about code.</p>
<p>Type systems push programs towards particular designs, as to work effectively with the type checker requires designing code in a way the type checker can understand. As modern type systems come to other languages they naturally tend to shift programmers in those languages towards a FP style of coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-isn%E2%80%99t">What Functional Programming Isn’t</h2>
<p>In my view functional programming is not about immutability, or keeping to “the substitution model of evaluation”, and so on. These are tools in service of the goals of enabling local reasoning and composition, but they are not the goals themselves. Code that is immutable always allows local reasoning, for example, but it is not necessary to avoid mutation to still have local reasoning. Here is an example of summing a collection of numbers. First we have the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>numbers<span>:</span> Array<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>:</span> number <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    numbers<span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> total<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same function in Scala:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> sum<span>(</span>numbers<span>:</span> List<span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>var</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>  numbers<span>.</span>foreach<span>(</span>x <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span></span><br><span>  total</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In both implementations we mutate <code>total</code>. This is ok though! We cannot tell from the outside that this is done, and therefore all users of <code>sum</code> can still use local reasoning. Inside <code>sum</code> we have to be careful when we reason about <code>total</code> but this block of code is small enough that it shouldn’t cause any problems.</p>
<p>In this case we can reason about our code despite the mutation, but neither the Typescript nor the Scala compiler can determine that this is ok. Both languages allow mutation but it’s up to us to use it appropriately. A more expressive type system, perhaps with features like Rust’s, would be able to tell that <code>sum</code> doesn’t allow mutation to be observed by other parts of the system<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Another approach, which is the one taken by Haskell, is to disallow all mutation and thus guarantee it cannot cause problems.</p>
<p>Mutation also interferes with composition. For example, if a value relies on internal state then composing it may produce unexpected results. Consider generators in Javascript. They maintain internal state that is used to generate the next value. If we have two generators we might want to combine them into one generator that yields values from the two inputs. Here’s the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span>type Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> Generator<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span> never<span>&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>yield</span> index<span>++</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> zip<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>left<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> right<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>b<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span><span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>zipIt</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> l <span>=</span> left<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> r <span>=</span> right<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>l<span>.</span>done <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>r<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>const</span> result<span>:</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>l<span>.</span>value<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>value<span>]</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>            <span>yield</span> result<span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>zipIt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This works if we pass two distinct generators to <code>zip</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>However if we pass the same generator twice we get a surprising result.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> inf <span>=</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span>inf<span>,</span> inf<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>The usual functional programming solution is to avoid mutable state but we can envisage other possibilities. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect tracking system</a> would allow us to avoid combining two generators that use the same memory region. These systems are still research projects, however.</p>
<p>So in my opinion immutability (and purity, referential transparency, and no doubt more fancy words that I have forgotten) have become associated with functional programming because they guarantee local reasoning and composition, and until recently we didn’t have the language tools to automatically distinguish safe uses of mutation from those that cause problems. Restricting ourselves to immutability is the easiest way to ensure the desirable properties of functional programming, but as languages evolve this might come to be regarded as a historical artifact.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>I have described local reasoning and composition but have not discussed their benefits. Why are they are desirable? The answer is that they make efficient use of knowledge. Let me expand on this.</p>
<p>We care about local reasoning because it allows our ability to understand code to scale with the size of the code base. We can understand module A and module B in isolation, and our understanding does not change when we bring them together in the same program. By definition if both A and B allow local reasoning there is no way that B (or any other code) can change our understanding of A, and vice versa. If we don’t have local reasoning every new line of code can force us to revisit the rest of the code base to understand what has changed. This means it becomes exponentially harder to understand code as it grows in size as the number of interactions (and hence possible behaviours) grows exponentially. We can say that local reasoning is compositional. Our understanding of module A calling module B is just our understanding of A, our understanding of B, and whatever calls A makes to B.</p>
<p>We introduced numbers and Lego as examples of composition. They have an interesting property in common: the operations that we can use to combine them (for example, addition, subtraction, and so on for numbers; for Lego the operation is “sticking bricks together”) give us back the same kind of thing. A number multiplied by a number is a number. Two bits of Lego stuck together is still Lego. This property is called closure: when you combine things you end up with the same kind of thing. Closure means you can apply the combining operations (sometimes called combinators) an arbitrary number of times. No matter how many times you add one to a number you still …</p></div></div>

Writing programs in Python takes less time than other languages. It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time. It also supports large set of libraries and built-in modules.</p><p>

Django is a free and open-source Web Framework in Python,that encourages rapid development and clean, programatic design. It follows MVT Architecture. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes re-usability and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p><p>

This Course is designed for the beginners, and no prerequisites have been defined.</p><p>

This Python training course begins with the basic concepts of python programming and works upward to full-fledged web application development using Django.</p></div>

          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.

        <p>
          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.

            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

Without setting any servers, we can do a lot of things like <a href="https://www.ravsam.in/blog/collect-form-responses-using-google-apps-script/">collecting form responses</a>, email marketing campaigns, etc. But as a developer, we like our code to be on Version Control System like Github. In this blog, we will discuss how can you setup Github Actions to automatically backup your Google Apps Scripts to Github.</p><h3 id="contents">Contents</h3><ol><li><a href="#1-installing-clasp">Installing Clasp</a></li><li><a href="#2-creating-a-new-repository">Creating a new Repository</a></li><li><a href="#3-adding-important-files">Adding Important Files</a></li><li><a href="#4-setting-up-github-actions">Setting up Github Actions</a></li><li><a href="#5-adding-github-actions-secrets">Adding Github Actions Secrets</a></li><li><a href="#results">Results</a></li></ol><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>Before getting started, we assume that you have set up the following:</p><ul><li>A Google Apps Script Project</li><li>A Github Account</li></ul><h2 id="1-installing-clasp">1. Installing Clasp</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/google/clasp">Clasp</a> is a Google tool to develop Apps Script projects locally. It is short for <strong>Command-Line Apps Script Projects</strong>. Setting up Clasp is simple. Follow this <a href="https://github.com/google/clasp#readme">amazing guide</a> by Google to get your login credentials, which we will be using later while setting up Github Actions.</p><p>Once you have successfully logged in, use the following command to get the content of the credentials file.</p><h2 id="2-creating-a-new-repository">2. Creating a new Repository</h2><p>Depending upon your requirement, create a new public/private repository at <a href="https://repo.new/">Github</a>. Once you have created a new repository, add a .gitignore file with the following content:</p><p>This prevents our credential file to be committed back to the repository.</p><h2 id="3-adding-important-files">3. Adding important files</h2><p>Now it’s time to add some new files to the repository.</p><p>a.) <strong>setup.sh</strong></p><p>This script will prevent us from logging in again by using our already logged in credentials from Github Actions secrets, which we will be setting up later.

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

            <h2>Mastodon bad. Pleroma good.</h2>
            <p>If you’ve been following me on the fediverse, you would’ve witnessed my
numerous (failed) attempts at migrating from Mastodon to Pleroma,
running on my Raspberry Pi. I finally got it working, and these are the
steps I took. It’s sort of a loose guide you could follow, but I can’t
promise it’ll work for you.</p>

<p>The Erlang and Elixir packages are pretty broken and outdated on
Raspbian. So this time, I built them from source.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> I also assume
you have Mastodon and Pleroma (source, not OTP) installed—probably at
<code>/home/mastodon/live</code> and <code>/opt/pleroma</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>Once you have Erlang and Elixir compiled and sitting in your <code>PATH</code>,
pull <a href="https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/migrator">soapbox-pub/migrator</a>.
Now read the readme and the <code>do_migration.sh</code> script to get an idea of
what you’re getting into.</p>

<p>Move into the cloned directory and create a <code>.env</code>:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>MASTODON_PATH</span><span>=</span>/home/mastodon/live
<span>PLEROMA_PATH</span><span>=</span>/opt/pleroma
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, run:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> yarn   <span># install deps</span>
<span>$</span> cp -r mastodon/* /home/mastodon/live
<span>$</span> cp -r pleroma/* /opt/pleroma
<span>$</span> <span>RAILS_ENV</span><span>=</span>production yarn masto <span>export</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you run into any permissions issues, <code>chown</code> and proceed. This should
export all your Mastodon activity into <code>/home/mastodon/live/migrator</code>.
Now, copy the <code>migrator</code> directory into your Pleroma installation path.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> cp -r migrator /opt/pleroma
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then import all of it into Pleroma (possibly prefixed with <code>sudo
-Hu pleroma</code>):</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> <span>MIX_ENV</span><span>=</span>prod mix migrator.import
</code></pre></div>

<p>If all went well, you would’ve successfully migrated from Mastodon to
Pleroma. If not, well feel free to send me an email (or @ me on the fedi).
I suppose you could also reach <a href="https://alexgleason.me/">Alex</a>—he’s
the incredibly based guy who wrote the migrator,
<a href="https://soapbox.pub/">soapbox-fe</a> and does some Elixir magic he keeps
<a href="https://gleasonator.com/@alex">posting about</a>.</p>

<p>Rest assured, the migrator has a 100% success rate—Alex and I are
apparently the only two who have it working. 2/2.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-migrate">why should you migrate?</h2>

<p>Because Pleroma is cleaner, leaner<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> and prettier looking<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. Oh, and we
have chats.

It was disclosed in August that the national AI strategy presented by the authority had been <span><a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/2020/08/12/saudi-national-ai-strategy-approved/">approved by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud</a></span>. PWC has forecast that AI could contribute $135 billion (or 12.4%) to Saudi Arabia’s GDP by the year 2030.</p>
<p>Established by royal decree in August 2019, the SDAIA was given the mandate to drive the national data and AI agenda for transforming the country into a leading data-driven economy, and has developed Saudi Arabia’s national AI strategy over the past year. Although the details of the plan have been kept under wraps, the new strategy is expected to contribute to 66 of the country’s strategic goals, which are directly or indirectly related to data and AI.</p>
<p>The SDAIA has already reached a number of milestones since its inception, establishing three specialised centres of expertise: the National Information Center, the National Data Management Office and the National Center for AI. It has also begun building one of the largest data clouds in the region by merging 83 data centres owned by over 40 Saudi government bodies. More than 80 percent of government datasets have so far been consolidated under a national data bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the authority has been using AI to identify opportunities for improving the Kingdom’s government processes, which may result in some $10 billion in government savings and additional revenues.</p>
<p>Originally slated for March 2020, the Global AI Summit will discuss AI, its applications, impact on social and economic development, plus global challenges and opportunities. The event aims to connect key decision makers from government and public sector, academia, industry and enterprise, tech firms, investors, entrepreneurs and startups.</p>
<p>October’s virtual summit will be organised into four tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Shaping the new normal;</li>
<li>AI and governments;</li>
<li>Governing AI; and</li>
<li>The future of AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Global AI Summit aims to tackle the challenges faced by countries around the world, from technical to ethical. Details of the agenda and speaker platform for the Global AI Summit have yet to be announced, although the presentation of the Saudi national artificial intelligence strategy is bound to be a highlight.</p>

Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

<div>
<div>
 <div>
<p>The PixLab development team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the <strong><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">PixLab API 1.9.72</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pixlab.io/images/pix.png" alt="PixLab Logo"></p>
<p>Since its launch on 2017, PixLab have already processed over 450 Millions of users contents whether static images, GIF or Videos Frames.
<strong>This milestone release introduces new <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">API endpoints</a>, various minor bug fixes, processing speed improvements by up to 5% and many innovative features</strong>.
Let's start with the one we are existed about in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">Passports &amp; ID Cards Scan</a>: While documents scanning were introduced in earlier version of the PixLab API via the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> endpoint. This release pushes further the accuracy of the OCR engine. <strong>A 5MB raw Passport sample now takes less than 3 seconds to execute</strong> including face detection &amp; extraction, MRZ (<em>Machine Readable Zone</em>) extraction and finally transformation of the Raw MRZ data into textual content. You can try out the accuracy of the <strong>Passport scanning engine</strong> using these <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/symisc/3a8df5c54e427ec1781515ceb27965e4">Python</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/symisc/ca211ac7ff38ddcaab102e98fe5a7fa9">PHP</a></strong> scripts to see it in action.</li>
<li>DNS infrastructure moved to <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> for faster than ever response times.</li>
<li>Full support for <strong>HTTP/2</strong> and <strong>HTTP/3 (QUIC)</strong>.</li>
<li>Up to <strong>three layers of redundancy</strong> for the standard <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=ocr">PixLab OCR engine</a> for faster, accurate &amp; guaranteed scan results.</li>
<li>A fresh update of the <strong>adult &amp; gore content detection ML model</strong> which is used to power the famous PixLab /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=nsfw">NSFW</a> API endpoint that have already analyzed over 100 millions of user contents with high accuracy.</li>
<li><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facedetect">Face Detection</a> (including <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facelandmarks">facial landmarks</a> extraction) &amp; <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facemotion">Emotion Pattern</a> (including gender &amp; age) extraction are now using the RetinaFace Model which scores the highest on the LFW dataset.</li>
<li>The /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint now fully support scanning ID cards from <a href="https://blog.pixlab.io/2019/11/docscan-api-endpoint-support-id-cards-passports">Malaysia &amp; Singapore</a> and many other countries (at users request) as well the brand new <strong>India Aadhar ID card</strong>. Find out more information about <strong>Aadhard fully support</strong> via our blog announcement <a href="https://blog.pixlab.io/2020/03/full-scan-support-for-india-aadhar-id-card">here</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, a brand new, high performance custom image processing layer written in C/C++ and powered by <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> and our <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/">Embedded computer Vision Library SOD</a> is integrated directly into our cloud API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pixlab customers are more than advised to take a look at <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">The official API endpoints documentation</a>, <a href="https://pixlab.io/examples">The Samples Page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/symisc/pixlab">The Github repository</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>Finally, for potentially interested users, you are more than welcome to <strong>start a 7 days free trial</strong> to see the API in action. Simply head to the <a href="https://pixlab.io/dashboard">PixLab Dashboard</a> and activate your free trial from there.</p>

September 4, 2020 | https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-hetzner-hcloud/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-hetzner-hcloud/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In a number of posts on this site I have covered Prometheus and some of the service discovery methods, including: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-node_exporter/">Consul</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-srv-discovery/">DNS SRV Records</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">OpenStack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next release of Prometheus (v2.21 at the time of writing) Prometheus will also be able to discover services for <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> and <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the v2.21 release of Prometheus is available as a Release Candidate (available <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.21.0-rc.0">here</a>), meaning we do not need to compile Prometheus from source to make use of it. However if you intend to run this in production, it is advisable to wait for final release.</p>
<h2 id="hetzner">Hetzner</h2>
<h3 id="who-are-hetzner">Who are Hetzner?</h3>
<p>Hetzner are a German hosting company and data centre operator. They run data centres in three locations (Nuremberg, Falkenstein and Helsinki in Finland), and can provide everything from webmail to dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Hetzner’s <a href="https://robot.your-server.de/">Robot</a> is the name they give to their dedicated server offering. The Hetner <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">Cloud</a> provides virtual servers, load balancers, private networking and more.</p>
<p>The Prometheus Service Discovery isable discover servers from both Robot and Cloud.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-account">Creating an account</h3>
<p>To sign up with Hetzner’s Cloud, go to the Hetzner <a href="https://accounts.hetzner.com/signUp">Account Sign-Up</a> page. This will create an account which is usable across all of Hetzner’s products.</p>
<p>Once you have created an account, you will be asked to create a project like so: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-addnewproject.png" alt="Add new project"></p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-addnewproject-name.png" alt="Add new project - name"></p>
<p>Currently you cannot create resources in a specific project using Terraform, nor can you limit targets by project in Prometheus, so what name you choose is arbitrary.</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>There is an official <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hetznercloud/hcloud/latest">Terraform Provider</a> for Hetzner’s Cloud offering which will allow us to create virtual servers ready to be discovered by Prometheus.</p>
<p>For information on how to install Terraform and an examaple project structure, see <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/#configure-terraform">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="create-an-api-token">Create an API Token</h3>
<p>Terraform uses Hetzner Cloud API keys to authenticate and provision resources. You can generate a key in the <strong>Security</strong> section of the <a href="https://console.hetzner.cloud/">Hetzner Cloud Console</a>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-security.png" alt="Hetzner Cloud Security"></p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-generateapitoken.png" alt="Hetzner Cloud - Generate API Key"></p>
<p>You can configure the API Token directly in the Terraform provider configuration: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>provider</span> <span>"hcloud"</span> {
  token <span>=</span> <span>"$API_TOKEN"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, you can set an environment variable of <code>HCLOUD_TOKEN="$API_TOKEN"</code> (eg <code>export HCLOUD_TOKEN="$API_TOKEN"</code>) that the Terraform provider will use instead.</p>
<p>If you are using Terraform version 0.13, you can also add the <code>hcloud</code> provider to your list of required providers like so: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>terraform</span> {
  <span>required_providers</span> {
    hcloud <span>=</span> {
      source <span>=</span> <span>"hetznercloud/hcloud"</span>
    }
    template <span>=</span> {
      source <span>=</span> <span>"hashicorp/template"</span>
    }
  }
  required_version <span>=</span> "&gt;<span>=</span> <span>0</span>.<span>13</span><span>"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This configuration goes in a <code>versions.tf</code> file in the <code>basic-vms</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="configure-terraform---virtual-servers">Configure Terraform - Virtual Servers</h3>
<p>Now that we have created an API token and configured the provider, we can create our Hetzner Cloud virtual servers.</p>
<p>Run <code>terraform init</code> to download and install the provider: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ terraform init 

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

- Installed hetznercloud/hcloud v1.20.1 <span>(</span>signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 5219EACB3A77198B<span>)</span>
- Installing hashicorp/template v2.1.2...
- Installed hashicorp/template v2.1.2 <span>(</span>signed by HashiCorp<span>)</span>

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you<span>'</span>d like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html

The following providers <span>do</span> not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* hashicorp/template: version <span>=</span> <span>"~&gt; 2.1.2"</span>
* hetznercloud/hcloud: version <span>=</span> <span>"~&gt; 1.20.1"</span>

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running <span>"terraform plan"</span> to see
any changes that are required <span>for</span> your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration <span>for</span> Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to <span>do</span> so <span>if</span> necessary.
</code></pre></div><h3 id="define-the-infrastructure---virtual-servers">Define the infrastructure - Virtual Servers</h3>
<p>You can now create the configuration files for your first virtual server. The below is from the file <code>hcloud.tf</code> in the <code>terraform/basic-vms</code> directory: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>resource</span> <span>"hcloud_server" "yetiops-blog"</span> {
  name               <span>=</span> <span>"yetiops-blog"</span>
  image              <span>=</span> <span>"ubuntu-20.04"</span>
  server_type        <span>=</span> <span>"cx11"</span>
  user_data          <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>template_file</span>.<span>ubuntu</span>.<span>rendered</span>
  ssh_keys           <span>=</span> [
    <span>hcloud_ssh_key</span>.<span>yetiops</span><span>-</span><span>ssh</span><span>-</span><span>key</span>.<span>name</span>
  ]
  labels <span>=</span> {
    "prometheus" <span>=</span> <span>"true"</span>,
    "node_exporter" <span>=</span> <span>"true"</span>
  }
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"hcloud_ssh_key" "yetiops-ssh-key"</span> {
  name       <span>=</span> <span>"yetiops-ssh-key"</span>
  public_key <span>=</span> <span>file</span>(<span>"~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"</span>)
}

<span>output</span> <span>"yetiops_blog_ipv4"</span> {
  value <span>=</span> <span>hcloud_server</span>.<span>yetiops</span><span>-</span><span>blog</span>.<span>ipv4_address</span>
}

<span>output</span> <span>"yetiops_blog_ipv6"</span> {
  value <span>=</span> <span>hcloud_server</span>.<span>yetiops</span><span>-</span><span>blog</span>.<span>ipv6_address</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Compared to some of the other posts, we are creating a small amount of infrastructure. This is because: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Hetzner Cloud does not provide firewall/security group resources (like an AWS Security Group or a Digital Ocean Firewall)</li>
<li>While you can specify a datacentre, Hetzner will choose one at random if you do not (rather than it being a prerequisite of creating an instance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hetzner Cloud instances support labels for instances (consisting of key-value pairs). These can then be used to filter/match instances with Prometheus later.</p>
<p>We have also added some Terraform outputs as well. Outputs can be used in Terraform modules to expose attributes to state files that call the modules, or they can be used to show information when Terraform finishes an <code>apply</code> operation.</p>
<p>One part that does differ from our previous posts is that we extend the <code>user-data</code> being provided. This create a basic host-based firewall (leveraging <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW">UFW</a>) on the server: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span>
<span>packages</span>:
 - prometheus-node-exporter

<span>ufw_enable</span>:
  - <span>&amp;ufw_enable</span> <span>|
</span><span>    ufw allow from ${my_ip}</span>
    ufw enable

<span>runcmd</span>:
   - [ sh, -c, <span>*ufw_enable</span> ]
</code></pre></div><p>We now also need to supply our IP as part of this: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>data</span> <span>"template_file" "ubuntu"</span> {
  template <span>=</span> <span>"${file("${path.module}/files/ubuntu.tpl")}"</span>
  vars <span>=</span> {
    my_ip <span>=</span> <span>"###MY PUBLIC IP ADDRESS###"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>You could also use IPTables, nftables, firewalld or any other host-based firewall of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="build-the-infrastructure---virtual-servers">Build the infrastructure - Virtual Servers</h3>
<p>We can now apply our configuration, and see if it builds a Hetzner Cloud virtual server: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ terraform apply
data.template_file.ubuntu: Refreshing state...
data.template_cloudinit_config.ubuntu: Refreshing state...

				<p>The conventional wisdom for app subscriptions is to price affordably, like $1.99/month, and hopefully attract lots of subscribers at a low price. Then by having low pricing, fewer will reject the idea of subscriptions, and you’ll make up the difference with volume. But this is the wrong approach…</p>

<p><b>The reality is most people won’t sign up for your subscription even at a low price. </b>Most people dislike subscriptions, and many won’t subscribe at any cost.&nbsp;The recurring nature of subscriptions provides a major mental hurdle and makes them hard to commit to.</p>
<p>However, you likely have a smaller set of users who get the most value out of your app and are willing to subscribe. These are your most devoted and die-hard users. When designing your subscription plan you want to focus on these users, they are the ones who will pay and stick around (see my <a href="https://mronge.com/how-churn-can-limit-your-subscription-business/">post on churn</a> for why this is critical). <strong>By going subscription, you are choosing to focus on fewer customers but your most dedicated customers.</strong> Given that this is a much smaller customer base, you need to charge a higher price.</p>
<p>There is such a mental barrier with subscriptions that once someone is willing to purchase, they are likely less price sensitive. If someone is willing to buy at $1.99/month, they are very likely to buy at $4.99/month or even $7.99/month. Our surveys conducted before launching Astropad Studio show this as well:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Price</strong></td>
<td>
<p>$50 One-time</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$20 Yearly</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$50 Yearly</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$100 Yearly</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Conversion %</strong></td>
<td>
<p>45%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>38%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>21%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>15%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Revenue per 10k visitors</strong></td>
<td>
<p>$223,549</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$75,524</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$106,007</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$147,887</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This is real data from a test on potential pricing schemes for a new app. The first thing you’ll notice is that people are much more willing to make a one-time purchase.</p>
<p>Second, if we compare the number of people willing to purchase a $20/year subscription vs. the number of people ready to buy a $100/year subscription, you’ll notice that 2.5x fewer people are willing to pay $100/year<b>.</b> But while we have 2.5x fewer people at $100/year, our price has gone up by 5x! Looking at the estimates for revenue per 10,000 visitors clearly shows as well, <b>we would make 2x as much revenue at $100/year than we would at just $20/year!</b></p>
<p>So if you’re going to make the switch to subscription (and I’ll be writing another post on why I think it is the right choice for productivity apps) you should focus on your best customers and charge them more. Not only will you generate more revenue with which to grow, but customers that purchase at higher prices tend to churn less (and we know <a href="https://mronge.com/how-churn-can-limit-your-subscription-business/">how churn can be a killer</a>). So raise your subscription prices!</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Everybody claims to be a software company these days. From the nearly decade old pronouncement by Marc Andressen that <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">“Software Is Eating the World”</a> to the push from Wall Street to produce recurring software revenue; the pressure is on to claim - at least - that you are a software company. <br></p><p>This is obviously problematic for appliance vendors. Try as they might, it does not take much inspection to determine which ones have become truly software defined, and which ones are hoping to use financial engineering to fake it until they get there. <br></p><p>Either way, the ongoing debate about which is better, software defined storage or hardware storage appliances. Is pretty much over. <br></p><p>Like Marc predicted, software won. <br></p><p>We need to start with a clear definition of software defined storage. First of all, it is software. It most likely started as software too - it wasn’t “extracted” from a proprietary hardware platform. <br></p><p>Software defined storage should run on multiple customer servers with direct access storage (DAS) SSDs or disk drives or JBoDs (just a bunch of disks) or JBoF (just a bunch of flash) shelves that are SAS/NVMe attached to the servers. <br></p><p>True software defined storage doesn’t run on a narrow list of pre-approved boxes - that is just hardware defined storage with choices. Software defined storage should run on almost anything. For example a <a href="https://github.com/christianbaun/ossperf/wiki/Minio-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-3-with-Raspbian-(Debian-Jessie-8.0)">Raspberry Pi</a>. Or <a href="https://min.io/resources/docs/MinIO-POWER-whitepaper-HR.pdf">IBM Power9 infrastructure</a>. Or anything <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware">in-between</a>.<br></p><p>Hardware defined storage (appliances) combine server and storage hardware and software into one packaged solution that a customer buys whole from that vendor. Hardware defined storage is normally deployed by vendor personnel and can take the form of rackable hardware with vendor covers but underneath, is typically two or more servers with SAS or NVMe storage shelves attached. Hardware defined storage vendors provide the internal networking to connect the multiple servers and storage together. The appliance vendor personnel are responsible for servicing the appliance server and storage hardware as well as the storage software. <br></p><p>Let’s break it down further shall we?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Software Defined</th>
<th>Hardware Defined/Appliance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Superior. The customer supplies <br>their own servers &amp; storage <br>designed for the price/performance <br>configuration the deployment <br>calls for.</td>
<td>Worse. The storage vendor supplies <br>all of the hardware,<br>software and service for <br>the solution. Difficult to unbundle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Dependent on what is provisioned. <br>True high performance SDS on <br>fast HW and a fast network <br>outperforms even the “fast” <br>appliance vendors. This trend<br>will only continue. To be sure, <br>there will be niche cases <br>- but fast software is the <br>starting point.</td>
<td>Vendors optimize hardware and <br>software to get the most <br>performance and availability <br>out of the system. Price/Performance <br>curves are pretty linear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scalability</td>
<td>Better, as these are deployed <br>as a storage cluster, they <br>can often range from 3-4 nodes<br>to 100s of nodes and anything<br>in between.</td>
<td>Worse. Appliances typically come <br>with dual (server) controllers<br>and can typically scale up<br>to 4 of these (8 servers) <br>but generally not much higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fault <br>tolerance</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>treats failure as a normal event. <br>Done well, clusters seamlessly <br>redirect, heal or recover. <br>Sophisticated erasure-coding <br>and bitrot protection are software<br>inventions - and ensure manageability is <br>prioritized.</td>
<td>Appliances are generally optimized<br>for providing high levels of<br>fault tolerance. They are <br>typically deployed with dual <br>controllers that quickly failover <br>when one dies and provide <br>sophisticated storage protection <br>policies. Replacing the appliance <br>is not the same, however, as <br>replacing COTS hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automation</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API driven. These APIs typically <br>support most DevOps and <br>infrastructure automation and <br>monitoring packages currently <br>deployed in a data center.</td>
<td>Appliances generally support a <br>GUI first and APIs as second-class<br>citizens, if at all. This limits <br>automation and application failure <br>management. It is why most appliances<br>are only used for archival and not <br>modern apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration <br>flexibility</td>
<td>Customers deploy these solutions <br>on whatever performance and <br>capacity they want (within HCLs). <br>The configuration flexibility is <br>nearly infinite - critical when <br>considering the modern range <br>(data center to edge).</td>
<td>Appliances typically limit options <br>to very specific offerings, <br>generally 3-5 models are available <br>with DRAM &amp; capacity limits for <br>each model. Performance is often <br>limited by the appliance model <br>selected. Mixing and matching <br>models is a no-no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trialability</td>
<td>Want to try out software <br>defined storage - download it <br>and get started. If your <br>provider is truly open source<br>- what you are playing with <br>is the same software their <br>best customers run.</td>
<td>Appliances must be made available <br>to the customer on their data <br>center premises or at some other <br>test facility to be tried out. <br>Massive friction in the sales process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upgradeability</td>
<td>Customers can switch out <br>current servers or storage <br>with better ones anytime <br>they want and do <br>this themselves.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors generally <br>offer only specific model <br>upgrades to appliances which <br>have to be purchased and <br>are typically done by vendor <br>personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of installation</td>
<td>Better. As customers add <br>server or storage hardware <br>and deploy software on servers <br>all the time, they <br>can deploy software defined <br>storage on current or new servers <br>anytime they want.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors personnel are <br>typically used to deploy the <br>appliances. This may require <br>cross scheduling of data center <br>and vendor service personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of operations</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API first, but also supports <br>GUIs and/or are integrated <br>into larger solution interfaces <br>(think MinIO + Cisco).</td>
<td>Application vendors have invested <br>heavily in their GUI’s and <br>they are typically fully featured. <br>A good GUI can be a powerful form<br>of lock-in with IT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature <br>update frequency</td>
<td>True software defined storage <br>releases continuously. Often weekly. <br>Customers consume those on <br>demand. This means more features, <br>better security and less disruption.</td>
<td>Worse. Due to their tight <br>performance and availability <br>optimizations, testing must often <br>be more stringent and take <br>longer. This lengthens the interval <br>between feature <br>updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Footprint <br>density</td>
<td>Density traditionally favored appliances <br>- but with boxes like this, <br>that gap has been eliminated.</td>
<td>Appliances control the hardware, <br>and target the densest storage<br>shelves available - even if that<br>requires proprietary hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hardware <br>reuseability</td>
<td>Customers can take server and storage <br>hardware out of the cluster anytime <br>they wish and deploy this <br>for other uses. Licensing <br>terms may or may not need <br>to be changed. Server maintenance <br>options are at the discretion <br>of the customer and their <br>server vendor.</td>
<td>Other than using older appliances <br>as slower storage (aka boat anchors) <br>there’s not much that can be done <br>with it. However, to continue <br>to  use appliances as (slower) <br>storage , vendor maintenance contracts <br>will need to be maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Complexity</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>abstracts complexity. Great software <br>defined storage eliminates it.</td>
<td>A rare bright spot for appliance <br>vendors, the lack of flexibility <br>drives homogeneity and therefore <br>some semblance of simplicity. <br>It is why IT can be fiercely loyal<br>to their vendors.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Ultimately, there is a place for both solutions in the market today but the world is changing. <br></p><p>It burns a lot of cash to run a hardware appliance business. It ties up capital, requires large field sales and field sales support. Appliances are not built for the world we live in today. Further, as we have most famously pointed out - you <a href="https://blog.min.io/high-performance-object-storage-with-kubernetes/">can’t containerize an appliance</a>. Given that Kubernetes is the new normal - it is going to be increasingly difficult to make a living slinging steel. <br></p><p>That is why everyone is eager to say they are a “software-company” these days. Truth is, if their website is adorned with boxes showcasing their logo - it is not a software company. When they tweet a win and show some boxes, that is what they sold - not software. Just because for 45 mins every three months they say words like “revenue from software subscriptions” doesn’t mean they are a software company - it means they are on their quarterly analyst call. <br></p><p>So think about what you really want to achieve. If you want high-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage - choose software. If you want modern application support in addition to archival - choose software. If you want flexibility to design to your use case - choose software. <br></p><p>Don’t, however, choose hardware masquerading as software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>It's what every Node developer fears: the process that keeps eating memory and won't stop, or the infamous <code>ENOMEM</code> code being returned by your <code>child_process</code> calls. That's right we're talking about memory leaks today folks, and more specifically the NodeJS kind.</p>
<p>However, instead of taking a look at all the tools and packages out there, and going over each, I'd like to share the things that we used that directly lead us to find our particular leak. Unfortunately this will require you to install at least one package in your app and call it somehow, whether that be on a regular interval or via a triggered event of some kind. In any event, below is how we found, diagnosed, and fixed a particular memory leak that caused us some headaches in browserless.</p>
<!-- truncate -->
<h2>Install heapdump</h2>
<p>The first thing we reached for was the <code>npm</code> package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/heapdump"><code>heapdump</code></a>. This little utility generates portable <code>heapsnapshot</code>'s of V8's heap, which you can then directly import later into Chromium to debug (more on that later).</p>
<p>As for browserless, we decided to conditionally mount a route that exposes this functionality. The internals for <code>heapdump</code> are a little goofy since it <em>has</em> to write to disk, so you'll have to take that into consideration for your use-case.</p>
<p><strong>The heapdump route</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> os = <span>require</span>(<span>'os'</span>);
<span>const</span> rimraf = <span>require</span>(<span>'rimraf'</span>);
<span>const</span> _ = <span>require</span>(<span>'lodash'</span>);

<span>if</span> (process.env.NODE_ENV !== <span>'production'</span>) {
  <span>const</span> heapdump = <span>require</span>(<span>'heapdump'</span>);

  router.get(<span>'/heapdump'</span>, (req, res) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> heapLocation = path.join(os.tmpdir(), <span>`heap-<span>${<span>Date</span>.now()}</span>.heapsnapshot`</span>);
    heapdump.writeSnapshot(heapLocation, (err) =&gt; {
      <span>if</span> (err) {
        <span>return</span> res.status(<span>500</span>).send(err.message);
      }

      <span>return</span> res.sendFile(heapLocation, () =&gt; rimraf(heapLocation, (_.noop)));
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that we handle all the of details of the writing, sending, and deletion of this heap file. Be warned that the <code>heapdump.writeSnapshot</code> call is <em>expensive</em> as it effectively stops the single-process JavaScript runtime so that a dump can be made. This means that this isn't something you want to run on all your production machines -- and I wouldn't do so on any production machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>By no means should you run this route in your production infrastructure!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our purposes in debugging this leak, we instead built local docker images to hammer with traffic for the sole purpose of finding this issue. If this isn't an option, or if you don't have a way to test these changes in some kind of isolation, then you have bigger problems than a memory leak on your hands. We can't stress this enough: find a way to implement this in an isolated fashion.</p>
<p>Good? Now let's run some traffic!</p>
<h2>Make some traffic</h2>
<p>For browserless, since we expose a interface for puppeteer and playwright to hook into, we spun up our docker image with the below command:</p>
<pre><code>
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e ENABLE_HEAP_DUMP=<span>true</span> --rm --name browserless -d browserless/chrome:dev
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously you'll need to start your application with whatever it needs in order to run. After we got up and running, we did a cURL call to to our <code>/heapdump</code> route and got our first heapsnapshot. It's really important to get a "clean" snapshot before any processing or traffic happens, as we use this as a baseline for comparing later snapshots. It's nearly impossible to find a leak with doing some kind of comparison.</p>
<pre><code>
curl -o start.heapsnapshot http://localhost:3000/heapdump
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have our app up, and a baseline snapshot for comparing, let's run generate some traffic. For our purposes we simply wanted to generate a lot of connections and removals to see if that invoked our memory issue. This let us try out thousands of sessions to see if there was an issue in how we collect statistics of the machine itself, or if something else was at play.</p>
<p><strong>Simulate load</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> puppeteer = <span>require</span>(<span>'puppeteer'</span>);

<span>const</span> PARALLEL = <span>20</span>;
<span>const</span> SAMPLE = <span>100000</span>;

<span>let</span> currentIdx = <span>0</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(<span>`Stress testing with <span>${SAMPLE.toLocaleString()}</span> iterations.`</span>);

setInterval(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`On iteration: <span>${currentIdx.toLocaleString()}</span>.`</span>);
}, <span>5000</span>);

<span>const</span> run = <span>async</span> () =&gt; {
  <span>if</span> (currentIdx &gt;= SAMPLE) {
    <span>return</span>;
  }
  <span>let</span> browser;
  currentIdx++;

  <span>try</span> {
    browser = <span>await</span> puppeteer.connect({
      <span>browserWSEndpoint</span>: <span>'ws://localhost:3000'</span>
    });
  } <span>catch</span> (err) {
    <span>console</span>.error(err);
  } <span>finally</span> {
    browser &amp;&amp; browser.close();
    <span>return</span> run();
  }
};

<span>Promise</span>.all([...new <span>Array</span>(PARALLEL)].map(run))
  .then(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Complete!'</span>)
    process.exit(<span>0</span>);
  })
  .catch(<span>(<span>e</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.error(<span>`Error running stress script: <span>${e}</span>`</span>);
    process.exit(<span>1</span>);
  });

</code></pre>
<p>Once done, you'll simply have to wait. Depending on your case this could take a few minutes or even hours, so let things run for a bit and come back once you've got enough load generated.</p>
<hr>
<p>OK! Time's up! Let's get our second snapshot for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>
curl -o end.heapsnapshot http://localhost:3000/heapdump
</code></pre>
<h2>Load up your Chrome browser</h2>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with devtools on Chrome, then this is the part where I say go watch a few videos on that (seriously). Both NodeJS and Chrome share the same-ish V8 runtime, which means you can do cool stuff like profile and debug Node applications with Chrome! But in order to do that you'll need to have some familiarity with it, so please go do so now!</p>
<p>Once you're ready, open a new tab. The <code>about:blank</code> page is good as nothing happens on it, keeping everything clean. Once done open devtools.</p>
<p><strong>DevTools link</strong>
<img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/devtools.png" rel="Chrome Devtools"></p>
<p>After that you'll want to click the Memory tab to open the comparison tool we're after.</p>
<p><strong>Memory Tab</strong>
<img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/memory-tab.png" rel="Chrome Devtools"></p>
<p>Down below, you'll want to click that "Load" button the bottom of the frame. What this does is allow you to load the existing snapshots we've made into Chromium's debugger. You'll have to do each snapshot individually, and renaming them is helpful so you know when they were taken. In our case, we had both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> snapshots, so it made it easy for us to distinguish what was what.</p>
<p>Once you've loaded all your snapshots, your a few clicks away from more information than you can possibly ever need. Start by clicking the <em>last</em> snapshot in time (for us the <code>end</code> one). Then click the "Summary" tab and change it to "Comparison". Finally, sort by "Size Delta" ensuring that the biggest is first, or descending order.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison view</strong>
<img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/comparison.png" rel="Chrome Devtools"></p>
<p>What we're after here is Objects that are <em>growing</em> over time and never collected. In plain language, we're essentially telling Chrome that we want to compare these snapshots, and show us objects that have grown over time and are never collected.</p>
<p>Once done, you'll want to start clicking around the bottom half the page (Retainers). This give us some context on what it is that's growing and never being reaped.</p>
<h2>Leak location</h2>
<p>This next part, I'll admit, is somewhat confusing. We're essentially looking for anything in these never-collected objects that might trigger our "spider-sense" that there's an issue. Some of it is internal to Node, which will look like complete gibberish, and it's quite possible that your leak is in some other library or package. There's a lot of system strings that are quite biggish (which are your modules loaded into memory), so be sure to not get suspicious of those. It took us quite a bit of digging around, but the leak is found here:</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/leak-debug.gif" rel="Clicking around the debugger"></p>
<p>You'll notice that we instinctively clicked on the first item in this array object, and we're presented with a bunch of Objects below. Looking again at the "Retained Size", we immediately spotted that there's a huge <code>SIGHUP</code> object staying around. This is made even more clear by the fact that the lower "Retained Size" column is showing that these objects never get reaped again.</p>
<p>Clicking around, we also noticed that some other growing objects referenced these <code>SIGHUP</code> objects as well. Since browserless itself doesn't handle this signal, something somewhere must be. After searching around our <code>node_modules</code> libraries we found one culprit: <code>puppeteer</code>.</p>
<h2>Fixing the leak</h2>
<p>Now, puppeteer isn't directly responsible for this issue, however it does attach a lot of process handlers (not just <code>SIGHUP</code>, but <code>exit</code> and others). These do get closed when calling <code>browser.close()</code> -- which wasn't something that we were doing! Instead, we <code>disconnected</code> from the browser, and sent our own process kill message to it. When running many instance of puppeteer in a server environment, this becomes problematic, especially in docker.</p>
<p>In docker, we do signal handling manually by binding our own event listeners and forwarding that intention to all running browser instances in order to close gracefully. Once done, we <em>then</em> exit the process, meaning that puppeteer doesn't really need to handle any of that for us. Luckily their API exposes what events to bind to <em>except</em> for the <code>exit</code> event. This means that we fixed this leak by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Telling puppeteer <em>not</em> to handle signals (<a href="https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&amp;version=v5.2.1&amp;show=api-puppeteerlaunchoptions">see their API here</a>).</li>
<li>Triggering its event cleanup process by using <code>browser.close</code> instead of <code>browser.disconnect</code>.</li>
<li>Since the <code>exit</code> handler isn't always reaped by <code>browser.close()</code> in cases of crashes, we force it by periodically calling <code>process.removeAllListeners('exit')</code>. <strong>Be careful with this one</strong>, it's a ham-fisted way to make sure exit events get removed, and can cause issues if other parts of your app are expecting this. We'll be adjusting this once we find a better mechanism for doing so.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Going forward you can prevent a lot of memory issues by following best-practices in Node. Removing events when done, <code>null</code>-ing old references and cleaning up long arrays are great ways of ensuring your app is lite on memory. In times of peril these aren't necessarily helpful, however, and you'll need to to snapshot V8 directly and do some comparisons to find where your issue is.</p>
<p>We also thought it'd be interesting to expose these heapdumps we have to you as well, so feel free to <a href="https://docs.browserless.io/bin/heapdumps.tar.gz">download them here and see what you think</a>. This will give you a chance to play around in devtools and get familiar with the process before you need it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This month, US president Donald Trump was asked an offhand question about QAnon. "I've heard these are people that love our country… so I don't know, really anything about it, other than they do supposedly like me," he said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-praises-qanon-followers-as-people-that-love-our-country-11597883634">during a press briefing</a>. "If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it."&nbsp;<br></p><p>It may seem like an innocuous remark, but it's hard to imagine it was genuine. QAnon is the purveyor of one of the wildest and most pervasive conspiracy theories running through American politics. Based on the cryptic ravings of an anonymous imageboard user named "Q," the theory's adherents believe that Donald Trump is working to ferret out a global satanic pedophilic sex ring secretly supported by elements of the Democratic Party and the "deep state" within the U.S. government.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The group is now holding rallies in numerous cities, ostensibly to combat child sex trafficking. At least one open QAnon believer, Marjorie Taylor Greene, has won a Republican primary in Georgia to run for the House of Representatives. Trump, of course, tweeted his support: "Marjorie is strong on everything and never gives up - a real WINNER!"<br></p><p>QAnon may sound like&nbsp; something that could only have birthed in the darker corners of the internet. But QAnon predates president Donald Trump and even the internet itself;&nbsp; It’s just the latest iteration of a moral panic that swept the highest levels of Western society only a generation ago. One&nbsp; of the most polarizing and divisive social movements in modern history; it destroyed families, turned communities against one another, and sent numerous innocent men and women to prison.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And it all started in Victoria, BC.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a643a027884838fbbb5f5_Michelle.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Michelle Proby, in this image from the 1980 book Michelle Remembers, recalling "repressed" memories of Satanic abuse while under hypnosis. </figcaption></figure><p>It was known as the Satanic Panic; a conspiracy theory that convinced millions of well meaning and rational people that a secret cabal of Satanists had infiltrated the highest echelons of society in order to sexually molest children. The Satanists were accused of sacrificing animals and using women as "breeders" to create an endless supply of dead babies for use in their gory, bloody-fuelled rituals and orgies. <br></p><p>It destroyed lives and ripped apart families. Reports of ritualistic child abuse were reported across the English speaking-world. Almost all of them were eventually found to have been partially, or wholly fabricated, but not before dozens of innocent people were falsely accused, and sentenced to years and even decades in prison.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Born of a genuine historical injustice — society's neglect of childhood sexual abuse — this was a panic that saw some of the world’s smartest minds taken in by accusations, that, at their root, were as preposterous as any raised during medieval European witch hunts. It&nbsp; was legitimized by a professional class, captivated law enforcement and proved itself a lucrative grift for fraudsters and attention seekers. Worse, as the conspiracy grew under its own weight and influence, the hysteria inspired real and horrific crimes — usually by disturbed teenagers who claimed they were sacrificing humans to Satan.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is a case study of how badly off the rails we can go when we allow our best intentions and passions to overwhelm us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a53aa6f49f67c5ee88823_1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The Fort Royal Medical Centre, located just across the street from Royal Jubilee Hospital, where Lawrence Pazder used to have his office and where he first met Michelle Proby (Alex Abraham). </figcaption></figure><p>The story begins in 1980, with the publication of a book called Michelle Remembers. It detailed the fantastic claims of Michelle Proby, who recounted several months of gory and sadistic ritualistic abuse at the hands of a cabal of Satanists when she was a child in 1950s Victoria. The memories, she alleged, were repressed for decades, until she sought help from psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder. Under a state of hypnosis, Proby began to uncover a horrifying tale of murder, torture, abduction, and molestation. She claimed to have been taken from her willing family and groomed to take part in a ritual to call the devil — one in which she witnessed the murder of children, was forced to eat human remains, covered in dead baby parts, and locked in a cage with snakes. <br></p><p>An explosive bestseller. Michelle Remembers would become the folkloric template for countless other claims of Satanic Ritual Abuse ostensibly uncovered during therapy during the 80s and 90s.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On its face, the book seems too implausible to take seriously. But neither Michelle Proby nor Lawrence Pazder gave anyone the impression of being loony, hysterical, or liars. Proby was a married woman living an ordinary life in Victoria. Measured and even-tempered, with close cropped curly dark hair and a soft-spoken, feminine lilt to her speech.<br></p><p>Pazder, her psychiatrist, was by all accounts a brilliant family man, a respected professional psychologist and a devout Catholic.<br></p><p>In 1973, Proby began to visit Pazder to seek treatment for depression. After four years of regular therapy sessions, the pair had worked through Proby's ordinary childhood issues and, it was clear, that their sessions were coming to a natural close. Then, in 1976,&nbsp; Proby suffered a miscarriage and began to experience horrible nightmares. Pazder was called in to help.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had a bad dream last week," she said in one of these first sessions, as described in Michelle Remembers.<br></p><p>"A bad dream?" replied Pazder.&nbsp;<br></p><p>"Yes … a very bad dream,” she said before describing a terrifying dream about scratching an itch on her hand only to have the skin rupture with spiders. “Little spiders, just pouring out of the skin on my hand. It was just --I can't even tell you how it was.”<br></p><p>From there, the sessions began to delve into increasingly bizarre territory. Proby would slip into a kind of hypnotic trance, in which she began to recount long-forgotten events in the childlike voice of her five-year-old self.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a537298ddd30d653f4410_4.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>2078 Newton Street, the childhood home of Michelle Proby, where she alleged the basement was frequently used for Satanic rituals involving snakes and body parts from stillborn babies (Alex Abraham). </figcaption></figure><p>Over the following 14 months, the pair recorded 600 hours of testimony in this state. It was this work that would become the basis of Michelle Remembers. Funded by a $100,000 advance in 1980 dollars, it would earn another $242,000 in paperback rights and royalties — worth more than $1 million in 2020 currency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At first, the events Proby remembered were merely horrific. She began to remember some kind of orgiastic party at a home in the Victoria neighbourhood where guests clubbed a woman to death She remembered an evil man named Malachai, who packed a car with the dead woman's body and then faked an accident on the Malahat highway in order to cover up the murder. She then recalled being forced to eat the dead victim's ashes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As the sessions wore on, the remembering grew more dramatic, detailed and overtly paranormal. While she was at first merely an unwilling participant in Satanic rituals, Proby claimed she was eventually kidnapped by a group that the pair would come to identify as a Victoria-based Satanic cult.<br></p><p>She described rituals performed at night at the city’s historic Ross Bay Cemetery; being placed in an opened grave while a crying cat mewled and a woman dressed in a dark robe chanted above her. She remembered a bizarre ritual of rebirth in a nearby mausoleum, her tormentors hissing and dancing like cats while one of them licked her.<br></p><p>Each session with Pazder built on the horror of the one before, eventually becoming so nightmarish that the therapist brought in priests to offer blessings and benedictions to protect Proby from the evil of her own memory.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Eventually, Proby said that she was saved by the miraculous intervention of Jesus and the Virgin Mary — who appeared to her in the midst of a Satanic ritual.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taken together, the book's claims seem so extraordinary — and its evidence so thin — that it becomes difficult to imagine anyone believing Proby's utterances to be literally true.&nbsp;</p><p>And indeed, Michelle Remembers’ central claims can all be debunked with even cursory investigation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There is no evidence of a fatal car crash on the Malahat highway in the time period that the book covers. The Ross Bay Cemetery mausoleum pictured in the book was too tiny to accommodate several people and a Satanic ritual.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a540a9559045712412701_2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The mausoleum of BC&nbsp;politician Harry Helmcken. The tiny structure was identified in Michelle Remembers as having hosted a large and elaborate Satanic gathering (Alex Abraham). </figcaption></figure><p>Proby's two siblings <a href="https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1980/10/27/things-that-go-bump-in-victoria#!&amp;pid=32">did not corroborate any of her claims</a>. One sibling contacted by The Capital said only that she did not want to talk about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>There's no evidence that Proby suffered a prolonged absence from school during the events described. Besides a dentist's letter confirming a bashed tooth, and a photo of a skin rash, she wasn’t found to have any physical scars of the intensive abuse she had claimed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Most heartbreaking of all, Proby's estranged father told Britain’s The Mail on Sunday that the claims were entirely false and that Proby had grotesquely misrepresented her late mother.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was the worst pack of lies a little girl could ever make up. The book took me four months to read, and I cried all the time. I kept saying to myself: ’Dear God, how could anyone do this to their dead mother?’" Jack Proby told reporters in 1990.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In normal circumstances, such off-the-wall claims might have generated little interest. But Pazder was a difficult man to dismiss. He was a respected psychologist with impeccable credentials; degrees from the Universities of Alberta School of Medicine, the University of Liverpool, and McGill, in addition to being a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, a staff member at local hospitals. Pazder was also deeply religious, and it was likely no coincidence that Proby's recollections came to starkly confirm his own faith.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When Michelle Remembers hit bookshelves, Proby’s account even had …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Even before the pandemic, there were a few companies choosing to work shorter weeks. In Japan, Microsoft gave it a try in later part of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> and found that doing so increased productivity, reduced stress, and lessened employee burnout. It also had the added benefit of lowering operating costs for that month.</p><p>With COVID-19, average work environments have become even more stressful. Places like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/24/will-coronavirus-pandemic-open-door-four-day-workweek/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a> are acknowledging that there is no "one size fits all" solution to helping companies recover or thrive through the global pandemic.</p><p>What would happen if your company decided to run fewer days per week? Would you discover the same benefits as other companies? To answer this question for yourself, you will have to test the theory in your own company. However, to help you, we have looked to find out how other companies are dealing with COVID-19 and what they have gained from switching to a <a href="https://30hourjobs.com/4-day-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-day work week</a>.</p><h2 id="buffer">Buffer</h2><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/4-day-workweek-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a> became a company that chose to experiment for a single month. Their goal was to reduce the stress that employees and teammates were dealing with because of the global crisis. In June, the company decided to continue their May experiment to last the rest of 2020.</p><p>Why the change from "experiment" to full-time? The answer to this is in the feedback provided by their teammates. It seems unanimous that everyone experienced lower stress levels, increased work happiness, and less burnout. Employees worked more efficiently and effectively in their four days because of how relaxed they felt.</p><p>Although it is only something they are trying for the rest of the year, there is hope that it will continue to prove such an undeniable success.</p><h2 id="elephant-ventures">Elephant Ventures</h2><p><a href="https://www.elephantventures.com/4-day-work-week-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephant Ventures</a> has been doing 4-day work weeks in the Philippines for the past five years. They have noticed that across the board there is an increase in productivity because workers feel it balances out the work-life scenarios that we all have to face in the workforce.</p><p>In early June, the company closed its doors on their brick and mortar offices in the US. At the time, there was reasonable certainty that the doors would remain closed. However, in August, they decided that this was not what they truly wanted and began trying to come up with a way to meet the needs of clients in the "post Covid-19" world and take tips from their Philippines offices.</p><p>It is a little too soon to tell whether it is an absolute success or not. This does not mean that there isn't a hope that clients and employees will all be happy working this shorter workweek.</p><h2 id="shopify">Shopify</h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/remote-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify's</a> employees have embraced the remote/in-office way of working for years. However, in March 2020, they closed the door and went fully remote in an effort to "flatten the curve". The fact that they are working in a digital space by default, has made the transition much easier for them than traditional brick and mortar businesses. They already understand that eliminating bad work habits and strengthening healthier ones is beneficial to everyone.</p><p>In June, Shopify once again changed things up and announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/postcarl/status/1272676581165727746" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> that they would reserve Friday as the day for R&amp;R. Their goal at the time was to enjoy the shorter work week through August. It remains to be seen whether it is extended or not.</p><h2 id="shake-shack">Shake Shack</h2><p>For more than a year, Shake Shack has been <a href="https://www.wabe.org/enjoy-the-extra-day-off-more-bosses-give-4-day-workweek-a-try/" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing</a> the theory of shorter work weeks makes for happier employees. It began with a test run in Las Vegas to give managers an extra day off from work each week, while providing them with the typical 40-hour work week benefits. This means the same pay for fewer hours. With the success of it, the gradually spread out the "testing phase" to include more locations.</p><p>Their findings over the last year, is that employees, especially moms, appreciate working a shorter week because it gives them an extra day to spend with their families. This makes them feel better about being at work, because they do not miss out on taking kids to school, running errands on their day off, and more.</p><p>As the pandemic took hold of the US and all other areas of the globe, <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shake Shack</a> did what it could to care for its employees. They still strive to do what they can for the communities that they are a part of.</p><h2 id="radioactive-public-relations">Radioactive Public Relations</h2><p>In June 2019, <a href="https://www.radioactivepr.com/agency-impact-1-year-4-day-pay-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radioactive Public Relations</a> reached their one-year benchmark for working shorter work weeks. They were one of the first companies in the UK to give shorter weeks a try and quickly decided to extend their "test" phase.</p><p>Why was the test phase extended? The answer to this is simple. Employees were taking fewer sick days, recruitment was on the rise, business was growing, and employees were happier across the board. The employee happiness reasoning has ranged from enjoying the time with their families to doing things that they wouldn't be able to do if they worked a traditional work week.</p><h2 id="perpetual-guardian">Perpetual Guardian</h2><p>This New Zealand-based company was one of the first to jump on board with shorter work weeks. Andrew Barnes, founder of <a href="https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/the-four-day-week-is-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perpetual Guardian</a>, began testing the water with it in 2018. Since then, they have discovered that it encourages employees to work harder while encouraging staff members to organize their time more efficiently while at work.</p><p>Overall, it has lowered the stress level of all who work within the company by allowing them to have more of a life outside the office. Employees can now use their time to take up hobbies, spend time with loved ones, return to school for extra studies, and much more.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about balancing your work/life schedule or want to know more about transitioning to a shorter work week, we are here for you. You can contact us, join our newsletter, and more. Our goal at <a href="https://jobs.30hourjobs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 Hour Jobs</a> is to ensure everyone works the way they want to work.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-romano-517179145/">Federico Romano</a></p>



<p>In recent days&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>, founded by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Elon Musk</a>, presented its&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w">advances and possible applications</a>&nbsp;of the controversial brain chip that with thousands of high-tech electrodes will be able to (in the not so distant future) increase our cognitive abilities, cure neurological diseases of great morbidity and merge us with artificial intelligence in a concept that until recently was just science fiction, the symbiosis between humans and computers.</p>



<p>From the presentation, opinions of all kinds arose that show how much the great technological advances make us reconsider our worldview, and the big question: where are we heading with this Neurotechnological revolution that is here to stay and will have a great leap towards the mass public in 2021.</p>



<p>The expectations are enormous, the essence of the human being and its entire evolutionary history focuses on its brain capacity. While Neuralink’s team of experts led by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/max_hodak">Max Hodak</a>&nbsp;is advancing by leaps and bounds, there is a great chasm of experimentation, validation and understanding of how neurons encode information before being able to load data directly into our brain through intracranial implants.This is mentioned by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/tomoxl?lang=en">Thomas Oaxley</a>, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.synchronmed.com/">Synchron</a>, an Australian company that is also developing a system to insert brain probes. Oaxley says effective results should not be expected soon, as the technology is not advanced enough to achieve this. However, he believes that because Musk is willing to invest large amounts of money in his company, it will be “exciting to see what he will develop.” And of course, it will be, the futuristic tech mogul seems to take things seriously.</p>

<p>Is it possible that Neurotechnology enhances our capabilities even before the arrival of Neuralink in the future? The answer is yes, and it is already among us:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">non-invasive EEG</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to the remarkable amount of comments that even behind memes showed concern about implanting something inside the brain, there was also several posts about non-invasive EEG (electroencephalography), we talk about portable EEGs that are gaining more popularity every day in the market through headbands, headphones or tattooEEG.</p>



<p>Neuralink is a promising Neurotechnology with a great positive impact on society, but it seems that we are not ready for this yet, it will take time, perhaps more than 10 years to achieve massive consent to place intracranial chips. Meanwhile, the entire society is left with the desire to enhance brain capabilities with artificial intelligence and this is exactly where portable EEGs come into play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this time, companies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://choosemuse.com/">Interaxon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emotiv.com/">Emotiv</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brainco.tech/">BrainCo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://naxonlabs.com/">Naxon Labs</a>&nbsp;are showing that society is ready to use headbands and wearables that measure our brain activity, enhance cognition and help fight mental and neurological disorders.</p>



<p>Connected only with bluetooth, without implanting chips and with a horizon full of possibilities that range from improving the ability to study or work, detecting when a driver is falling asleep, detecting emotions or accelerating the treatment of many mental and neurological problems on a scale never seen before before.<a href="https://choosemuse.com/">Interaxon</a>&nbsp;for example, has created&nbsp;brainwave-controlled computing technology and applications that converts brainwaves into digital signals. They have an app that can be used with their hardware to train in mindfulness and meditation that can help you calm you down and reduce stress.</p>

<p><a href="https://naxonlabs.com/">Naxon Labs</a>&nbsp;on the other hand, provides software and data platforms that work with Interaxon’s&nbsp;<a href="https://naxonlabs.com/get_headband">Muse headset</a>&nbsp;to offer an accessible, simple and low-cost way to record brain activity and mental states of the person and work with this data to meet the needs of academic centers, clinics and professionals.

At the same time, the company is working on&nbsp;<a href="https://naxonlabs.com/products/emotions">Emotions</a>, a platform for emotion recognition which promise to detect states like anxiety, relaxation, concentration, joy, anger or sadness in real time. The system can be used by mental health professionals to improve patient records for diagnosis and treatment, enable monitoring of patient progress, remote monitoring and therapy, improve the implementation of techniques for regulating mental disorders, and also allowing applications in various specific disorders such as ADHD.</p>

<p>In this way and as a collateral effect, Neuralink opens the door to curiosity about portable EEGs and sows a path towards the future with a society that will no longer be shocked by moving objects with a simple thought.</p>

          <h2>Eliminating Task Processing Outages by Replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka Without Downtime</h2>

          <p><span>Scaling backend infrastructure to handle hyper-growth is one of the many exciting challenges of working at DoorDash. In mid 2019, we faced significant scaling challenges and frequent outages involving </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery_(software)"><span>Celery</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"><span>RabbitMQ</span></a><span>, two technologies powering the system that handles the asynchronous work enabling critical functionalities of our platform, including order checkout and Dasher assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We quickly solved this problem with a simple, </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"><span>Apache Kafka</span></a><span>-based asynchronous task processing system that stopped our outages while we continued to iterate on a robust solution. Our initial version implemented the smallest set of features needed to accommodate a large portion of existing Celery tasks. Once in production, we continued to add support for more Celery features while addressing novel problems that arose when using Kafka. </span></p>
<h2><span>The problems we faced using Celery and RabbitMQ</span></h2>
<p><span>RabbitMQ and Celery were mission critical pieces of our infrastructure that powered over 900 different asynchronous tasks at DoorDash, including order checkout, merchant order transmission, and Dasher location processing. The problem DoorDash faced was that RabbitMQ was frequently going down due to excessive load. If task processing went down, DoorDash effectively went down and orders could not be completed, resulting in revenue loss for our merchants and Dashers, and a poor experience for our consumers. We faced issues on the following fronts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability:</b><span> Outages caused by demand reduced availability.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b><span> RabbitMQ could not scale with the growth of our business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Observability:</b><span> RabbitMQ offered limited metrics and Celery workers were opaque.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Operational efficiency:</b><span> Restarting these components was a time-consuming, manual process.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Why our asynchronous task processing system wasn’t highly available</span></h3>
<p><span>This biggest problem we faced were outages, and they often came when demand was at its peak. RabbitMQ would go down due to load, </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#high-connection-churn"><span>excessive connection churn</span></a><span>, and other reasons. Orders would be halted, and we’d have to restart our system or sometimes even bring up an entirely new broker and manually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"><span>failover</span></a><span> in order to recover from the outage.</span></p>
<p><span>On diving deeper into the availability issues, we found the following sub-issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Celery allows users to schedule tasks in the future with a countdown or ETA. Our heavy use of&nbsp; these countdowns resulted in noticeable load increases on the broker. Some of our outages were directly related to an increase in tasks with countdowns. We ultimately decided to restrict the use of countdowns in favor of another system we had in place for scheduling work in the future.</span></li>
<li><span>Sudden bursts of traffic would leave RabbitMQ in a degraded state where task consumption was significantly lower than expected. In our experience, this could only be resolved with a RabbitMQ bounce. RabbitMQ has a concept of Flow Control where it will reduce the speed of connections which are publishing too quickly so that queues can keep up. Flow Control was often, but not always, involved in these availability degradations. When Flow Control kicks in, the publishers effectively see it as network latency. Network latency reduces our response times; if latency increases during peak traffic, significant slowdowns can result that cascade as requests pile up upstream.</span></li>
<li><span>Our python </span><a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span>uWSGI</span></a><span> web workers had a feature called harakiri that was enabled to kill any processes that exceeded a timeout. During outages or slowdowns, harakiri resulted in a connection churn to the RabbitMQ brokers as processes were repeatedly killed and restarted. With thousands of web workers running at any given time, any slowness that triggered harakiri would in turn contribute even more to slowness by adding extra load to RabbitMQ.</span></li>
<li><span>In production we experienced several cases where task processing in the Celery consumers&nbsp; stopped, even in the absence of significant load. Our investigation efforts did not yield evidence of any resource constraints that would’ve halted processing, and the workers resumed processing once they were bounced. This problem was never root caused, though we suspect an issue in the Celery workers themselves and not RabbitMQ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, all of these availability issues were unacceptable for us as high reliability is one of our highest priorities. Since these outages were costing us a lot in terms of missed orders and credibility we needed a solution that would address these problems as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why our legacy solution did not scale&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The next biggest problem was scale. DoorDash is growing fast and we were quickly reaching the limits of our existing solution. We needed to find something that would keep up with our continued growth since our legacy solution had the following problems:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Hitting the vertical scaling limit</strong></p>
<p><span>We were using the largest available single-node RabbitMQ solution that was available to us. There was no path to scale vertically any further and we were already starting to push that node to its limits.</span></p>
<p><strong>The High Availability mode limited our capacity&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Due to replication, the primary-secondary High Availability (HA) mode reduced throughput compared to the single node option, leaving us with even less headroom than just the single node solution. We could not afford to trade throughput for availability.</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the primary-secondary HA mode did not, in practice, reduce the severity of our outages. Failovers took more than 20&nbsp; minutes&nbsp; to complete and would often get stuck requiring manual intervention. Messages were often lost in the process as well.</span></p>
<p><span>We were quickly running out of headroom as DoorDash continued to grow and push our task processing to its limits. We needed a solution that could scale horizontally as our processing needs grew.</span></p>
<h3><span>How Celery and RabbitMQ offered limited observability</span></h3>
<p><span>Knowing what’s going on in any system is fundamental to ensuring its availability, scalability, and operational integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we navigated the issues outlined above, we noticed that :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We were limited to a small set of RabbitMQ metrics available to us.</span></li>
<li><span>We had limited visibility into the Celery workers themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We needed to be able to see real-time metrics of every aspect of our system which meant the observability limitations needed to be addressed as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The operational efficiency challenges</span></h3>
<p><span>We also faced several issues with operating RabbitMQ:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We often had to failover our RabbitMQ node to a new one to resolve the persistent degradation we observed. This operation was manual and time consuming for the engineers involved and often had to be done late at night, outside of peak times.</span></li>
<li><span>There were no in-house Celery or RabbitMQ experts at DoorDash who we could lean on to help devise a scaling strategy for this technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Engineering time spent operating and maintaining RabbitMQ was not sustainable. We needed something that better met our current and future needs.</span></p>
<h2><span>Potential solutions to our problems with Celery and RabbitMQ&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>With the problems outlined above, we considered the following solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Celery broker from RabbitMQ to Redis or Kafka. </b>This would allow us to continue using Celery, with a different and potentially more reliable backing datastore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Add multi-broker support to our </b><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a><b> app so consumers could publish to N different brokers based on whatever logic we wanted. </b>Task processing will get sharded across multiple brokers, so each broker will experience a fraction of the initial load.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade to newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ. </b>Newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ were expected to fix reliability issues, buying us time as we were already extracting components from our Django monolith in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Migrate to a custom solution backed by Kafka. </b>This solution takes more effort than the other options we listed, but also has more potential to solve every problem we were having with the legacy solution.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Each option has its pros and cons:</span></p>

They were influenced by ideas coming out of the Enlightenment, specifically Adam Smith, Locke, Rousseau, and the conception of humans resorting to “the state of nature” and acting in bad-faith with one another.</p> <figure> <blockquote> <p> "fuck the monarchy, let's experiment with a rational government based on contract law and this new capitalism stuff." </p> </blockquote> <figcaption> —The Forefathers™, <cite>The Federalist Papers</cite> </figcaption> </figure> <p>The problem with this type of Hobbesian thinking is “man will resort to kill or be killed in the ‘state of nature’” and therefore the State must enforce contacts to ensure civility and protect the rights of property.</p> <p>My thinking is more aligned to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/business/media/how-zeynep-tufekci-keeps-getting-the-big-things-right.html">Zeynep Tufecki</a></p> <blockquote> <p>“We think of society as this Hobbesian thing, as opposed to the reality where most people are very friendly, most people are prone to solidarity.” <cite><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/business/media/how-zeynep-tufekci-keeps-getting-the-big-things-right.html">How Zeynep Tufekci Keeps Getting the Gig-things Right</a> </cite></p> </blockquote> <p>In disasters and daily life, people want to help each other, and feel as part of something greater than themselves. The atomization of the individual, a result of capitalism, continually undermines this fundamental aspect of the human experience.</p> <p>So when we’ve built our government on Hobbes as our fundamental philosophical ideology, we’ve ended up institutionalizing the idea that civil society is “every man for himself” rather than “every man for each other” and those institutions become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, we’ve expanded on the US experiment in capitalism by privileging corporations with more rights and freedoms than humans, but without the social or moral responsibilities. That can only end badly when their only motive is profit. Then we’ve built this enormous apparatus of violence in the US military, the national guard, a decentralized police force, and a word salad of agencies like the NSA, CIA, FBI, CBP, TSA, ATF, hell even the USPS has an armed force. All these agencies assume the average person is acting in bad-faith, and yet we wonder why these armed agents are killing people by the thousands and without accountability and most often with total immunity.</p> <p>This is all to say, the experiment in democratic Hobbesian capitalism should be cancelled. Its core assumption are all wrong: it assumed infinite resources on a finite planet which is wrong, it assumed the worst of people which is wrong, It absolved corporations of any ethics and granted them freedom and rights—which is wrong.</p> <p>The experiment is no longer producing the outcomes for which it once promised—based on the idea of the social contract established by Rousseau, which provides for social reciprocity: we chose the laws under which we live. This is less and less the case. We’re increasingly seeing wealth for the few and social precarity for the many, under a system of governance that responds to corporations before it responds to people.</p> <p>It’s time to try a new experiment in resource allocation and governance that is egalitarian, sustainable, and provides a vision where all inhabitants of this planet act in good faith towards a project for multiple worlds, and many positive futures. Other <em>worlds</em> are possible.</p> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered: “What if clicking on a hyperlink could transport me — not just the screen in front of me — to a new location?”</p><p>That’s what the founders of Uber wondered. So, they transformed an ordinary link into a request for a ride.</p><p>This is called “hacking hypertext”.</p><p>Imagine, a link—a button, a menu, a search result—being able to accomplish something in the real world with a single click.</p><p>Google is a great example of this. They hacked hypertext in two ways: 1) They realized a hyperlink to a page meant that page is more valuable and 2) They gave everyone access to the most valuable links with the click of a Search button.</p><p>Facebook took hyperlinks to the next level by making them represent people and their relationships. Events, messages, profile pages, relationship statuses — all available with a click.</p><p>Who else has hacked hypertext?</p><ul><li>Amazon has 1-Click ordering that makes products show up at your door</li><li>Airbnb lets you rent apartments around the world with a click</li><li>Netflix makes thousands of tv shows and movies accessible with a single click</li></ul><p>These companies transform the good ol’ hyperlink into something incredibly powerful. </p><p>For most of us, though, links are still just plain, boring links.</p><p>As an ordinary person on the internet, I can’t create a link out of thin air that will show a list of my upcoming events or let someone rent my apartment — I rely on Facebook and Airbnb to create these kinds of links. </p><p>So, the question is: <em>why isn’t hypertext more powerful by default?</em></p><p>The answer is: it’s wildly expensive to transform an ordinary hyperlink into something more.</p><p>Big companies like Google and Facebook spend billions of dollars a year building the infrastructure and hiring the talent necessary to support their hypertext hacks.</p><p>Usually, the most an ordinary citizen of the internet can do is use a hyperlink to link to their social media profile or personal website.</p><p>But... what if someone decided to democratize the incredible power these big companies have to hack hypertext?</p><p>What if anyone could hack hypertext?</p><p>More and more companies are buying into the “Low-Code” movement. Companies like Stripe, Webflow, and Shopify are making it easier to create online businesses. And companies like Airtable, Bubble, and Glide are making it possible for ordinary people to build powerful experiences using a set of hypertext hacks they invented.</p><p>But the foundation is still lacking. Hypertext itself hasn’t changed that much in the past three decades. It’s still, by default, pretty weak. It’s meant to create links between pages, not links to real-world actions.</p><p>I believe there’s a stage after “Low-Code”, a kind of hypertext 2.0. Maybe it comes with virtual reality, or cryptocurrency — or maybe it’s born when someone creates a new type of web browser. I don’t know. But, when it comes, it’s going to let anyone have the power to reshape the real world with a good ol’ hyperlink.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>How does QuestDB get the kind of performance it does, and how are we continuing
to squeeze another 50-60% out of it? We are constantly learning more about the
fundamental concepts of memory performance, and this is one example of how what
we at first thought would be <em>worse</em> for performance ended up bringing us a
rather substantial boost in overall memory performance.</p><p>We will walk you through how some of our initial thoughts on storage and
memory-mapping evolved to bring us better performance overall.</p><p>If you like QuestDB, please do give us a star on
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p><h2>How the performance improvements started</h2><p>QuestDB started out with a single-threaded approach to queries and such. But one
obvious way to improve performance in a Java application like this is to
parallelize as much as you can by using multiple threads of execution.</p><p>I've written multi-threaded applications, and they are not easy to do. It's hard
to coordinate the work between multiple threads, and to make sure that there are
no race conditions, collisions, etc.</p><h2>Storage performance</h2><p>So first it's important to understand that QuestDB stores it's data in columnar
format. We store each column of data in a file. So for every column of data,
there is a file.</p><p>We then split those columns up into data frames that are independent and can be
computed completely independently of each other.</p><p>The problem we encountered with this framing scheme was that it was impossible
to frame variable length data. Data spilled out of the frame, making it
difficult to manage.</p><p>You see, we store fixed length fields with fixed length values, such that
aligning frames to 8 bytes would ensure that all our fixed length data does not
straddle frames. Hence all the columns are the same frame width. But strings and
blobs can't be forced into 8 bytes without making them useless.</p><p>So we could extract extreme performance out of all the fixed-length values, but
these variable-length values dragged the performance back down.</p><p>Which brings us to pages and how data is referenced in memory.</p><h2>Pages of data</h2><p>QuestDB uses memory-mapped pages to reference data in order to make it really
fast. If you're dividing up your data into pages, and all data has a fixed
length, then it's relatively easy to ensure that you don't have data that spans
multiple pages. You just break pages at multiples of 8-bytes and everything will
fit within page boundaries.</p><p>When you add variable-length data, suddenly you cannot ensure that everything
will line up along page boundaries and you will have the very real possibility
-- actually a certainty -- that you may have to jump from one page to another
just to get all the data contained in a frame.</p><p>This, it turns out, is hugely inefficient. If (data is in frame) then (process
that data) else (figure out where the rest of the data is, get that, then
process it all). This kind of if-then-else sprinkled throughout the code is a)
hard to debug and b) leads to lots of branching, which slows down execution.</p><p>In order to prevent variable length data from straddling frames we would need to
have different frame lengths per column. Furthermore, calculating aligned frame
lengths for variable length data is non trivial and requires scanning the entire
data set which would reversing any performance gains from parallelization.</p><h2>One page to rule them all</h2><p>(Yes, I just made a <em>The Highlander</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference</a>)</p><p>What if, in order to get around data being on multiple pages, we simply used
<em>one</em> page for all of the data? Of course my first question was "Don't you at
some point reach a limit on the page size?" but Vlad and Patrick assured me
there is, indeed, no limit on a page size.</p><p>If your page size is bigger than the available memory, the kernel will handle
swapping pages in and out for you as you try to access different parts of the
page. So of course I asked "well then, why didn't you do this from the
beginning?"</p><p>Vlad, in his typically self-deprecating style, just said "We didn't know. We
thought we should keep them to a certain size to keep them from growing out of
control" which, quite frankly, seems like the right answer.</p><p>We'd just resize those smaller pages as needed. But as Vlad explained, if you do
that then you need to copy the data over to the new, resized page and "copying
can take over your life." Databases aren't built to maximize the efficiency of
data copying. They are built to maximize the ability to extract value from data.
Copying data from one page to another isn't extracting value.</p><p>So they tried just allocating a new page, and jumping from one page to the next
as needed to find the required data. This cut down on the copying of data, but
it lead to the problems outlined in the previous section. You never knew which
page your data was going to be on, and jumping from one page to another was
hugely inefficient.</p><p>So they tried having just the one page. One massive page (that you can grow as
needed, without copying data around). Vlad, again in his style, said the
performance turned out to be "not bad" with this approach. And by "not bad" he
of course meant about a 60% performance improvement.</p><p>When you get into using one single page, of course the total available address
space comes into play. But since QuestDB only runs on 64-bit architectures, we
have 2^64 address space, which is more than enough.</p><p>This is where Patrick jumped in to explain that when you have an area of memory
mapped from a file, when the file grows you remap the new size into memory. The
operating system does not need to copy anything; the virtual memory model allows
the OS to just remap the already mapped pages into the newly mapped memory
region. In many cases, the OS may have already reserved the entire address space
for you so your new mapping is in the same region as the old, just bigger.</p><h2>Kernels are smart</h2><p>The kernel allocated a full sized address space for your file when you requested
the memory-mapped file. And apparently this is true across Linux, macOS and
Windows. So from that point on, there's really no further copying that needs to
happen.</p><p>Furthermore, the kernel is going to handle paging parts of that file in and out
of memory as needed. Now, I'm old-school Unix, and page-swapping which lead to
thrashing was always something we worried about back in the olden days. So I
asked about it. According to Patrick, this could only happen really if you have
a massive file that you are reading basically randomly at high speed. Other than
that, the kernel will handle reading ahead and pre-loading pages as needed in
order to be as efficient as possible.</p><p>Kernels, it turns out, are smart. In fact, kernels are basically smarter than
you or I will ever hope to be. They've been developed across decades to be
hugely efficient at doing these things. It's what they do. The kernel will
memory map the file into the file cache and even if it needs to move stuff
around, it can move the logical address and it's still the same underlying
physical memory pages.</p><p>If you think that you can take over caching the data from the OS and do a better
job of managing the memory space, and the allocation and re-allocation of the
memory, you're wrong. Again, this is what the Kernel does, and at some level,
even if you try to take this job away from the kernel, it is <em>still</em> doing some
amount of it anyway. So your attempts to take this memory management and
allocation away from the kernel has done little more than just add another layer
on top of what the kernel is doing anyway. Another layer on top of something is
basically never more efficient than the original thing.</p><p>When you read an offset into a file, you send a buffer to read into, the address
to start reading at, and the offset into the file. Now, the kernel is going to
cache all of that for you as you do it, because that's the kernel's job, really.
But many database developers then take that, and cache it themselves, with their
own caching scheme.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>When I asked Vlad about this, and how it relates to query speed, he was quite
explicit in saying that thinking you (a database developer) can beat the kernel
is pure folly. Postgres tries this and, according to Vlad, an aggregation over a
large (really large!) dataset can take 5 <em>minutes</em>, whereas the same aggregation
on QuestDB takes only 60ms. Those aren't typos.</p><p>To both Patrick and Vlad (and me, for what that's worth), the idea that we, as
developers, can be better at these operations than the kernel (when really we're
doing them <em>on top of</em> the kernel anyway) is simply ridiculous. If I take an
army of researchers and spend a decade of development, then <em>maybe</em> I can do it
better than the kernel, but during that time guess what? The army of people
working on the kernel will have found further improvements and left me behind
anyway.</p><p>It comes down to letting the kernel do its job, and us doing ours. And our job
is to exploit the kernel for every ounce of performance we can get out of it
without trying to do it's job for it.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>When it comes to performance claims, we always try to back them up with actual
numbers that can be replicated. You can run these tests yourself, and you can
always go and look at the
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>
for these tests to see how they are implemented.</p><p>We think these numbers speak for themselves.</p><p>These first results are for the primitives and represent 10,000 reads/writes:</p><h3>32-bit Read</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryReadBenchmark.testIntContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>4601.940</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryReadBenchmark.testIntLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>7064.822</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>32-Bit Write</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryBenchmark.testPutIntContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>5270.264</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryBenchmark.testPutIntLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>5692.148</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>64-bit Read</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongReadBenchmark.testLongContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>4088.338</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongReadBenchmark.testLongLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>5022.875</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>64-bit Write</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongWriteBenchmark.testPutLongContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>4413.181</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongWriteBenchmark.testPutLongLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>6976.593</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><p>And here are the results for strings, which represent 100 …</p></section></div>

<![CDATA[You Don't Need Staging Environments]]>

September 4, 2020 | https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>
  Theoretically, staging environments sound nice. Why wouldn’t you want
  something that previews what the code will look like before production? The
  issue is what happens in practice.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a big ask. To show how much of a big ask it is let’s walk through an
  example. Say that there’s a developer named Bob. Bob works in a 7 person
  startup that is building a SaaS tool. Their stack has three parts: a static
  HTML frontend, a node backend, and a Postgres server.
</p>
<p>
  This week, one of Bob’s goals is to set up a staging environment to get those
  sweet sweet previews everyone’s been talking about. It looks simple enough,
  they’re already using serverless to deploy their frontend so the job is
  reduced down to hooking up some pipeline to deploy a version of the frontend
  for each new commit on a separate subdomain.
</p>
<h4>Issue 1: Version Incompatibilities With The Backend</h4>
<p>
  That works and he’s happy. Two weeks later though, there are some issues. The
  team is working on a major feature that’s been in development for the past few
  days on a separate branch. It includes both changes to the frontend and a new
  endpoint on the backend. So the staging environment crashes because it tries
  to talk to the backend while the backend doesn’t have the endpoint. The
  solution? Give the staging environment its backend. Bob wrangles the pipeline
  a bit to deploy a backend and a frontend for each change. After a few days of
  work, it’s done and he’s happy.
</p>
<h4>Issue 2: Handing Database Schema Changes</h4>
<p>
  Three weeks later, there's an issue again. Now the team is working on a
  feature that includes a schema change on the database. They can’t use the
  staging environment because the server crashes due to incompatibility with the
  database. The solution seems clear. Bring the database into the staging
  environment. He wrangles the pipeline to spin up a new DB for each commit and
  run migration scripts on startup every time. Now the staging environment is a
  complete miniature copy of what’s happening in production. There shouldn’t be
  any more issues going forward. Right?
</p>
<h4>Issue 3: Maintaining The Codebase For Different Target Environments</h4>
<p>
  Wrong. Bob notices something unexpected. The team is using staging
  environments less than before. Turns out it's a hassle to have to create a new
  user account and generate content every time they want to test things on the
  staging environment. They started seeding the staging database on startup, but
  then realized they now have to maintain code to seed the database for each
  table inside it, and that’s a hassle.
</p>
<p>
  <b>As the staging environment grew more complicated, it became less easy to
    work with.</b>
  In the future, the backend might need another service to function like a Redis
  instance or a new microservice. That’s gonna have to go into the staging
  environment too. Maybe Bob should have stopped at just the frontend and kept
  the staging environment hooked up to the production backend.
</p>
<p>
  But then the team risks incompatibility issues when the staging frontend
  expects a different version of the production backend it’s talking to. At
  best, the frontend will throw errors occasionally, at
  <b> worst it will silently leave corrupted data on the database</b>.
</p>
<h4>Staging Isn't Easy</h4>
<p>
  If your team doesn't have the bandwidth or the resources to build a pipeline
  that can spin up entire miniature copies of the production environment,
  <b>staging isn't for you</b>. The biggest draw for staging environments is to
  visually inspect changes to the frontend. The backend parts of the codebase
  can often be more conveniently verified through testing.
</p>
<p>
  For previewing frontends, we built Capsule for developers like Bob’s team. You
  can use the extension to make HTML recordings of the frontend. Just by linking
  to your capsule in the PRs, you'd be able to do the same thing a staging
  environment can do with none of the work of maintaining a staging environment
  pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Say that I was part of the google calendar team, and wanted to share my local
  changes. I click on the extension, and boom:
</p>

<p>
  I have a shareable link to my changes. No maintance; no deployment pipelines
  needed.
</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

<h3>Learn how to implement an automated machine learning strategy with the goal of finding the optimal stocks for algorithmic trading.</h3>



<hr>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/0*Qin1Uu6TF6EGY9Qe" alt="Image for post" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@stephenleo1982?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Leonardi</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p id="761b">With the increasing popularity of machine learning, many traders are looking for ways in which they can “teach” a computer to trade for them. This process is called algorithmic trading (sometimes called algo-trading).</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Algorithmic trading is a hands off strategy for buying and selling stocks that leverages technical indicators instead of human intuition.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p id="8e73">In order to implement an algorithmic trading strategy though, you have to first narrow down a list of stocks that you want to analyze. This walk-through provides an automated process (using python and logistic regression) for determining the best stocks to algo-trade.</p>



<p id="45b0">I will dive deeper into the logic and code below, but here is a high-level overview of the process:</p>



<ol><li>Import the historical data of every stock using yahoo finance.</li><li>Pull in over 32 technical indicators for each stock using the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</li><li>Perform a logistic regression on each stock using 5, 30, and 60 day observation time periods.</li><li>Interpret the results.</li></ol>

<h2 id="8a50">Collecting Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="b37a">Obtaining historical data on the stocks that we want to observe is a two-step process.</p>



<ol><li>Narrow down a list of stocks that we want to observe.</li><li>Make individual calls to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>&nbsp;in order to import data about each company.</li></ol>



<p id="d925"><strong>Choosing the Stocks We Want to Target</strong></p>



<p id="b1b8">The library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>&nbsp;allows us to compile a list of stock tickers by filtering companies on aspects like market cap or exchange. For this example, I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions).</p>



<p id="b0b7">You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. This is very important. You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<p id="a75a">We also need to remove and create a folder on our local machine to hold historical stock data. Note that before this step runs for the first time, you will need to manually create this folder. This step is important because it will get rid of the data from past iterations and allow the program to start new.</p>



<div><pre data-file="https://gist.github.com/cameronShadmehry/7fd146a70470186482eadefde6dec7ea#file-atlr_gettickers-py" data-lang="Python"><code># List of the stocks we are interested in analyzing. At the time of writing this, it narrows the list of stocks down to 44.
# If you have a list of your own you would like to use just create a new list instead of using this, for example: tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", ...] 
tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)

# Check that the amount of tickers isn't more than 2000
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))

# These two lines remove the Stocks folder and then recreate it in order to remove old stocks. Make sure you have created a Stocks Folder the first time you run this.

<h2 id="c45e">Importing Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="1c9d">We will now obtain the historical price data of each stock in our tickers list by making independent calls to Yahoo Finance. After receiving the data, the program will save each company’s information in a new CSV file that will be located in the folder you created beforehand.</p>

Amount_of_API_Calls = 0

# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2
# seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again.
# Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP. The clause "(Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800)" below will stop the loop from making
# too many calls to the yfinance API.

        Hist_data.to_csv("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Bayesian_Logistic_Regression\\Stocks\\"+stock+".csv")  # Saves the historical data in csv format for further processing later

<h2 id="2687">Importing Technical Indicators</h2>



<p id="a921">In order to run a logistic regression on each stock, we need to substantiate the independent variables. These 32+ technical indicators will act as predictor variables for the dependent variable.</p>



<p id="6e7c">To bring in the technical indicators we make use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</p>



<p id="1d04">You will also notice that we are creating three extra columns. These will act as the value we are trying to predict (dependent variable) with the model. The three variables are 5, 30, and 60 day observations of the closing prices of each stock (1 if it increased and 0 if it did not).</p>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

						<p><em>Der CCC richtet in diesem Jahr erstmalig die Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) statt einer Veranstaltung vor Ort in Leipzig aus.<br>
</em><em>Dafür braucht es Kreativität, Experimentierfreude und tatkräftige Unterstützung.</em></p>
<p>[<a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/#english">English Version below</a>]</p>
<p>Eine Präsenzveranstaltung mit 17.000 Menschen wird in diesem Jahr weder verantwortungsvoll noch legal durchführbar sein.<br>
Aber nach der Durststrecke 2020 haben wir uns ein schönes Jahresende redlich verdient! Deshalb wird es die rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience geben.<br>
Wir wollen so viel wie möglich von Freude, Inhalten, Zusammensein und wunderbarem Wahnsinn transportieren, die einen Chaos Communication Congress ausmachen.</p>
<p>Hackerinnen sind remote-Arbeit und -Zusammenkünfte gewohnt. Umso wichtiger ist das jährliche persönliche Treffen.<br>
Natürlich wird es schwierig, all den Wahnsinn online abzubilden, der den Congress für uns ausmacht.<br>
Doch dann sagte jemand, es wäre unmöglich. Unser Ehrgeiz war geweckt.<br>
Wir wollen sehen, wie sich die geballte Energie und Kreativität der Hackerinnen dieser Herausforderung widmet.</p>
<h2>Was erwartet mich?</h2>
<p>Die rC3 wird eine Vielzahl von <strong>kleinen lokalen Events</strong> in den örtlichen Hackspaces <strong>mit einem gemeinsamen Programm</strong> von gestreamten Talks, Online-Workshops, Kunst, Kultur und verschiedensten Formen des vernetzten Zusammenseins.</p>
<p>In den vergangenen Monaten konnte der Club mit dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digital verteilten Online-Chaos</a> wichtige Erfahrungen sammeln. Für die rC3 gilt es, noch darüber hinauswachsen. Dafür werden alle gebraucht, die mitmachen und mitgestalten wollen.</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mich einbringen?</h2>
<p>Du hattest schon immer großartige Ideen für den Congress – aber dir hat der Platz dafür gefehlt?<br>
Physische Limitierungen schränken dich ohnehin nur unnötig ein?</p>
<p>Willkommen im Internet! Hier können wir bisher für unmöglich gehaltene Dinge entwickeln!<br>
Endlich kann auch dein Wohnzimmer oder euer Hackspace zur Bühne, zum weltweiten Workshop-Space, zur Kunst-Installation werden!</p>
<p>Unser aller Kreativität ist es, die den Congress für alle zum Wunderland macht.<br>
Die vielen Workshops sind es, die jedes Jahr jung und alt für Neues begeistern.<br>
Großartige Vorträge vermitteln jedes Jahr neues Wissen aus Wissenschaft, Technik und Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Was sind Deine Ideen für eine Online-Welt?</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mitgestalten? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In den nächsten Wochen wird es <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">an dieser Stelle</a> einen Call for Participation geben. Die Content-Track-Teams freuen sich schon auf eure kreativen Einreichungen und Format-Ideen!</p>
<p>Bis dahin wollen wir Ideen sammeln, wie wir zusammen die rC3 gestalten wollen.<br>
Was erwarten wir von einer Remote-Veranstaltung?<br>
Welche neuen Formate, Spiele und Easter-Eggs sind möglich?<br>
Was können wir beitragen?<br>
Und welche Fehler sollten die C3-Teams beim Planen vermeiden?</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über jedes Input unter<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>
<h2>Wann ist das nochmal?</h2>
<p>Save the date:<br>
27. – 30. Dezember 2020<br>
Online und im lokalen Hackspace mit deiner bevorzugten Infektionsgemeinschaft</p>
<hr>
<p>[English Version]<a name="english"></a></p>

<p><em>This year, CCC hosts the Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) instead of an on-site event in Leipzig.<br>
This endeavor requires creativity, joy of experimentation and active support.</em></p>
<p>A face-to-face event with 17,000 people will be neither responsible nor legally feasible this year. But after this tedious and painful 2020, we really deserve a nice finale!<br>
This is why the rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience will be held.<br>
As much as virtually possible, we want to convey the joy, content, togetherness and wonderful madness that make up a Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
<p>Hackers are used to remote work and online meetings. This makes our annual face-to-face meetings all the more important. Of course, it will be difficult to re-enact online all the things that make Congress what it is for us.<br>
But then someone said it would be impossible. Our ambition was aroused.<br>
Just like every year, we want to see the concentrated energy and creativity of hackers with dedication.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>rC3 will be a variety of <strong>distributed small local events</strong> in hackspaces <strong>with a joint program </strong>of streamed talks, online workshops, art, culture and various forms of networked togetherness.</p>
<p>In recent months, CCC has gained quite some experience with <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digitally distributed online chaos</a> events.<br>
With rC3, we want to grow even beyond that. For this, we need everyone who wants to participate and help shape rC3.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>You always had great ideas for Congress – but you lacked the space for it?<br>
Common restrictions of the physical world are annoying limitations to your creativity anyway?</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet! Here, we can develop things that have been impossible so far!<br>
Finally, your living room or hackspace can become a stage, a worldwide workshop space, an art installation!</p>
<p>It’s all our creativity that makes the Congress a wonderland for everyone.<br>
It is the many workshops that inspire young and old for new things every year.<br>
Great lectures convey new knowledge from science, technology and society every year.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for an online gathering?</p>
<h2>How can I bring in my ideas? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In the next weeks, there will be a Call for Participation <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">at this site</a>. The content track teams are already looking forward to your creative submissions and format ideas!</p>
<p>Until then, we want to collect ideas on how we want to unfold rC3 together.<br>
What do we expect from a remote event?<br>
What new formats, games and easter-eggs are possible?<br>
What can we contribute?<br>
And what mistakes should the C3 teams avoid while planning?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to any input under<br>

<p>This summer, I am again <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/11/research-assistant.html">working on Rust full-time</a>, and again I will work (amongst other things) on a “memory model” for Rust/MIR.
However, before I can talk about the ideas I have for this year, I have to finally take the time and dispel the myth that “pointers are simple: they are just integers”.
Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.</p>

<p>I also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what <em>is</em> the data that is stored in memory?
It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte?
Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)</p>

<h2 id="pointers-are-complicated">Pointers Are Complicated</h2>

<p>What is the problem with “pointers are just integers”?  Let us consider the following example:<br>
(I am using C++ code here mostly because writing unsafe code is easier in C++ than in Rust, and unsafe code is where these problems really show up. C has all the same issues, as does unsafe Rust.)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>/* some side-effect-free computation */</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It would be beneficial to be able to optimize the final read of <code>y[0]</code> to just return <code>42</code>.
The justification for this optimization is that writing to <code>x_ptr</code>, which points into <code>x</code>, cannot change <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>However, given how low-level a language C++ is, we can actually break this assumption by setting <code>i</code> to <code>y-x</code>.
Since <code>&amp;x[i]</code> is the same as <code>x+i</code>, this means we are actually writing <code>23</code> to <code>&amp;y[0]</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, that does not stop C++ compilers from doing these optimizations.
To allow this, the standard declares our code to have <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/14/undefined-behavior.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, it is not allowed to perform pointer arithmetic (like <code>&amp;x[i]</code> does) that goes <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">beyond either end of the array it started in</a>.
Our program violates this rule: <code>x[i]</code> is outside of <code>x</code>, so this is undefined behavior.
To be clear: Just the <em>computation</em> of <code>x_ptr</code> is already UB, we don’t even get to the part where we want to <em>use</em> this pointer!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But we are not done yet: This rule has a special exception that we can exploit to our advantage.
If the arithmetic ends up computing a pointer <em>just past</em> the end of an allocation, that computation is fine.
(This exception is necessary to permit computing <code>vec.end()</code> for the usual kind of C++98 iterator loop.)</p>

<p>So let us change this example a bit:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>+</span><span>8</span><span>;</span> <span>// one past the end</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>==</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
      <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, imagine that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have been allocated <em>right next to each other</em>, with <code>y</code> having the higher address.
Then <code>x_ptr</code> actually points <em>right at the beginning</em> of <code>y</code>!
The conditional is true and the write happens.
Still, there is no UB due to out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>This seems to break the optimization.
However, the C++ standard has another trick up its sleeve to help compiler writers: It doesn’t actually allow us to <em>use</em> our <code>x_ptr</code> above.
According to what the standard says about <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">addition on pointers</a>, <code>x_ptr</code> points “one past the last element of the array object”.
It does <em>not</em> point at an actual element of another object <em>even if they have the same address</em>. (At least, that is the common interpretation of the standard based on which <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/vxmtej">LLVM optimizes this code</a>.)</p>

<p>The key point here is that just because <code>x_ptr</code> and <code>&amp;y[0]</code> point to the same <em>address</em>, that does not make them <em>the same pointer</em>, i.e., they cannot be used interchangeably:
<code>&amp;y[0]</code> points to the first element of <code>y</code>; <code>x_ptr</code> points past the end of <code>x</code>.
If we replace <code>*x_ptr = 23</code> by <code>*&amp;y[0] = 0</code>, we change the meaning of the program, even though the two pointers have been tested for equality.</p>

<p>This is worth repeating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal and can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this sounds subtle, it is.
In fact, this still causes miscompilations in both <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35229">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65752">GCC</a>.</p>

<p>Also notice that this one-past-the-end rule is not the only part of C/C++ where this effect can be witnessed.
Another example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict"><code>restrict</code></a> keyword in C, which can be used to express that pointers do not alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Calling <code>test()</code> triggers UB because the two accesses in <code>foo</code> must not alias.
Replacing <code>*y</code> by <code>*x</code> in <code>foo</code> changes the meaning of the program such that it no longer has UB.
So, again, even though <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the same address, they cannot be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Pointers are definitely not integers.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-pointer-model">A Simple Pointer Model</h2>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> a pointer?
I don’t know the full answer to this.
In fact, this is an open area of research.</p>

<p>One important point to stress here is that we are just looking for an <em>abstract model</em> of the pointer.
Of course, on the actual machine, pointers are integers.
But the actual machine also does not do the kind of optimizations that modern C++ compilers do, so it can get away with that.
If we wrote the above programs in assembly, there would be no UB, and no optimizations.
C++ and Rust employ a more “high-level” view of memory and pointers, restricting the programmer for the benefit of optimizations.
When formally describing what the programmer may and may not do in these languages, as we have seen, the model of pointers as integers falls apart, so we have to look for something else.
This is another example of using a “virtual machine” that’s different from the real machine for specification purposes, which is an idea <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html">I have blogged about before</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple proposal (in fact, this is the model of pointers used in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00703441/document">CompCert</a> and my <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/08/rustbelt.html">RustBelt work</a>, and it is also how <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">miri</a> implements <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fefe81605d6111faa8dbb3635ab2c51d59de740a/src/librustc/mir/interpret/mod.rs#L121-L124">pointers</a>):
A pointer is a pair of some kind of ID uniquely identifying the <em>allocation</em>, and an <em>offset</em> into the allocation.
If we defined this in Rust, we might write</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>alloc_id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>isize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding/subtracting an integer to/from a pointer just acts on the offset, and can thus never leave the allocation.
Subtracting a pointer from another is only allowed when both point to the same allocation (matching <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#6">C++</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It turns out (and miri shows) that this model can get us very far.
We always remember which allocation a pointer points to, so we can differentiate a pointer “one past the end” of one allocation from a pointer to the beginning of another allocation.
That’s how miri can detect that our second example (with <code>&amp;x[8]</code>) is UB.</p>

<h2 id="the-model-falls-apart">The Model Falls Apart</h2>

<p>In this model, pointers are not integers, but they are at least simple.
However, this simple model starts to fall apart once you consider pointer-integer casts.
In miri, casting a pointer to an integer does not actually do anything, we now just have an integer variable (i.e., its <em>type</em> says it is an integer) whose <em>value</em> is a pointer (i.e., an allocation-offset pair).
However, multiplying that “integer” by 2 leads to an error, because it is entirely unclear what it means to multiply such an abstract pointer by 2.</p>

<p>I should clarify that this is <em>not</em> a good solution when defining language semantics.
It works fine for an interpreter though.
It is the most lazy thing to do, and we do it because it is not clear what else to do (other than not supporting these casts at all – but this way, miri can run more programs):
In our abstract machine, there just is no single coherent “address space” that all allocations live in, that we could use to map every pointer to a distinct integer.
Every allocation is just identified by an (unobservable) ID.
We could now start to enrich this model with extra data like a base address for each allocation, and somehow use that when casting an integer back to a pointer… but that’s where it gets really complicated, and anyway discussing such a model is not the point of this post.
The point it to discuss the <em>need</em> for such a model.
If you are interested, I suggest you read <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Estevez/papers/KHM+15.pdf">this paper</a> that explores the above idea of adding a base address.</p>

<p>Long story short, pointer-integer casts are messy and hard to define formally when also considering optimizations like we discussed above.
There is a conflict between the high-level view that is required to enable optimizations, and the low-level view that is required to explain casting a pointer to an integer and back.
We mostly just ignore the problem in miri and opportunistically do as much as we can, given the simple model we are working with.
A full definition of a language like C++ or Rust of course cannot take this shortcut, it has to explain what really happens here.
To my knowledge, no satisfying solution exists, but academic research is <a href="http://sf.snu.ac.kr/publications/llvmtwin.pdf">getting closer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This was by no means meant to be an exhaustive list of academic research on C in general. I do not know of other work that focuses directly on the interplay of integer-pointer casts and optimizations, but other noteworthy work on formalizing C includes <a href="https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics">KCC</a>, <a href="https://robbertkrebbers.nl/thesis.html">Robbert Krebber’s PhD thesis</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">Cerberus</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<p>This is why pointers are not simple, either.</p>

<h2 id="from-pointers-to-bytes">From Pointers to Bytes</h2>

<p>I hope I made a convincing argument that integers are not the only data one has to consider when formally specifying low-level languages such as C++ or (the unsafe parts of) Rust.
However, this means that a simple operation like loading a byte from memory cannot just return a <code>u8</code>.
Imagine we <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/rlibc/blob/defb486e765846417a8e73329e8c5196f1dca49a/src/lib.rs#L39">implement <code>memcpy</code></a> by loading (in turn) every byte of the source into some local variable <code>v</code>, and then storing it to the target.
What if that byte is part of a pointer?  When a pointer is a pair of allocation and offset, what is its first byte?
We have to …</p></article></div>

                    <p>WireGuard is pretty great!</p><p>You might have noticed the buzz around <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> lately.
WireGuard is a very simple VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, and the buzz comes from both the fact that it’s simple and good at what it does, and the fact that it’s so good that it’s going to be included in the Linux kernel by default.
Linus Torvalds himself said that <a href="http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2018/08/02/124">he loves it</a>, which took the software world by storm, as we weren’t aware that Linus was capable of love or any emotion other than perkele.</p>
<p>The only problem I’ve found with WireGuard is a lack of documentation, or rather a lack of documentation where you expect it.
The <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">quickstart</a> guide, the first thing I look at, mentions a configuration file that it never tells you how to write, and it also assumes you’re more familiar with networking than I am.</p>
<p>Since the initial conditions at the creation of the universe set things up so WireGuard would eventually be underdocumented, I am going against Creation itself and showing you how to easily configure and run it.
Let’s <!-- break -->begin!</p>
<h2>Short overview</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/guard-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>A guard that looks kinda wiry, and makes sure you don't subconsciously find this post dry and boring.</span></p></div><p>At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another.
It doesn’t really let you access other computers on either end of the network, or forward all your traffic through the VPN server, or anything like that.
It just connects two computers, directly, quickly and securely.</p>
<p>To do anything other than that, you’ll need to configure your network for it, which is “out of scope” for the WireGuard docs, but which I consider very much in the scope of a VPN.
Luckily, WireGuard comes with a helper script, <code>wg-quick</code>, which will do pretty much everything the average user needs.
Keep in mind that the configuration files for <code>wg-quick</code> aren’t compatible with the <code>wg</code> executable, but <code>wg-quick</code> is all we’ll need, so that shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Let’s start setting everything up.</p>
<h2>Installation and setup</h2>
<p>To install WireGuard, see <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">the installation</a> page, it should be a pretty simple process.
After you’ve installed it, you will need to generate a private and a public key for each computer you want accessing the VPN.
Due to WireGuard’s design, both computers on either end of a connection will need to have each other’s public key.</p>
<p>Let’s generate these keys. On each of the computers that will be in the VPN, create the directory <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and run these commands <em>on each of the computers</em> in the directory you just created:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ <span>umask</span> <span>077</span>  <span># This makes sure credentials don't leak in a race condition.</span>
$ wg genkey <span>|</span> tee privatekey <span>|</span> wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</pre></div>
<p>This will generate two files, <code>privatekey</code> and <code>publickey</code> on each of the computers.
The <code>publickey</code> file is for telling the world, the <code>privatekey</code> file is secret and should stay on the computer it was generated on.
You need to paste the contents of these files in the config file, I’m afraid WireGuard doesn’t support referencing them by path yet.</p>
<p>If your VPN server is behind a NAT, you’ll also need to open a UDP port of your choosing (<code>51820</code> by default).
Do this for any computer you want to connect <em>to</em> (computers that you’ll connect <em>from</em> don’t need a port open, as far as I know, but correct me if I’m wrong).</p>
<h2>Common scenarios</h2>
<p>After you’ve done the above, you’re ready to configure WireGuard.
Go to <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and create a file called <code>wg0.conf</code> on each of your computers.
We’ll go over some common scenarions along with the configuration for each.</p>
<h3>Just a single connection</h3>
<p>If you just want a single connection between two computers (say, to connect your laptop to your home server), the configuration is pretty simple.
On the server, enter the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.1</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>51820</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2/32</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That’s all you need for the server.
Keep in mind that <code>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</code> is your home server’s <code>privatekey</code> file’s contents (<strong>not</strong> the path to the file, the actual <strong>contents</strong>, a long line of gibberish), and <code>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</code> is similarly the contents of your laptop’s <code>publickey</code> file.</p>
<p>For the client, here’s the configuration:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>

<span># This is for if you're behind a NAT and</span>
<span># want the connection to be kept alive.</span>
<span>PersistentKeepalive</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, replace the keys with the appropriate strings you generated.</p>
<p>As you can see, the addresses I picked for each computer are <code>192.168.2.1</code> and <code>192.168.2.2</code>, because that subnet was free in my setup.
If there’s an interface with that subnet on either computer, you should pick another one, such as <code>192.168.3.x</code>, to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>After writing the two files, run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> on the server and then on the client.
The two machines should now be connected if you entered the server’s IP in the config and configured the port correctly, and you should be able to <code>ping 192.168.2.1</code> from the VPN client and see the responses.
To close the connection again, just run <code>wg-quick down wg0</code>.</p>
<p>I repeat that <em>this setup only lets you access the server’s interface from the client</em>, it won’t forward any of your traffic over the server or let you access any other machines on the server’s LAN.</p>
<h3>Accessing your home LAN</h3>
<p>To actually access the server’s LAN, you’ll need to make a slight modification to the configuration.
On the server’s config file, at the end of the the <code>[Interface]</code> section, add these two lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PostUp</span>   <span>=</span> <span>iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
<span>PostDown</span> <span>=</span> <span>iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that your LAN interface is called <code>eth0</code>.
If it isn’t, change the lines above to the actual name.</p>
<p>On the client, add your LAN’s subnet under <code>AllowedIPs</code>.
For example, if your subnet is <code>192.168.1.x</code>, change <code>AllowedIPs</code> to look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Briefly, the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting acts as <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing">a routing table when sending, and an ACL when receiving</a>.
When a peer tries to send a packet to an IP, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code>, and if the IP appears in the list, it will send it through the WireGuard interface.
When it receives a packet over the interface, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code> again, and if the packet’s source address is not in the list, it will be dropped.</p>
<p>You might need to enable IP forwarding on the server for this to work, but it’s a simple process for Linux. <a href="http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/">Here’s a good guide</a>. If you’re running an OS X or Windows server, you don’t deserve nice things.</p>
<p>Then run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> as above, and you should be able to ping the other computers in the LAN from the client, as if you were home.
Try <code>ping 192.168.1.1</code> or any other computer in your LAN to verify.</p>
<p>Do note that <em>this won’t forward any other traffic</em> through your server, so it won’t proxy your web browsing or anything like that.
It will just let you talk to other machines on your server’s LAN.</p>
<p>For traffic forwarding, see below:</p>
<h3>Forwarding all your traffic through</h3>
<p>If you want to forward <em>all</em> your traffic through the VPN, WireGuard can easily do that as well.
Keep in mind that, if you’re doing this to avoid ISP tracking, it won’t work against your server’s ISP.
All your traffic will just look like it’s coming from your server, but if that’s at your house, all your torrents and porn downloading is just going to look like it’s coming from there, even though you’re at a net cafe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>To forward all the traffic through, simply change the <code>AllowedIPs</code> line on the client to this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here’s the entire client config again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will make the <code>wg0</code> interface responsible for routing all IP addresses (hence the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>), and should route all your traffic over your server.
You can check by loading one of the <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">what is my IP</a> websites and seeing that your server’s IP is what’s detected.</p>
<h2>Securing and running on startup</h2>
<p>After you’re done, run the following to make the directory and files readable only by administrators (it <em>does</em> contain secret keys, after all):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo chown -R root:root /etc/wireguard/
$ sudo chmod -R og-rwx /etc/wireguard/*
</pre></div>
<p>After you’ve created and secured the file, you can easily set WireGuard to initialize the VPN on startup if your OS is using <code>systemd</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl <span>enable</span> wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to start or stop the service:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I hope this has been useful!
It’s the guide I wish existed before I spent three hours trying to configure WireGuard, and hopefully you can just copy the configs and have it work right away.</p>
<p>If you need the configuration for IPv6, I’m afraid you’re going to have to experiment yourself, as my ISP does not support it, but feel free to let me know what should be added and I can amend the article.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Stavros">tweet</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.host/@stavros">toot</a> any comments to me, or leave a comment below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I'm taking a break from debugging books to talk about a calamitous shitshow of textbook writing: <i>Mastering C Pointers: Tools for Programming Power</i>, by Robert J. Traister.
</p>

<p>
I learned of the book through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SUkrR7ZfTA">talk</a> by Brian Kernighan where he refers to the book as probably “the worst C programming textbook ever written.”<span>[<a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a>]</span>
He doesn't name it but <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1003411102791692288">with some help</a> I was able to track down his obliquely accurate reference.
</p>

<p>
This book has become my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20whale">white whale</a>.
Since I started reading debugging books, and especially now that I'm digging through older ones, I find bits of advice that simply don't work today.
While some of it could be construed as useless or idiotic, I've always found the authors come from a position of earnestness, attempting to draw the best conclusions based on decent principles and what they knew at the time they wrote it.
In some cases they may not have known much, but they're honestly and humbly trying to impart some wisdom.
</p>

<p>
When Kernighan put up the following example, I saw what seemed to be the opposite of that.
</p>

<pre>char *combine(s, t)
char *s, *t;
{

      int x, y;
      char r[100];

      strcpy(r, s);
      y = strlen(r);
      for (x = y; *t != '\0'; ++x)
           r[x] = *t++;

      r[x] = '\0';

      return(r);

}
</pre>

<p>
This program (formatting preserved) is taken from the first edition of the book (p.146).
It's horrific (Kernighan calls it “malpractice”).
It does not exhibit the genuineness I have seen with, say, books from the late 1970s on how to debug BASIC programs.
I didn't know what it was.
Deceit?
Laziness?
Unremitting ignorance?
What is the mindset of someone who writes this, presumably thinking it's a good idea?
Can the whole book be that bad?
Kernighan said it was.
I had to know.
</p>

<p>
The book has two editions: the first was published in 1990, the second in 1993.
The fact that there are two editions piqued my curiosity even more.
It sold enough to make another version?
Is that horrible example corrected?
I obtained a copy of each and read them.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the book is pointless.
Kernighan was right: it's garbage.
And the second edition only makes things worse.
Teaching from either one would be a breach of ethics.
If you follow Traister’s coding practices, even adjusted for today's standards, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to create defects and vicious, latent bugs.
A subtly pernicious aspect of the book is the casual tone of the writing.
It’s informal enough that if you don’t really know much about C what he says sort of makes sense, despite the sloppy terminology and mixed, inaccurate metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Any trained programmer will recognize the lessons as worthless.
His terminology is all over the map and typically inaccurate, if not plainly wrong.
Expressions “return a value.”
Values are “handed” into locations.
Constants are “written directly into the program.”
A union is a “specialized pointer.”
The terminology isn’t even consistent.
Micro-optimizations are stressed at all times, and program efficiency is valued over comprehension.
He can’t even define a pointer correctly: “A pointer is a special variable that returns the address of a memory location.”
It does not take long to realize Traister has no idea what he’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Although I’m not going to go over the content (that would take far too long since there’s nothing redeeming there), I did take extensive notes.
You can <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/notes.html">read them</a>, if you are so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I must, however, take a moment to single out the code.
It is universally bad and much of it is simply wrong.
(Imagine trying to learn programming principles from a book that contains a large number of programs that don’t even compile.)
I’ve <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/code.html">transcribed</a> some of the programs and annotated them with comments so that you can get a taste of how inept Traister is as a C programmer.
One thing to keep in mind (both for the programs and the notes) is that C89/C90 was new at the time and that the code was written on (and for) MS-DOS systems of the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Things were a bit different then.
</p>

<p>
Enough about the material.
I want to explore the question of how something so wrong even got written.  It’s not that everything in the book is wrong, but it feels like when it’s right, it’s right by accident.
</p>

<p>
Traister has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-J.-Traister/e/B001H6UPHY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1529540256&amp;sr=1-1">written</a> other books, some about electronics and some about programming, one called <i>Going from BASIC to C</i>.
In <i>Mastering C Pointers</i>, he talks about a product he created called CBREEZE that converts BASIC code to C.
Throughout the book he makes passing, roundabout references to BASIC and uses terminology that suggests he’s written a lot of BASIC code.
For example, there is a whole chapter on using pointers to access memory, where reading and writing memory is instead called “peeking” and “poking”, based on the PEEK and POKE instructions in BASIC.
He also says that it took him a couple of tries to learn C coming from BASIC.
In short, I’m convinced he’s knowledgeable about BASIC and has worked on writing software for small, electronic devices.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important?
As I read the book (and if you read my notes, you know where this is going) I started to notice something in the wording and tone.
The further I progressed the more I became convinced of it, and I think it explains how he managed to mangle the explanation of C pointers so badly.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think he understands the call stack.
</p>

<p>
My argument for this interpretation requires a little knowledge of BASIC and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
With BASIC, the key thing to know about most implementations at the time is that there were no functions and no scope aside from the global scope.<span>[<a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a>]</span>
The closest thing to a function in BASIC is the GOSUB command.
The GOSUB command jumps to a line and executes code until it gets to a RETURN statement, where control is transferred back to the line following the GOSUB command.
Within a GOSUB you can jump somewhere else with another GOSUB.
The control follows a stack principle, but no arguments are passed.
GOSUB routines are a way to factor out common code, but that common code has to work on global variables.
(And yes, it’s as terrible as it sounds.)
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the case of simple electronic devices.
Even today some embedded devices, usually programmed using C, do not have a call stack that dynamically allocates space for automatic variables.
There simply isn’t enough memory for it.
Instead, the compiler lays out memory such that each function’s local variables have fixed memory addresses (a “compiled stack” model).
The only stack you have is for return addresses and it is probably handled in hardware.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you’re used to writing BASIC for small memory electronic devices and you learn about C.
You read about pointers and realize something: it’s possible to write a subroutine that can change variables <i>without knowing their names</i>.
It’s manna from heaven!
You don’t have to devote global variables to being the “parameters” of your subroutines anymore.
Life is great.
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset I think Traister had and never got past.
In the book there is one fleeting mention of the stack in reference to excessive (automatic) memory allocation.
(On MS-DOS, if the space for local variables is too large in the program, it might not compile.)
He consistently describes variables as having “exclusive” addresses in the program.
His writing about pointers suggests that he thinks, for each function, space is set aside to hold the local variables for the duration of the program, but you can only access them when inside the function in which they were declared.
So pointers are really powerful because you can provide this address to another function and it can change the value using only a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence for his lack of understanding is that he frequently cites ridiculous space micro-optimizations within functions, such as avoiding the use of integers for index variables, if possible.
Another one, mentioned often, is local <code>char</code> arrays that have a fixed size.
There are good reasons to not use them but his are not among them.
His admonishment is that they waste space.
Technically, that is true, but they don't exist until they're on the stack.
And he never talks about global or file variables.
He only refers to locals with “exclusive” addresses “set aside” for variables.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation runs into some problems once you start asking how functions with malloc will work, but it's worth pointing out that there is almost no discussion about memory management.
In a book devoted to C pointers, that's a toxic mix of gross negligence and incompetence.
There is literally one short paragraph devoted to talking about the <code>free</code> function—and it's characterized as a “side note.”
</p>

<p>
Another sticking point in this interpretation is Traister’s incomprehensible approach to writing functions that take a variable number of arguments.
He does this by passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function (the first being the number of arguments) and accessing them using offsets from the address of the first argument.
This suggests he has some idea about parameters being passed in a dynamic fashion, but it is so spectacularly wrong<span>[<a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a>]</span> you’re left wondering if he even tried his programs out before publishing them.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, this is the most generous interpretation of the text I could come up with, and it still paints a terrible picture.
Occam's Razor suggests that Traister is just clueless.
But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01l1WIC9mBo">analyzing a terrible movie</a> that somehow gets made, it's more fun to reason through the “behind the scenes” parts.
</p>

<p>
Given the ineptness of the book, you'd think it was self-published.
You would be wrong.
It was published through Academic Press, which was a division of Harcourt, Brace &amp; World at the time, but is now an “imprint of Elsevier.”
</p>

<p>
In the preface of the second edition it says that the first edition was reviewed “by a professional C programmer hired by the publisher.”
That programmer said it should not be published.
That programmer was right, but the publisher went ahead and …</p></div></div>

You can't even appreciate animal onesies?</figcaption></figure><p>The reason to write about this Twitter drama is pretty simple: Culture matters. As I've pointed out before, that's why <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/multiplayer-psychosis/">everyone gets so worked up</a>. It would be ludicrous to claim that conceptions of <em>coolness</em> don't have real-world effects; I can attest that my own street cred has been hugely advantageous, and I am by no means a big deal.</p><p>If we want to <a href="https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/">build the awesome future directly</a>, we need to point out who is a pernicious influence, who focuses on tearing others down rather than building them up — <em>especially</em> if they amass clout by doing so, then use it to initiate a negativity flywheel. Personally I can excuse moderate and occasional bitchiness (including from myself), but not the devoted focus of @VCBrags.</p><p>And yes, there should be reputational consequences for this behavior. Nobody needs to be fired, I'm not advocating for that, but bad-faith critics of the tech industry and those who work in it should be identified and ignored. After all, we genuinely do want to grow and improve! Meekly accepting malice, versus insisting on constructive feedback, undermines that effort.</p><p>So let's talk about Pasquale, this story's <em>enfant terrible</em>. It may be a tad confusing if you didn't see the saga unfold on Twitter — I won't recap every detail, but you can get up to speed here:</p><figure><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/09/01/the-enduring-mystery-around-an-anonymous-twitter-account-that-infuriated-techs-kingpins-and-nearly-ruined-a-founders-reputation/#4879f4d8548d"><div><p>The Enduring Mystery Around An Anonymous Twitter Account That Infuriated Tech’s Kingpins—And Nearly Ruined A Founder’s Reputation</p><p>By lampooning venture capitalists, @VCBrags accumulated an audience that included billionaires Jack Dorsey and Mark Cuban—and enmity from many of the people it skewered.</p><p><img src="https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png"><span>Abram Brown</span><span>Forbes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat(jpg)/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f4dbdc61f01affb0ae14e3e%2F0x0.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>That post is <em>mostly</em> accurate. Intriguingly, however, Forbes editor Abram Brown reported that Gumroad CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1298122211656523776">Sahil Lavingia</a> "still maintains he does know @VCBrags' true identity but declined to comment further and did not fully reveal his suspicions in his Twitter post." I gotta wonder how thoroughly Brown conducted his research:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 1174w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Sahil Lavingia Retweeted" — I followed along for 🍿 reasons and a full-time Forbes journalist missed what I noticed.

					<h2>Hypothesis testing, beyond the dumb exercises</h2>
					<p>August 07, 2020</p>
				</header>
				<p>Statistics is hard and generally counter-intuitive; these notes regard one of the most interesting tools it can provide, hypothesis testing.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis testing</h2>

<p>Whenever a researcher attempts a certain claim based on data, some statistics is involved.
Hypothesis testing is a theoretical framework for dealing with claims and assign them a certain reliability.
Meaning that we not only want to know if data supports a claim but also with which degree of probability.
Hypothesis testing is used for answering questions like: <em>is this new medicine really effective curing a certain disease?</em>, <em>is the new high-speed mass transport reducing commuting time?</em></p>

<p>In this context the claim is called the <em>hypothesis</em> and it is paired (for convenience) with its counterpart, the <em>null hypothesis</em> which simply negates it.</p>

<p>We are playing with the following (boring) toy example:</p>

<p>In the USA, elementary students are found with an average QI of 100.
The principal of the Springfield elementary school, Skinner, makes 30 students of his undertake a test and he finds out they have an average QI of 112.5 (with a standard deviation of 15).</p>

<p>Immediately, he calls the superintendent Chalmers to request more funds for his gifted pupils.
But is his claim statistically correct?</p>

<h2 id="z-test">Z-test</h2>

<p>Z-test is one of the hypothesis testing available tests and it is applicable when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Samples are IID (Independently, identically distributed);</li>
  <li>The number of samples is large (greater than 30) or the standard deviation  is known.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, Skinner collected  samples with average  which we consider IID.
Since , we do not care if  is the true standard deviation or a sample one (for  we should apply the T-test if  is a sample standard deviation).</p>

<p>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that:</p>

<p><em>For  large enough, the random variable  is distributed like a Gaussian </em></p>



<p>Here,  represents the mean of the distribution generating the samples.
Being the normal distribution symmetric, it naturally follows:</p>



<p>which is more straightforward for our purposes (because we are ultimately interested in the random variable ).</p>

<p>Note that the CLT works no matter what distribution generated the samples; <strong>the sample average will be always distributed as a Gaussian</strong>.</p>

<p>In our example, Skinner is trying to prove that the mean  for QI in Springfield school is not the same as the one for the rest of young kids in the USA.
His hypothesis is thus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>H1: </li>
</ul>

<p>while, Chalmers (and the hypothesis testing framework) are evaluating the opposite hypothesis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>H0: </li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, this framework accepts the initial hypothesis by rejecting the <em>null</em> hypothesis (a version of <em>Reductio ad absurdum</em>).</p>

<p>Namely, it is now Chalmers’ job to prove Skinner wrong (and negate further funding).
Chalmers picks a certain level of confidence, and claims that he will discard H0 only if it has a probability below .</p>

<p>From the CLT equation we obtain that:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mu \sim N(\bar{X},\frac{\sigma^2}{n})
\label{eq:mudist}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{\mu-\bar{X}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0, 1)
\label{eq:zdist}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>The first equation gives the probability distribution function for , based on the observed sample data.
The latter is the <em>Z</em> that gives the name to the test and represents the standardization of  wrt the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.</p>

<p>The following analysis and test is independent either we work on the  or the  random variable.
I think the former is more intuitive and the latter a residual of pre-computer era where people used to search in precomputed tables the values needed instead of interacting with a computer.
I present both approaches as the Z test is now widely accepted and discussed.</p>

<h3 id="mu-statistic"> statistic</h3>

<p>Back to our example, Skinner’s claim is that  is larger than 100 and its probability of being less than 100 is negligible.
Chalmers defines this negligibility as 5% of probability.</p>

<p>We call <em>-value</em> the probability under H0 to have observed our sample.
It represents the likelihood of the sample under H0.
In our example, the -value is the probability of having  for our sampled data.</p>

<p>The following image presents the distribution of  (the blue line) given our sample data, its average  and the cut at 100, the real average according to H0.
The -value is given by the area underlying the blue curve from  to .</p>

<p><img src="http://baldesi.ovh/images/2020-08-07_springfield_qi.png" alt="data frequencies"></p>

<p>Computing the probability -value  is hence trivial as computing the cumulative distribution function of the first equation, in Python</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy.stats as stats
&gt;&gt;&gt; stats.norm(112.5, 2.7386).cdf(100)
2.505e-06
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since -value  we can reject H0 and declare that H1 holds with a confidence of 95% (and possibly higher, till 1--value).
Skinner rejoices!</p>

<h3 id="z-statistic">Z statistic</h3>

<p>A more common way to proceed (but equivalent) with this test is using the Z statistic (the standardization of ).
We first compute  as Z under the H0 hypothesis:</p>



<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (100-112.5)*math.sqrt(30)/15
-4.564354645876384
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The image below presents this time the distribution of  (i.e., the distribution of the sample average given the observed sample data after standardization) which is nothing but the normal distribution with mean  and variance , and the cut point which this time is not directly , but its standardization, .</p>

<p><img src="http://baldesi.ovh/images/2020-08-07_springfield_qi_std.png" alt="data frequencies"></p>

<p>Given  and the  distribution function we now hence compute the probability  which is the area underlying the blue curve in the above image from  to .</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt; stats.norm(0,1).cdf(-4.56)
2.5051659781952214e-06
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Consequently, -value .
Again, since -value is less than  we reject H0 in favor of H1.</p>

<h2 id="t-test">T-test</h2>

<p>The T-test has been developed to address the limitation of the Z-test regarding the sample size.
It still requires the samples to be IID but it can be safely used whatever value of  we have.</p>

<p>Everything works as in the case of the Z-test, but we focus on the  statistic instead of the  one:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
T = \frac{\mu-\bar{X}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim T(n-1)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>In fact,  is still the distribution of the sample average given the observed sample data after standardization, but we know that for sample variance with  it does not distribute anymore like a normal distribution but, instead, like a student distribution (which is also symmetric and bell-shaped).</p>

<p>Here,  indicates the sample standard deviation and  represents the t-student distribution function with  degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Again, we can compute the cutting value:</p>



<p>Again, as in the latter case of the Z-test, we compute the p-value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; stats.t(29).cdf(-4.56)
4.3005975438384246e-05
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(The interested reader might appreciate that for  the t-student and Gaussian distributions converge and  has been selected as the threshold at which the two distribution are not significantly different anymore. Hence, we can use the normal distribution and the Z-test with sample variance when ).
Which yields to the same comparison, -value </p>

<p>Hence, Chalmers has to surrender and recognize Springfield kids result more clever than the average USA student.
From here to invest more funding in their education, though, it is all another story.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantum entanglement has attracted some attention from the public that this mysterious process might be useful for lots of future applications, such as quantum computing and teleportation.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss quantum entanglement superficially using mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-entanglement">Quantum Entanglement</h3>

<p>Assume we have two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$, represented respectively by the vector spaces $\mathbb{V}$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime}$. The quantum system obtained by merging $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ will have the tensor product $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime}$ as a state space.</p>



<p>If $\mathbb{V} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ with basic states $| x_0 \rangle, | x_1 \rangle, \cdots, | x_{n-1} \rangle$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^m$ with basic states $| y_0 \rangle, | y_1 \rangle, \cdots, | y_{m-1} \rangle$, the tensor product state space would be $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times m}$ with basic states $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq j \leq m-1$. Here, the basic state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ means the first quantum systems $Q$ is in the state $| x_i \rangle$ and the second quantum system $Q^{\prime}$ is in the state $| y_j \rangle$.</p>



<p>More independent quantum systems $Q_0, Q_1, \cdots, Q_{k-1}$ could be merged together and the state space of the merged quantum system would be $\mathbb{V}_0 \otimes \mathbb{V}_1 \otimes \cdots\ \otimes \mathbb{V}_{k-1}$.</p>



<p>The system state of the merged quantum system from two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ could be expressed using basic states.</p><p>

\[| \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{i,j} | x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle\]

</p><p>The probability of the system being in the state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ after measurement, according to quantum mechanics, would be</p><p>

\[P(| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle) = \frac{|c_{i,j}|^2}{\sum_{s=0}^{n-1} \sum_{t=0}^{m-1} |c_{s,t}|^2 }\]

</p><p>If $c_{i,j} = 0$, then $P(| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle) = 0$</p>



<p>We further consider the merged system whose $n = 2$ and $m = 2$.</p><p>

\[| \psi \rangle = c_{0,0} | x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle + c_{0,1} | x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle + c_{1,0} | x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle + c_{1,1} | x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle\]

</p><p>Suppose $c_{0,0} = 0$, $c_{0,1} = 1$, $c_{1,0} = 1$, $c_{1,1} = 0$, i.e.,</p><p>

\[| \psi \rangle = | x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle + | x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle\]

</p><p>When we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| x_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle$. Similarly, when we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q^{\prime}$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| y_0 \rangle$ or $| y_1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>If we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_0 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_1 \rangle$ even without measurement. Similarly, if we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_1 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_0 \rangle$ even without measurement. This is because the probability of observing $| x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle$ is 0.</p>



<p>This is called quantum entanglement.</p>



<p>In this case, no matter how far the two subsystems in the entangled system is, we know the system states of both subsystems by just observing one single subsystem.</p>



<p>The quantum entanglement is simultaneous and instantaneous. If we describe this process using “velocity”, we would find the “velocity” is infinitely large, faster than light speed, which is the fastest “velocity” we are currently using for information transmission. However, we prefer not to describe this process using velocity, since it is not a conventional physical “travel” process.</p>



<p>Formally, if a merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ can be broken into the tensor product of states from the constituent subsystems, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{i,j} | x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle \\
&amp;= \Big(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_{x, i} | x_i \rangle \Big) \otimes \Big(\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{y, j} | y_j \rangle \Big) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{x, i} c_{y, j} | x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We call this merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ separable state. Otherwise we call it entangled state, as we would find there is no solution to solve the above equation for an entangled state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Some people who did not study physics sometimes described the process of quantum entanglement as if there is a causation relationship, which means that it is the state of one subsystem affecting the other subsystem. However, from our mathematics analysis, we know this causation relationship does not exist.</p>

<p>According to Einstein’s theory that <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Matter-Cannot-Travel-Faster-Than-Light/">matter cannot travel faster than light</a>, anything that has mass could not travel faster than light speed. The “instance information transimission velocity” in the entangled quantum system does not vilate Einstein’s theory, in my opinion, because it is not transimission at all and should not be considered as velocity.</p>



<p>For example, suppose we have two pre-synchronized accurate clock in Beijing, China and San Francisco, USA, respectively. At 0:00 AM PST according to the two clocks, two people at Beijing and San Francisco send a light beam to a satellite simutaneously. The satellite will receive the two light beams almost simutaneously. Without knowing what is happening on the earth, can the satellite draw conclusion that because the two people from Beijing and San Francisco were sending light beams simutaneously, these two people must have communicated with each other before sending the light beams, and the communication velocity is greater than light speed? The answer is defnitely no.</p>

        <p>Before you will spend the next 10 to 20 minutes reading about eBPF, let me say a few words to start this blog. This is my first blog post and it originates from a paper I had to write for class in Uni a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed learning about eBPF and thought it’s a good topic to start my own blog, with the goal of posting here once in a while about tech stuff I have been working or playing with. If you find things that are wrong and need to be corrected, or just want to contact me for other reasons, feel free to reach out through any forms of contact mentioned on this website.</p>
<p>That’s all I have to say really, so lets get into the cool stuff.</p>
<p>The <em>extended Berkeley Packet Filter</em> (eBPF) provides a way of accessing in-kernel data structures and functions, which enables processing data directly in the kernel without copying it to user-space.</p>
<p>In this post, we will talk about eBPF. Starting with its predecessor called BPF, initially described by <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">McCanne and Jacobson</a>, I will also explain eBPFs architecture and cover how security risks introduced by the concept of executing user-space code in kernel-space are mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need&nbsp;eBPF?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of programs, e.g. network monitors, run as user-level processes. In order to analyze data that passes only through the kernel, they have to copy that data into user-space memory and perform context switches. That results in a significant performance overhead compared to analyzing that data directly inside the kernel.</p>
<p>Additionally, network speeds and traffic volumes have increased exponentially in recent years. Certain applications have to handle huge amounts of data. For example, the video-streaming service Netflix is accountable for about <a href="https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/downloads/phenomena/2018-%20phenomena-report.pdf">15% of the global downstream volume</a>.</p>
<p>At some point, monitoring that much traffic only in user-space is no longer feasible and one solution is to use eBPF programs.</p>
<p>Besides performance benefits, eBPF programs offer safety and flexibility as it is possible to write and compile eBPF programs at run-time. By not doing any direct kernel programming (e.g. kernel modules), we avoid recompiling the kernel with every change. We also prevent resource lock-ups, potential memory corruption, entire system crashes and introducing security risks.</p>
<p><strong>What is&nbsp;eBPF?</strong></p>
<p>The eBPF is a full VM inside the kernel, that allows user-space programs to access a subset of kernel functions. One of the main advantages of eBPF is that you do not have to write kernel modules and there is no need to recompile the kernel for eBPF programs to take effect.</p>
<p>Programs can live in user-space, load the eBPF part of the program into the kernel, then get processed and attached to the correct place by the eBPF VM. The user-space program can then read any results from the eBPF program it loaded via data structures (eBPF maps) that are readable in user-space.</p>
<p>The kernel functions that are accessible by eBPF are mostly used for tracing and filtering directly inside the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-ofhistory">A bit of&nbsp;history</h2>
<p><strong>The BSD Packet Filter</strong></p>
<p>BPF was introduced in 1992 in the paper <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf"><em>The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture for User-level Packet Capture</em></a>. At the time of writing, BPF was about two years old and running in the BSD Kernel. McCanne and Jacobson defined BPF to have two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>The network tap that collects packets from the network driver and forwards them to listening filter applications.</li>
<li>The packet filter, realized by an in-kernel VM that runs bytecode which will perform the filtering actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, they describe BPF as a very well performing tool to monitor, capture, and filter networking packets. The paper continues with a comparison of BPF to other filtering mechanisms, which are shown to be outperformed by BPF.</p>
<p>McCanne and Jacobson also outline some of the design constraints for BPF. Two of them are important for its future development:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>“It must be protocol independent. The kernel should not have to be modified to add new protocol support.”</em></li>
<li><em>“It must be general. The instruction set should be rich enough to handle unforeseen uses.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Those constraints allowed BPF to transform into what we know as eBPF today.</p>
<p><strong>Extended BPF</strong></p>
<p>While BPF was proven to have good performance, in 2013 Alexei Starovoitov proposed the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/30/627"><em>extended BPF</em></a>.</p>
<p>Building upon the generality and protocol independence of BPF, his proposal allowed read-only access to certain in-kernel data structures. This enables many more tracing capabilities for eBPF since it is <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/2/1066">not just limited to networking functions</a>.</p>
<p>Starovoitov also introduced some changes to modernize the architecture and further improve performance. Most notably:</p>
<ol>
<li>The instruction set was extended. BPF had two 32-bit registers, eBPF has eleven 64-bit registers.</li>
<li>eBPF uses <em>Just-In-Time</em> (JIT) compilation.</li>
<li>It is possible to write eBPF programs in restricted C.</li>
</ol>
<p>In March 2016, Branden Gregg posted <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-03-05/linux-bpf-%20superpowers.html">an article on his blog</a> arguing that eBPF brings “superpowers” to Linux. He describes how eBPF gives him much more insight into Netflix’s production servers and introduces the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc"><em>BPF Compiler Collection</em> (BCC)</a>.</p>
<p>This set of tools he and others developed are making use eBPFs tracing functionalities to give various insights into the operating system stack. Today BCC also offers various Programming language (Go, Python, etc.) support to write eBPF programs.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>In this section, we will see the higher level architecture of eBPF as well as some details on the VM design.</p>
<p>When talking about VMs, most people will think of virtualization and containerization. These are techniques to abstract the hardware or operating system level to higher level software. In the case of eBPFs VM this is not true. The eBPF VM translates eBPF bytecode into native code, just as the JVM translates java bytecode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executing user-space code in the kernel introduces some risks. The common understanding without eBPF is a strict split between user-space and kernel-space. So how does eBPF guarantee safety when breaking that model? To answer that question, the section introduces the <em>Verifier</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Program flow</strong></p>
<p>To show the higher level architecture of eBPF lets go over the program flow of a user writing code that leverages eBPF to access kernel-space functions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/eBPF/linux_ebpf_internals.png"><img src="https://rgo3.dev/img/ebpf-architecture.png" alt="eBPF architecture from a user/kernel split perspective"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>A user-space program has to generate eBPF bytecode. To do this a user can either write C code, use existing tools, or an available programming language extension which can be found in the BCC.</li>
<li>The generated bytecode needs to be loaded into the Kernel. For that Linux has introduced a new system call: bpf(). It is available in Linux since v.3.18 (released in December 2014), which was the first release to include eBPF.</li>
<li>The eBPF bytecode gets verified by the <em>Verifier</em>. We will look into its specific role later but its purpose is to verify the loaded bytecode to be safe for execution inside the kernel.</li>
<li>The eBPF VM JIT-compiles the bytecode into native code for the underlying architecture and attaches it to the correct place. The image above shows various examples of in-kernel functions to use. E.g. <em>kprobes</em> was developed to do dynamic kernel tracing or its user- level equivalent <em>uprobes</em> which enables dynamic user- level tracing.</li>
<li>eBPF has two ways of communicating back to user-space. It can either emit per-event details, or write results into BPF maps that are readable by the user program. These maps can represent <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/ebpf.html">arrays, hash maps, histograms and other common data structures</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A VM inside the kernel</strong></p>
<p>Now that we understand the higher-level architecture and the program flow of running eBPF programs, we want to look at some details of the VM itself. The eBPF VM is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) register machine.</p>
<p>This means that eBPF, as any hardware Instruction Set (x86, amd64, ARM), has its own instructions and a number of registers, reduced to the functionality of calling in-kernel functions.</p>
<p>Starovoitov described this RISC register machine in <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/30/627">his first eBPF proposal</a>. eBPF has eleven registers and its calling convention is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>R0 is the return register for in-kernel helper functions.</li>
<li>R1 — R5 are in-kernel function argument registers.</li>
<li>R6 — R9 are callee saved registers.</li>
<li>R10 is a read-only frame pointer register to access the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>While eBPF already enables for faster execution of these programs due to running them directly in the kernel and saving on context switches between user-space and the kernel, this design allows for minimal performance overhead as well because eBPFs bytecode instruction set and all its eleven registers can be mapped 1-to-1 with modern 64-bit hardware architectures (x86, amd64, ARM) when JIT-compiling to native code.</p>
<p><strong>The Verifier</strong></p>
<p>As tempting it seems to execute user-space code directly in kernel-space, it should immediately raise security questions. There is a reason why the original operating system design separates these two address spaces. Operating system security is deeply rooted in the user/kernel split design. But eBPF has a solution to that problem.</p>
<p>The solution is to verify the code for safety by the <em>Verifier</em>. Code verification is a complex problem, unsolvable even if you try to verify arbitrary code for its outcome as proven by Alan Turing in 1936 with <a href="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230">the halting problem</a>.</p>
<p>That means the <em>Verifier</em> needs to impose certain limitations on the code we are able to execute in the kernel with eBPF. While this of course implicates drawbacks for the power of eBPF, it is a necessary part of running untrusted code in the kernel.</p>
<p><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/30/627">Starovoitov’s proposal</a> essentially outlines the following protection mechanisms used by the <em>Verifier</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a <em>Depth-First-Search</em> to disallow loops.</li>
<li>Simulate an eBPF program instruction for instruction and check register contents.</li>
</ol>
<p>These mechanisms have big implications for eBPF programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not Turing complete because we do not allow endless loops. This is very important to satisfy one of the motivations mentioned in the beginning.</li>
<li>We are able to avoid problems such as system lockups. If a user were able to submit a eBPF program containing an endless loop, that would effectively enable a <em>Denial-of- …</em></li></ul></div></div>

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>



<center>—</center>



<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Notes</p>



<p>I could go on and on …</p></div></div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Looking to lower your cloud costs?</h3>
<p>Our “Cloud Done Right: Effective Cost Management” eBook provides tried, tested, and proven cost management methods for both Azure and AWS.</p>
<p>It shines a light on some of the most common cloud-related misconceptions and provides real-world examples of how to successfully leverage the cloud to see a return on investment.</p>
<p>In it, you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to effectively combine your migration &amp; modernisation efforts</li>
<li>How to save up to 72% with Azure Reserved Instances</li>
<li>How to use AWS Cost Management to control your expenses</li>
<li>How AWS Serverless architecture costs compare to traditional hosting</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s inside the “Cloud Done Right: Effective Cost Management” eBook?</h2>
<h3>Cloud Modernisation &amp; Migration: The Perfect Pair?</h3>
<p>IDG’s survey found that 67% of respondents see modernisation efforts as essential to digital transformation. However, migration for the sake of migration isn’t the right catalyst for cloud adoption. We recommend looking at the big picture and figuring out what you’d like your systems to look like in the long run. This section of the eBook covers how to effectively approach your migration and modernisation needs, what to avoid on your cloud journey, and how to select the right cloud partner.</p>
<h3>Azure Cloud Cost Management: Key Optimisations</h3>
<p>Azure cost management and optimisation require practical knowledge and insight – in fact, you might even need to conduct an audit of your infrastructure. However, the key to effective cost optimisation is to get value within a short period of time. Otherwise, you might overinvest in an investigation that could yield findings not worth the time and effort. In this section of the eBook, you’ll learn about certain quick tweaks you can make to your Azure infrastructure to save a portion of your budget.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost Management: How to Control Expenses?</h3>
<p>According to IDG, 69% of organisations find that their cloud costs are higher than they anticipated. The AWS Cost Management tool suite allows customers to quickly and easily generate custom billing reports. This section of the eBook will teach you how to generate sample reports and help you familiarise yourself with a few quick wins, which we identified in our cloud projects.</p>
<h3>Do More &amp; Pay Less with AWS Serverless</h3>
<p>While, in theory, the FaaS computing model promises that you will bear ‘no costs for idle servers’, the question is: how does this work in practice? Are there any hidden costs and, if so, where are they? For this section of the eBook, we created an example booking web application to calculate how much an AWS Serverless solution actually costs. The results of the experiment will enable you to learn how AWS Serverless architecture is billed and how to estimate the associated monthly costs.</p>

			<div>
<p>This summer I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 at PostgreSQL Global Development Group. During these 3 months, I was working on performance and safety features for <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g">WAL-G</a> utility. I went through this summer journey together with my mentors <a href="https://github.com/g0djan">Georgy Rylov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/x4m">Andrey Borodin</a>. In this post, I will mainly focus on the work done during the program.</p>



<p>WAL-G is a tool written in Go for backing up and restoring PostgreSQL clusters (most recently MySQL, MongoDB, and FoundationDB too). It supports Amazon S3 storages (and S3 compatible analogs, like Yandex Object Storage), as well as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Swift Object Storage, and the file system.</p>



<p>In its core functionality, WAL-G is a successor of WAL-E but written in Go. WAL-G works much faster than WAL-E and also has some new cool features, one of them is delta-backups. Delta-backup, whenever possible, stores only pages, changed since the previous backup. When a full recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last base backup plus all of the delta<em> </em>backups until the point of restoration.</p>



<p>The goal of the project was to make two enhancements:</p>



<p>The first one was to improve the performance of the backup fetch process by implementing delta-backups unpacking in reverse order to avoid rewriting the same pages along with the following backup structure reorganization to avoid downloading unnecessary files.</p>



<p>The second was to provide users with the features to verify backup consistency, such as WAL’s history consistency check and page checksum verification.</p>



<p>These two enhancements were implemented as four features:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#unpackreverse">Unpack delta-backups in reverse order</a></li><li><a href="#reorganizebackup">Reorganize backup structure to avoid downloading unnecessary files</a></li><li><a href="#walhistorycheck">WAL’s history consistency check</a></li><li><a href="#checksumverification">Page checksum verification</a></li></ul>



<p>All of the four features by now are merged into WAL-G master branch. You can try them by cloning the<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g"> WAL-G repo</a>.</p>



<h2 id="unpackreverse">Unpacking delta backups in reverse order</h2>



<p>When restoring from delta backup, WAL-G at first unpacks the oldest version of the page files from base backup and then applies delta backups to the base version in historical order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CSh90AC62ojlPE7uCv0Ms2xl-buHF--mp3qZ8mb6bCGeK3V7D-S_92aaOTHFBI0h6NuAZ6fCci8DdV__6_kwh2sfVrYGsYSE1FAdWhCiHO-HxV9rygxaJXR112AuT9ERexCQkMYt" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G default backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that there are page blocks in the older backup which are going to be completely overwritten by their version from the newer backup, thus resulting in unnecessary writes to disk. The main goal of this feature was to improve backup fetch performance by implementing an unpack of delta backups in reverse order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEyTQyTvj1VzFKlSO4Jd2FQW_xofm2TBKxnHXSyY7AN94SDPFDppYL6E7J4F7QFspmLTqoFIrSVJlGIdPT99aNOV0ABgiRoNPjAmH7upqLWHy6xE5JHB3KDnDjkbEeppyAXFRzvF" alt=""><figcaption>Reverse backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this approach, pages are written to the disk only once, which noticeably improves backup restore performance. The main idea was to create page files from the latest delta backup at first, then fill the missing information from the following delta backups and the base backup.</p>



<p>The following text describes how WAL-G creates the page file without unnecessary page overwrites. It will focus on the most non-trivial case when the page file was modified multiple times since the first appearance in the base backup. Other more trivial cases are omitted for briefness. The page file is restored using the following scheme:</p>



<ol><li>Create page file from delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the previous delta</li><li>…</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the first delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the base backup</li></ol>



<h4>Create page file from delta</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G3T7fENlEHMmJUn327j1rAPyO_dzHDMYj8b7UCi5fVuTs1r_BCiO2lADT4feALN5NHdeD28F5XBVFdi5_2GQwrPqS5IRw4jpzA-T5V6EBYUwoXGwqxi0NwJDl5Y1OjQLc_RBBRmd" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G increment file header</figcaption></figure>



<p>WAL-G uses the information from the header of the delta page file to extract the final size of the page file. Knowing the final size of the page file and the PostgreSQL page size, it is possible to calculate the page count needed to write on the disk. For each page WAL-G performs the following algorithm to write the pagefile:</p>



<ol><li>If this page exists in delta backup, write it to the page file</li><li>If this page does not exist in the delta, write an empty page block to the page file</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ov865hrbNync4w4GYeICfb4qU2q4elCY5xetoJ2fglJgSjORdAPW_ywlJmHJE2t3LXjhxFheOkZ-BKnBWkQGs8YcoogD9E-dR8aZS55TyIJq-4O9DBkW9RjTvq9VSRzwfwYi25ij" alt="" width="372" height="249"><figcaption>Structure of the created page file</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the N-th delta to the page file</h4>



<p>For each next delta, WAL-G needs to write only the missing information to the page files. For each page in N-th delta backup WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the page from delta</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qraIB_-HykTegsB2Hkuhf1GsyCcL_p8PWXYwQKzKeWC1zAQBaXA0jxa6t2WcKBycDR3zG51BZhdMBftYucTB0XB3QfXnCL9JT36FlrW9uUvV-a1zv7D6ujxt0NFKGwNvwOpdwoQq" alt=""><figcaption>Application of N-th delta to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the base backup to the page file</h4>



<p>After WAL-G reached the base backup, it needs to get the missing pages from the base backup page file version. For each page in the local page file WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the base backup page</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9lBoXoMFN54cDWH9GCyXVgz4k_VxHYG6xAhmude06gNmTrVF7tLHzIHOgXwNIXSJ3jgwuXjM8P4FjK9JraZSjOtdLC4J2U1Nkf_P7nvuU-dJJN35FsZqAITcr9NrTxBDTICWh7t_" alt=""><figcaption>Application of base backup to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve implemented the proposed approach and measured performance improvement. WAL-G with reverse delta unpack turned on demonstrated about 2.5x faster backup restore compared to the standard WAL-G. If you are interested in more details, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/benchmarks/reverse-delta-unpack-26-03-2020.md">complete benchmark report</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reorganizebackup">Reorganization of backup structure</h2>



<p>After the implementation of the reverse delta unpack feature disk load and overall performance during backup-fetch<strong> </strong>has been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, WAL-G still needed to download absolutely all backup files from the cloud. However, with the reverse delta unpack feature implemented it wasn’t longer necessary – for example, there may have been a situation when WAL-G already had a consistent local version (no missing page blocks) of each file in the archive that was going to be downloaded. In this case, the archive contained only outdated files that aren’t useful anyway, so WAL-G can skip the download of the entire archive and proceed to the next one. The goal was to avoid downloading these unnecessary archives from the cloud and improve the WAL-G backup fetch performance even more 🙂</p>



<p>WAL-G stores each backup in the cloud split into several compressed archives. The problem is that to check which files exist in the archive you need to download and decompress it from the storage. The main idea is quite simple – store the contents of each archive in a backup JSON sentinel file so WAL-G can skip the archives without interesting files without downloading them.</p>



<pre><code>{ // this is a sample backup sentinel JSON file 
  "PgVersion": 120002,
  "UncompressedSize": 500781396,
  "CompressedSize": 100243768,
  "LSN": 17448304680,
  "DeltaCount": 8,
  "DeltaFromLSN": 16743661608,
  "SystemIdentifier": 6847498813832237599,
  "DeltaFullName": "base_00000003000000030000002F",
  "TarFileSets": { // new field to store information of contents of each tar archive here
    "part_001.tar.lz4": [
      "/",
      "/base",
      "/base/1",
      "/base/13689",
      "/base/13690",
      "/base/16384",
      "/base/16384/1259",
      "/base/16384/16397",
...
    ],
    "part_003.tar.lz4": [
      "tablespace_map",
      "backup_label"
    ]
  },
  "Files": {...},
  "DeltaFrom": "base_0000000300000003000000E6_D_0000000300000003000000D6",
  "FinishLSN": 17448304952,
  "Spec": null
}</code></pre>



<p>We’ve successfully implemented this approach and now WAL-G stores the contents of each backup archive in backup sentinel JSON by default. However, with this approach, the case when all of the files in the archive can be skipped may be quite rare. For a file that is being updated frequently, there is a high chance that some delta backup will contain only outdated information about it that WAL-G won’t need. And vice versa, if some file is being updated rarely, there is a high chance that delta backup will still hold some required data so we can’t skip the archive containing this file and we need to download the entire archive.</p>



<p>That’s why we developed an additional backup creation mode (<code><code>rating composer</code></code>) based on file update ratings. The idea was to place the files with a similar update frequency in the same archives so we can get the higher chance of the entire archive to be skipped. WAL-G needed to somehow determine the update frequency for each file in the database cluster folder. Luckily, for paged files, there is information from Postgres statistics collector – particularly <code>n_tup_ins</code>, <code>n_tup_del</code>, <code>n_tup_upd</code> columns from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> view.</p>







<p>In the rating composer mode, during backup creation, for each file WAL-G calculates the updates count using the data from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> and stores it in the current backup sentinel JSON. If available, WAL-G also reads the <code>previousUpdatesCount</code> – previous updates count value from the previous backup sentinel JSON. Using these values WAL-G then calculates the <code>updateRating</code> for each file: <code>(currentUpdatesCount * 100) / previousUpdatesCount</code>. Finally, all that left to do is:</p>



<ol><li>Sort all the files in the current backup by their <code>updateRating</code></li><li>Start packing files into archive from the file with the highest update rating</li><li>When the size of the files packed in the current archive exceeds the <code>WALG_TAR_SIZE_THRESHOLD</code> limit, create the new archive, and go to step 2.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, seems like we’re done… But actually no. To speed up things a little bit, WAL-G can do concurrent packing of multiple tar archives during backup creation (<code>WALG_UPLOAD_DISK_CONCURRENCY</code> setting). If you look closely, the above algorithm can’t be parallelized in straightforward …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>curl 4.8 was released in 1998 and contained 46 command line options. <code>curl --help</code> would list them all. A decent set of options.</p>



<p>When we released <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">curl 7.72.0</a> a few weeks ago, it contained 232 options… and <code>curl --help</code> still listed all available options.</p>



<p>What was once a long list of options grew over the decades into a crazy long wall of text shock to users who would enter this command and option, thinking they would figure out what command line options to try next.</p>



<h2>–help me if you can</h2>



<p>We’ve known about this usability flaw for a while but it took us some time to figure out how to approach it and decide what the best next step would be. Until this year when long time curl veteran Dan Fandrich did his presentation at curl up 2020 titled <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/video/curlup-2020/help%2520me%2520if%2520you%2520can.webm">–help me if you can</a>.</p>



<p>Emil Engler subsequently picked up the challenge and converted ideas surfaced by Dan into reality and proper code. Today we merged the refreshed and improved <code>--help</code> behavior in curl.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most notable change in curl for many users in a long time. Targeted for inclusion in the pending 7.73.0 release.</p>



<h2>help categories</h2>



<p>First out, <code>curl --help</code> will now by default only list a small subset of the most “important” and frequently used options. No massive wall, no shock. Not even necessary to pipe to <code>more</code> or <code>less</code> to see proper.</p>



<p>Then: each curl command line option now has one or more categories, and the help system can be asked to just show command line options belonging to the particular category that you’re interested in.</p>



<p>For example, let’s imagine you’re interested in seeing what curl options provide for your HTTP operations:</p>



<pre>$ curl --help http
Usage: curl [options…]
http: HTTP and HTTPS protocol options
--alt-svc Enable alt-svc with this cache file
--anyauth Pick any authentication method
--compressed Request compressed response
-b, --cookie Send cookies from string/file
-c, --cookie-jar Write cookies to after operation
-d, --data HTTP POST data
--data-ascii HTTP POST ASCII data
--data-binary HTTP POST binary data
--data-raw HTTP POST data, '@' allowed
--data-urlencode HTTP POST data url encoded
--digest Use HTTP Digest Authentication
[...]</pre>



<h2>list categories</h2>



<p>To figure out what help categories that exists, just ask with <code>curl --help category</code>, which will show you a list of the current twenty-two categories:<strong> auth, connection, curl, dns, file, ftp, http, imap, misc, output, pop3, post, proxy, scp, sftp, smtp, ssh, telnet ,tftp, tls, upload and verbose.</strong> It will also display a brief description of each category.</p>



<p>Each command line option can be put into multiple categories, so the same one may be displayed in both in the “http” category as well as in “upload” or “auth” etc.</p>



<h2><code>--help all</code></h2>



<p>You can of course still get the old list of every single command line option by issuing <code>curl --help all</code>. Handy for grepping the list and more.</p>



<h2>“important”</h2>



<p>The meta category “important” is what we use for the options that we show when just <code>curl --help</code> is issued. Presumably those options should be the most important, in some ways.</p>

<p>My mother told me that when I was very young, I would always look out the window in the evenings for the police car that would often sit on our street each night during the late shift. On a night when a car didn’t appear, and my father couldn’t get me to sleep, he would put me in a stroller and walk around until we saw one. I grew up on shows like Dragnet and games like Police Quest, and when I told my neighbors that I wanted to be a cop when I grew up, they’d tell me, “You’re too smart for that.”</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Years later, when I was in university, I watched friends get harassed by police. I’d watch videos of excessive force leading to accidental shootings. I had friends who were facing thousands of dollars in fines and legal fees, as well as jail time or community service, for possession of marijuana. A black friend of mine had the police called on him, while he was jogging in his own neighborhood. I watched police illegally search vehicles on my street in Cincinnati, and my friends and I would call out “<em>careful, pigs</em>” when we saw police vehicles out on the side of the road.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/philosophy/security/police/">much younger me</a> would probably join with much of the anti-police rhetoric we see today. Yet, despite all of this, I remember that police are still human. Back when I still had my <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/philosophy/faith/">faith</a>, every Sunday I’d sit in a pew next to a good friend whose father was a cop, and a church elder. In my current city, a police officer I know hosts traveling folk musicians for large concerts in his home. In New Zealand, a police officer did a full investigation after a <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/philosophy/faith/fate-and-destiny/">break-in</a>, even though it was likely to be a fruitless endeavor. I’ve watched police officers not only de-escalate situations, but do some amazing and incredible things, beyond what they needed to do for their job.</p>

<h3 id="body-cameras-tell-a-different-story">Body Cameras Tell a Different Story</h3>

<p>Both patrol car cameras and police body cameras provide a tremendous amount of context to situations, something which has never been available before. They’ve been pivotal in showing misconduct and holding police accountable, such as when Trooper Matthew Spina of Connecticut threatened to throw someone over a bridge during a traffic stop<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">1</a></sup>. But they’ve also been incredibly effective in clearing police in controversial incidents.</p>

<p>In September 2019, protests were held in St. Paul, Minnesota over a police officer fatally shooting Ronald Davis. People were crying out for justice, yet eventually police body camera footage revealed that Davis rammed a police vehicle, and within seconds, ran toward the police car and repeatedly attempted to stab the officer with a knife<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">2</a></sup>. Similarly, De’Von Bailey was a man shot in Colorado Springs in August of 2019. Many activist protested his death, both on the street and on social media, claiming the shooting was murder. However, the combination of the 911 call and police body camera footage clearly showed that De’Von had a firearm, and attempted to pull the firearm as he ran from police officers<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Donut Operator, a former police officer turned YouTuber and skateboard shop owner, does some amazing breakdowns of police shootings based on body camera and security camera footage. His coverage of these events really opened my eyes to the complexities of these police shootings, and the differences between how they’re often portrayed in the media compared to how they actually transpired. I don’t agree with all his breakdowns, such as in a recent video where he praises a police officer who shoots a man who took a hostage in Salt Lake City<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">4</a></sup>. The officer didn’t attempt to de-escalate the situation, and it could have gone horribly wrong had the officer missed and hit the hostage. The family of the hostage taker also criticized the actions as unnecessary<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Still, the body camera provides a truly incredible tool for objectively evaluating police actions. They help hold both police and the people they investigate accountable. In Louisville, after a fatal shooting in May, police officers were relieved of duty, and the police chief was fired, after it was found the officers did not have their body cameras activated<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">6</a></sup>. As more police departments adopt body cameras, hopefully we will see an increase of zero tolerance policies for officers who intentionally disable them.</p>

<h3 id="recent-events">Recent Events</h3>

<p>The activism and riots in the aftermath of the George Floyd incident in Minneapolis were the result of video taken from onlookers, after Floyd was on the ground. The video is graphic, but it also lacks the context of everything that happened up to that point. The prosecutor refused to release the actual body camera footage, until it was eventually leaked by the Daily Mail on August 3rd, 2020<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14">7</a></sup>. Eventually, a country judge ordered that the full footage be released.</p>

<p>Floyd is a highly polarizing case, and I’m not going to make any comments on it, other than that I suggest you watch the full body camera footage from the incident. There are several videos, one fifteen minutes in length from the perspective of Officer Tou Thao, and another from the body cameras of Officers Thomas Lane and J. Kueng, that is an hour in length<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>No matter what your current opinion is of the incident, if you haven’t seen them, you really need to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gQYMBALDXc">the full body camera videos</a> in entirety. They paint a drastically different narrative that the one that’s been fed to the world by the major media networks. The fact that the prosecutors withheld this evidence is nothing short of pure media manipulation.</p>

<h3 id="activists">Activists</h3>

<p>Carey Wedler is an activist who I have a lot of respect for. In 2018, she put out a video describing an incident where police raided the house of an activist she was staying with. The police entered while she was in the shower. She quickly jumped out and dressed, only to be detained with everyone in the house. She was on her period, and repeatedly asked to use the bathroom. Assured a female police officer was on the way, she waited for hours as she bled on herself. The female officer who arrived, gave her advice on how to get the blood out of her skirt. Despite all of this, she made a video about why she doesn’t harbor hatred for police over this incident.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…I don’t buy into the myth of the violent war on cops, because the statistics prove it’s not real. And I know that, while police advocates shun the problem of unarmed people getting killed, there are countless more who are beaten and maimed. But what I also now believe is that demonizing police at every turn hasn’t stopped the wave of police violence and killings. However much I disagree with the tactics, the authority and the institution, it remains that many of these officers are acting with good intentions. They may be enforcing injustices, but because of wide spread societal programming that obeying authority is good, they think they’re doing good deeds. It’s not their fault this was driven into them, or anyone else. Many cops actually do want to help others and keep them safe, even if the laws they’re enforcing make the problems worse and increase crime…” -Carey Wedler<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In her video, Wedler carefully navigates the waters of opposing submission to authority, while also warning her audience of the risks of dehumanizing police. The cry of protesters with catchphrases like <em>“All Cops are Bastards”</em>, creates a new <em>other</em> and a way to rationalize violence towards another group of human beings by removing our collective humanity.</p>

<h3 id="disbanding-the-police">Disbanding the Police</h3>

<p>In the wake of George Floyd, there have been continual calls to disband entire police departments. America has disbanded a police force once before, in 2003 under the government of George W. Bush, in a place called Baghdad. An immediate disbanding of police, without any foresight into reconstruction, led to massive looting, violence, and the emergence of warlords creating their own structures of control<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">10</a></sup>, not entirely unlike the region of <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/video/chaz-seattle-and-the-mob/">CHAZ</a> in Seattle, except at a considerably larger scale.</p>

<p>Supporters of disbanding will often bring up Camden, New Jersey, where the municipal police force was disbanded in 2012. But Camden wasn’t a situation where the police force was dismissed without forethought. Instead, a regional police department was formed, with funds and personnel being transferred into the new organization<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">11</a></sup>. There was a plan, and a clear path forward, which maintained police presence during the transition.</p>

<p>The wording has changed in some media from <em>disbanding</em> to <em>defunding</em> the police, with an emphasis on moving funds from the police into other community programs. However, cutting funds works at cross purposes with changes that would increase police accountability. Many departments lack the money to purchase body cameras<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">12</a></sup>. One might argue that cutting funding would force departments to move money away from military grade equipment, but most of that equipment isn’t paid for by municipalities. It comes from the Federal Government via the 1033 Program implemented under George H. W. Bush<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">13</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In Texas, the city of Austin voted to cut $150 million, nearly a third, of their police budget<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">14</a></sup>. The mayor of Seattle vetoed $4 million in cuts to her own police department, but the city’s Police Chief, Carmen Best, still resigned as she faced a nearly $20,000 cut to her income<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">15</a></sup>. It’s already difficult for police departments to afford good training and personnel, and I do not see these proposed cuts ending well.</p>

<h3 id="police-are-human-beings">Police are Human Beings</h3>

<p>When I was in my twenties, one of my best friends said that he wanted to run for public office. He mentioned how he’d run on a message of needing fewer police, and how it would lead us to be safer. A younger me believed in this hardliner, …</p></article></section></div></div>

<h2>System of Systems for Business and Startup Management for Companies with &lt;50 Employees</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="406" height="235" src="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image.png 406w, https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px"></figure>



<h2>ABOUT </h2>



<p>Every small business has to solve many of the same problems such as:</p>



<ul><li>“How do I hire great people?”</li><li>“How do I run a board of directors?” </li><li>“How do I measure personality traits?”</li><li>“How do I run team meetings?”</li><li><span>“How do I measure employee happiness?”</span></li><li>“How do I do vision, strategy and planning?”</li></ul>



<p>I spent the last three years choosing the best-of-the-best systems for the most common business challenges. </p>



<p>The result is this “system of systems” I call “The Playbook.” </p>



<h2>DESIGN GOALS</h2>



<p> •    <strong>Highest Impact.</strong> It’s the 20% of activities in operating a business that provides 80% of the results. This playbook should focus on those items.</p>



<p>  •    <strong>Self-Implementation.</strong> At this size of the company, consultants to implement these systems are not possible. </p>



<p>•    <strong>Tactical over Theoretical.</strong> Business books are usually at a concept-level. This makes sense because concepts don’t change. The tactics do change. So, we focus on systems that are actionable and tactical.</p>



<p> •    <strong>Bare Minimum.</strong> If a system isn’t essential, cut it out. Time is in the shortest supply as business leaders and anything that unnecessarily takes that has got to go.</p>



<h2>“THE PLAYBOOK”</h2>



<p>These are the best-of-breed system for each common business challenge.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="230" src="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1.png 590w, https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"></figure>



<p>Each subsequent section will speak to each of these systems.</p>



<p>We’ll conclude with a guide for implementation.</p>



<h2>EOS (“ENTREPRENEURIAL OPERATING SYSTEM”) </h2>



<p><strong><em>Solving for coordination as a team grows.</em></strong></p>



<p>Traction is the name of a book by Gino Wickman written to describe his concept of an “Entrepreneurial Operating System” (EOS). </p>



<p>The system is a combination of principles, templates and habits deployed inside of businesses to solve for common issues that occur as a business matures. It can be deployed as early as the inception of the business.</p>



<p>The book can be found here:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are several ways to implement the system. Some
founders self-implement and others leverage outside consultants certified by
the author. Both can work. In smaller companies, self-implementing is usually
the best since it is much cheaper.</p>



<p>The book does a great job of making this point, but I want
to reiterate it here: It takes time to implement all of these habits. A common
mistake is CEOs think they need to get it all deployed in a few weeks. The
reality is an established operating company can take years to deploy the
system.</p>



<p>There are other systems in existence. I prefer this one because it’s simpler to self-implement. As companies grow, they can graduate to deploy some of the more intensive systems like Scaling Up.</p>



<h2>CULTURE INDEX</h2>



<p>An assessment system that recognizes each person is
different with different strengths.</p>



<p>As we see in “First, Break All the Rules” in the section on
Managing People, the best managers deploy their staff to best use their
strengths. But, how do you develop a language to discuss those abilities?</p>



<p>Culture Index is a system that is used to do just that.</p>



<p>It’s a paid tool and the most expensive item of everything here in the Playbook:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cultureindex.com/">https://www.cultureindex.com/</a></p>



<h2>TOPGRADING</h2>



<p><strong><em>A system for finding “A-Players”</em></strong></p>



<p>Topgrading defines an “A-Player” as a performer in the top 10% of their pay band and role. We all want to hire those “Rock Stars.” But how?</p>



<p>The system has two core hypothesis about A-Players:<br> •    They have a track record of success.<br> •    They have tons of people in their history who will say great things about them.</p>



<p> Unfortunately, the Topgrading book is one of those business texts that has amazing ideas but is horribly written.  You can buy a copy here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Topgrading-3rd-Promoting-Turbocharges-Performance/">https://www.amazon.com/Topgrading-3rd-Promoting-Turbocharges-Performance/</a></p>



<p>Dr. Smart has passed away since publishing the book. His son has continued working in this space and published a book called “Who?” that is widely liked by many people. I dislike this book because it gives up on several of the ideas at the core of Topgrading.</p>



<p>In using Topgrading, I recommend each company adapt the comprehensive process that Dr. Smart describes. It is not universal and you do not need to use the entire thing to get the benefit of it.</p>



<h2>STORYBRAND</h2>



<p><strong><em>How to craft a story that resonates with customers</em></strong></p>



<p>What EOS/Traction is for operating a business, StoryBrand is that for marketing. It uses a set of templates, rules, and procedures to help a business deploy a useful narrative that resonates with customers.</p>



<p>Where this book shines is that it is a concrete set of steps for even a novice marketer to follow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It is centered around the idea that every good marketing system is based on the “Hero’s Journey.” Your business is the “yoda” that helps your customers become heroes.</p>



<h2>NET PROMOTER SCORE (NPS)</h2>



<p><strong><em>The one question to track your customer satisfaction and the health of your company.</em></strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been asked, “How likely are you to recommend this service to a friend or colleague?” at the end of a customer service interaction then you’re familiar with Net Promoter Score (NPS).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>NPS is a great way to measure the number of fans (aka “promoters”) versus detractors. Promoters are great because they tell all their friends how great you are. </p>



<p>There are multiple ways to implement NPS. My favorite is a <a href="http://geekdomfund.com/">Geekdom Fund </a>portfolio company called <a href="http://promoter.io/">Promoter.io</a>.</p>







<p><strong><em>Measure Employee Engagement</em></strong></p>



<p>We all know that the hierarchical structure for organizations
isn’t perfect, but it’s better than all the other options out there. </p>



<p>The main downside of a rigid hierarchy is limited information for you as a CEO or business owner as to what’s happening with your employees and their engagement. And we know highly engaged employees are more likely to be high performers.</p>



<p>Ideally, we want to quantify engagement. My favorite tool for this is the Q12 tool:</p>



<p><a href="https://q12.gallup.com/public/en-us/Features">https://q12.gallup.com/public/en-us/Features</a></p>



<h2>MG BOARD GOVERNANCE </h2>



<p><strong><em>Lightweight, effective small company board system.</em></strong></p>



<p>I have not found a complete, solid board governance system so I created my own. Note that this system assumes a company has or is in the process of implementing the EOS framework. </p>



<p>I’m in the process of publishing this online soon.</p>



<h2>IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE</h2>



<p>I recommend rolling out this in the following manner:  Focus on EOS first. The rest will follow.</p>



<p>By the time a company reaches more than the founding team, the EOS framework has the greatest impact on the operations. Note that a full EOS rollout into an existing operating company can take up to two years. So, patience and persistence are key.</p>



<p>As needed, implement the other systems depending on the situation of the business. If, for example, hiring has been a challenge then consider Topgrading. If there are talent fit issues once people have been hired, consider Culture Index next. And so on.</p>



<h2>FEEDBACK</h2>



<p>Do you have systems that are essential and work for your small business or startup? </p>



<p>I’d love to hear about them: email to Michael at the girdley.com or on twitter @mgirdley.</p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>The complexity of cloud costs keeps increasing - When we were building PlanForCloud in 2012 AWS had just hit 10,000 different pricing points for their services - now there are over 300,000.</p>
<p>We found existing tools fit in too late in the process and are not aimed at the people in control of the infrastructure. It’s difficult to get cost estimations when you are building and deploying your services, which often leads to bill shock and no easy way to track down these costs. So we wanted to build a CLI tool that can plug into your existing development and operations processes and bring cost visibility to the engineers.</p>
<p>Currently Infracost supports AWS and Terraform, but we will add support for more cloud vendors (GCP, Azure) and other IaC tools (Pulumi).</p>
<p>We also want to go beyond just the baseline costs of infrastructure - data transfer costs and other usage-based costs can often be a significant portion of a cloud bill, and are also the hardest to predict and track down. If you have any ideas about the best way to handle these then please <a href="https://twitter.com/aliscott" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reach out to me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Infracost is open source, you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/aliscott/infracost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/aliscott/infracost</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

<p>I like this as a metaphor for jelled teams. </p>



<p>In the neighborhood that is your team, are people borrowing cups of flour from each other? Are they carpooling to school? How much “hey neighbor, would you mind keeping an eye on my kids so I can run to the store?” is going on?</p>



<p>Replace cups of flour with, I dunno, pairing or rubber ducky debugging. Or swap babysitting the kids with babysitting a build. See where I’m going with this? </p>



<p>Is your team an old city neighborhood? Or is it just some people who happen to live in the same apartment block?</p>

<![CDATA[Creating a Video Streaming Server Using HLS]]>

September 4, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/04/golang-video-stream-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/04/golang-video-stream-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>In this tutorial, I’m going to walk you through building a Golang video streaming API (this works for other types of media as well!). Don’t worry, its surprisingly easy to build a robust media streaming server, especially if we utilize one of the more modern protocols, HLS.</p>



<h2>What is HLS?</h2>



<blockquote><p>HTTP Live Streaming is an HTTP-Based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol developed by Apple.</p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>HLS allows us to serve large media files as many smaller text files that are broken up into ~10-second increments. By breaking them up in this way, our user’s client-side app only needs to buffer 10 seconds in advance. This saves the user a lot of potential bandwidth and allows the song or video to start playback almost immediately.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFmpeg</a>, we can easily convert mp3 files to HLS format, which consists of multiple files. One of these files contains the metadata (.m3u8) and is served first. This metadata file tells the client where to get each data file, and what each data file contains. The data files have a .ts extension and typically contain ~10 seconds of audio and are served one-at-a-time at the client’s request.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-1024x499.jpeg" alt="FFmpeg" width="348" height="169" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-1024x499.jpeg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-300x146.jpeg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-768x374.jpeg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-100x49.jpeg 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-1200x585.jpeg 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" title="1 mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w"></figure></div>



<h2>Get Started – Format Some Media for your Server</h2>



<p>Download a sample .mp3:</p>



<p><a href="http://www.hubharp.com/web_sound/BachGavotteShort.mp3" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://www.hubharp.com/web_sound/BachGavotteShort.mp3</a></p>



<p>Install <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFmpeg</a>. If you are on a Mac:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">brew install ffmpeg</code></pre>



<p>Navigate to the directory of the mp3 file and run</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">ffmpeg -i BachGavotteShort.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k -map 0:0 -f segment -segment_time 10 -segment_list outputlist.m3u8 -segment_format mpegts output%03d.ts</code></pre>



<p>This should result in three new files:</p>



<pre>output000.ts output001.ts outputlist.m3u8</pre>



<p>Congratulations! You are done with the hard part, you now have simple files that can be served over HTTP. Any modern client-side media library will know how to read HLS files.</p>



<h2>Building the Streaming Server</h2>



<p>As I eluded to above, HLS is very simple on the server-side. All we need to do is serve a path to the .m3u8 file, and make sure the .ts files are served from the same path. In traditional file server architecture, this just means that they need to be in the same directory.</p>



<p>Let’s set up our project with the following folder structure:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="217" height="135" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-03-at-8.57.28-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 12 03 at 8.57.28 AM" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-03-at-8.57.28-AM.png 217w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-03-at-8.57.28-AM-100x62.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" title="Screen Shot 2019 12 03 at 8.57.28 AM"></figure></div>



<p>Copy the following code into main.go:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// configure the songs directory name and port
	const songsDir = "songs"
	const port = 8080

	// add a handler for the song files
	http.Handle("/", addHeaders(http.FileServer(http.Dir(songsDir))))
	fmt.Printf("Starting server on %v\n", port)
	log.Printf("Serving %s on HTTP port: %v\n", songsDir, port)

	// serve and log errors
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%v", port), nil))
}

// addHeaders will act as middleware to give us CORS support
func addHeaders(h http.Handler) http.HandlerFunc {
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
		h.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	}
}</code></pre>



<p>Now run your server:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">go run main.go</code></pre>



<p>Your server is live! Test your music play by using a media client. You can find a free online client here: <a href="https://hls-js-latest.netlify.com/demo/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://hls-js-latest.netlify.com/demo/</a></p>



<p>Simply paste your song’s URI and listen:</p>



<pre>http://localhost:8080/bachgavotteshort/outputlist.m3u8</pre>

<p>I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn't seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find!  That's when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests?  I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what I did over the past month!  I'm pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I've ever experienced.  I've discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also <em>why the code works the way it does</em>, and to explore edge cases while writing tests.  Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible!  It turns out the library I choose, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is a library on top of which many <a href="https://github.com/fastai">fast.ai</a> projects are built on. Most importantly, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I'm going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:</strong>  I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages.</li>
<li><strong>You get a new set of pragmatic tools</strong>: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.</li>
<li><strong>Learn more about the Python programming language:</strong>  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention.</p>

</div>
</div>

<hr>
<h2 id="Making-**kwargs-transparent">Making **kwargs transparent<a href="#Making-**kwargs-transparent"> </a></h2><p>Whenever I see a function that has the argument <strong>**kwargs</strong>, I cringe a little.  This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that <code>foo</code> also accepts and additional parameters <code>b</code> and <code>d</code>.  We can fix this with <code>delegates</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can customize the behavior of this decorator.  For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping <code>**kwargs</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude arguments.  For example, we exclude argument <code>d</code> from delegation:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also delegate between classes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes">Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes<a href="#Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes"> </a></h2><p>Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in <code>__init__</code>?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Ouch! That was painful.  Look at all the repeated variable names.  Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class?  Not Anymore!  Checkout <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">store_attr</a>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude certain attributes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>There are many more ways of customizing and using <code>store_attr</code> than I highlighted here.  Check out <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">the docs</a> for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate">Avoiding subclassing boilerplate<a href="#Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate"> </a></h2><p>One thing I hate about python is the <code>__super__().__init__()</code> boilerplate associated with subclassing.  For example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#PrePostInitMeta">PrePostInitMeta</a>.  We define a new class called <code>NewParent</code> that is a wrapper around the <code>ParentClass</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>

<h2 id="Type-Dispatch">Type Dispatch<a href="#Type-Dispatch"> </a></h2><p>Type dispatch, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">Multiple dispatch</a>, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives.  This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia.  For example, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">conceptual example</a> of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting spaceship</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting spaceship</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box.  Fortunately, there is the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html#typedispatch-Decorator">@typedispatch</a> decorator to the rescue.  This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function <code>f</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html">you can read about here</a>. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch">multipledispatch</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin">Mathhew Rocklin</a> (the creator of Dask).</p>
<p>After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p><code>functools.partial</code> is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= <code>val</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can create a new function out of this function using <code>partial</code> that sets the default value to 5:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One problem with <code>partial</code> is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Composition-of-functions">Composition of functions<a href="#Composition-of-functions"> </a></h2><p>A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result.  This is especially useful when applying various data transformations.  Consider a toy example where I have three functions:  (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>But why is this useful?  You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>arrsum</span><span>(</span><span>add2</span><span>(</span><span>filter5</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>])))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You are not wrong!  However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>For more information about <code>compose</code>, read <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#compose">the docs</a>.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="A-more-useful-__repr__">A more useful <code>__repr__</code><a href="#A-more-useful-__repr__"> </a></h2><p>In python, <code>__repr__</code> helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging.  Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using <code>store_attr</code>, which was discussed earlier).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can use <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#basic_repr">basic_repr</a> to quickly give us a more sensible default:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator">Monkey Patching With A Decorator<a href="#Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator"> </a></h2><p>It can be convenient to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/">monkey patch</a> with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing.  We can use the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#patch">decorator @patch</a> from <code>fastcore.foundation</code> along with type hints like so:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now, <code>MyClass</code> has an additional method named <code>func</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Still not convinced?  I'll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>

<h2 id="A-better-pathlib.Path">A better pathlib.Path<a href="#A-better-pathlib.Path"> </a></h2><p>When you see <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">these extensions</a> to pathlib.path you won't ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Path.readlines</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.readlines()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.read</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.read()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.save</code>: saves file as pickle</li>
<li><code>Path.load</code>: loads pickle file</li>
<li><code>Path.ls</code>: shows the contents of the path as a list. </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">Read more about this here</a>.  Here is a demonstration of <code>ls</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Wait!  What's going on here?  We just imported <code>pathlib.Path</code> - why are we getting this new functionality?  Thats because we imported the <code>fastcore.foundation</code> module, which patches this module via the <code>@patch</code> decorator discussed earlier.  Just to drive the point home on why the <code>@patch</code> decorator is useful, I'll go ahead and add another method to <code>Path</code> right now:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>That is magical, right?  I know!  That's why I'm writing about it!</p>
</div>

<h2 id="An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas">An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas<a href="#An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas"> </a></h2><p><code>Self</code>, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object.  For example, let's create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can use <code>Self</code> in the same way:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Let's create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Notebook-Functions">Notebook Functions<a href="#Notebook-Functions"> </a></h2><p>These are simple but handy, and allow you to know whether or not code is executing in a Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or an Ipython Shell:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="A-Drop-In-Replacement-For-List">A Drop-In Replacement For List<a href="#A-Drop-In-Replacement-For-List"> </a></h2><p>You might be pretty happy with Python's <code>list</code>.  This is one of those situations that you don't know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you.  Enter <code>L</code>, a list like object with many extra goodies.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe <code>L</code> is to pretend that <code>list</code> and <code>numpy</code> had a pretty baby:</p>

September 4, 2020 | https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The above QR code contains a complete Windows executable that will run on Windows 7 and up. It's a simple but fully playable implementation of Snake.</p>
<p>A QR code is a data storage medium like any other, and while it's almost always used to store ASCII text, it can also be used to store binary data. As such, virtually any computer data can theoretically be stored in a QR code provided it can fit within the size limitations.</p>
<p>A QR code comes in various standard sizes, the largest being version 40 which can store up to 2,953 bytes (roughly 2.9 KB) of binary data. The above code is not quite that large, it's only storing around 1.4 KB of data (shrunk down from 3.2 KB with <a href="http://www.crinkler.net/" target="_blank">Crinkler</a>, slightly larger than the executable shown in the video because I decided to add a little more functionality).</p>

<p><b>Method 1: Webcam (automatic)</b></p>
<p>You can treat this QR code much like a QR code in the real world by using your computer's webcam to read it (e.g. after loading this page on a phone or printing the QR code out). For this, I recommend using zbarcam. I've included a download link with everything you need:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open "Read Snake From QR.bat". After a moment, your webcam will activate.</li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and Snake will appear, freshly read from the QR code.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Method 2: Webcam (manual)</b></p>
<p>This method is the same as the above, however if you'd rather input the commands manually than running my script, go for it:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
    <li><span>cd</span> to the zbarcam folder.</li>
    <li>Run the following command:
        <p>zbarcam --raw --oneshot -Sbinary &gt; snake.exe</p>
        <p>The arguments used are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>--raw</span> - Disables any character encoding conversion.</li>
            <li><span>--oneshot</span> - Stops reading and closes zbarcam after the code has been successfully read.</li>
            <li><span>-Sbinary</span> - Informs zbarcam that the data in the code is binary data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and an executable called "snake.exe" will appear in the same folder.</li>
    <li>Open "snake.exe".</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been patched to correctly output binary data on Windows. This project exposed a bug in zbarcam where binary data was incorrectly treated as text, inadvertently corrupting it as Windows attempted to convert LF line endings to CRLF. The fix used here has since been merged into zbar's master source code, but as of July 2020 no stable release version has included the fix yet.</li>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been compiled with DirectShow support for greater compatibility with webcam devices. In my video, I use a build that has not been compiled for DirectShow (using VfW instead) which leads to a black and white webcam feed. This build provides a feed in color.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote an implementation of Snake in JavaScript that, when minified, could also fit into the maximum QR code size which I briefly showcased in the video. Some people were interested in playing this, so <a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/snake-minified.html">it is available here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h3 id="if-not-please-continue-reading"><strong>If not please continue reading. 😊</strong></h3>
<p>My first introduction to programming was with the programming langauge Java, and one of the concepts of programming with Java was Object Oriented Programming (OOP). For short, this concept <strong>encourages developers to code</strong> their software in a way that tries <strong>to model real life objects</strong>, so that </p>
<ul>
<li>Different components of your software can be represented well and</li>
<li>Features of similar concerns can be grouped together.</li>
</ul>
<p>To read more on this concept check out <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS">here</a></p>
<p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm langauge, meaning it does not enforce any programming concepts unlike langauges like Java. This is not neccesarily a bad thing, it just means we can incoporate some Object Oriented Programming goodness into writing our JavaScript code. </p>
<p><strong>In this write up we would be practicing this while creating a Student Registry Form.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We would be using ES6 classes to demonstrate our example. JavaScript ES5 has a different approach using prototypes, but I find ES6 classes simpler and easier to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I move to the implementation we should look at the meaning of some keywords in object oriented programming. </p>
<h2 id="instantiating-classes">Instantiating classes</h2>
<p>In the OOP world when a class is Instantiated it means an object with unique/shared properties has been created. <strong>So for example </strong></p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Student</span> {}




<span>const</span> student1 = <span>new</span> Student();


</code></pre><h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>
<p>These encapsulate the properties you would like to create every object with, and <strong>in JavaScript we do it like so</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> Student {
    <span>constructor</span>(<span>name, email, address, course</span>){
        <span>this</span>.name = name;
        <span>this</span>.email = email;
        <span>this</span>.address = address;
                <span>this</span>.course = course;
    }
}



<span>const</span> student1 = <span>new</span> Student(<span>'Tayo'</span>, <span>'tayo@gmail.com'</span>, <span>'56 Mongromery House m7 780'</span>, <span>'Social Science'</span>);
<span>const</span> student2 = <span>new</span> Student(<span>'Peter'</span>, <span>'peter@hotmail.com'</span>, <span>'12 Grunt Road m6 100'</span>, <span>'Nursing'</span>);

<span>console</span>.log(student1)
<span>console</span>.log(student2)


</code></pre><h2 id="methods-in-classes">Methods in classes</h2>
<p>Classes can also contain methods that can be called on each object after intialisation. <strong>For example</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Student</span> </span>{
    <span>constructor</span>(name, email, address, course){
        <span>this</span>.name = name;
        <span>this</span>.email = email;
        <span>this</span>.address = address;
                <span>this</span>.course = course;
    }

    getName(){
        <span>return</span> `Student name <span>is</span> ${<span>this</span>.name}`
    }
}

<span>const</span> student2 = new Student(<span>'Peter'</span>, <span>'peter@hotmail.com'</span>, <span>'12 Grunt Road m6 100'</span>, <span>'Nursing'</span>);

console.log(student2.getName()) 
</code></pre><h2 id="inheritance-extending-classes">Inheritance/ Extending classes</h2>
<p>Class inheritance is a common code practice where we have a super class that has similar properties or methods to its children classes, and then the children classes copy from their parent class. The child class can further extend its class functionality if need be. </p>
<p>Its just a neat way of making sure we are not repeating similar properties between multiple classes. Assuming that our class Student extends a parent class of Person. So we know a person can have a name, age and address but they might not have a course because they might not be students. <strong>We represent this like so</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> </span>{
    <span>constructor</span>(name, email, address){
        <span>this</span>.name = name;
        <span>this</span>.email = email;
        <span>this</span>.address = address;
    }

    getName(){
        <span>return</span> `Student name <span>is</span> ${<span>this</span>.name}`
    }
}

<span><span>class</span> <span>Student</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Person</span> </span>{
    <span>constructor</span>(name, email, address, course){
                <span>super</span>(name, email, address);
                <span>this</span>.course = course;
    }
}

    <span>const</span> student2 = new Student(<span>'Hannah'</span>, <span>'hannah@hotmail.com'</span>, <span>'1 Medley m3 493'</span>, <span>'Economics'</span>);

console.log(student2.getName()) 
</code></pre><p>Inheritance allows the children objects to inherit all its parents properties and methods. In this case the Student class has inherited the propertied form name, age and address as well as method getName(). You can also add more methods or properties to the Student class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Student can access properties from Person but not the other way round.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="practical-example-oop-practice-using-javascript">Practical Example - OOP Practice using JavaScript</h2>
<p>Remember I said with OOP we try to represent things as objects, and those objects normally have functions, properties etc that represents the object's functionality? So in this case we would have two objects to build the <strong>Student Registry app</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Student Object  - Which stores data about the student information like name, email, address etc</li>
<li>UI Object - This object will be responsible for handling any changes in the the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what our student registry form looks like and the class objects that represents the students and the ui</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599081166433/_GgmwA20h.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Here we have constructed a <strong>Student class</strong> which will take in the values from our form to be rendered in the table below the form. Lets take a look at how we would do this using classes in JavaScript</p>
<pre><code>
<span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'student-form'</span>).addEventListener(<span>'submit'</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>e</span>)</span>{

    <span>const</span> name = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'name'</span>).value;
          email = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'email'</span>).value;
          address = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'address'</span>).value;
          course = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'course'</span>).value;

    
    <span>const</span> student = <span>new</span> Student(name, email, address, course);

    
    <span>const</span> ui = <span>new</span> UI();

    
    <span>if</span>(name === <span>''</span> || email === <span>''</span> || address === <span>''</span> || course === <span>''</span>){
        ui.showAlert(<span>'Please fill in all fields'</span>, <span>'error'</span>)
    }<span>else</span>{
        ui.addStudentToList(student);
        ui.clearFields();
        ui.showAlert(<span>"Student added"</span>, <span>"success"</span>)
    }

    e.preventDefault();
})
</code></pre><p>In the code above we have - </p>
<ul>
<li>Added an event listener to the form for student registry</li>
<li>Once the form is submitted we would like to store the input values for name, email, address and course in variables as shown.</li>
<li>Once the values are retrieve we can then <strong>instantiate</strong> our student class with the values.</li>
<li>We also <strong>initialised</strong> our UI class</li>
<li>The instance of the UI class we created allows us to call some of its functionality like <strong>showAlert, addStudentToList and clearFields.</strong></li>
<li>If the input fields are empty an appropriate ui function is called, else if everything is valid then we can add the student to the list, clear the input fields and show a success alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets look at the implementation for these methods</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>class</span> <span>UI</span> </span>{

    
    addStudentToList(student){

        <span>const</span> list = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'student-list'</span>);
        
        <span>const</span> row = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'tr'</span>);
        
        row.innerHTML = <span>`
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.name}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.email}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.address}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.course}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="delete"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        `</span>;

        list.appendChild(row);

    }

}
</code></pre><p>Our first method in the class is <strong>addStudentToList</strong> here we </p>
<ul>
<li>accept the student object as an argument</li>
<li>Select the table body element using <strong>getElementById</strong></li>
<li>Then create a tr element</li>
<li>Then we insert our HTML in the tr element we just created and then access each of the Student class properties we would like to display.</li>
<li>After this the row is appended to the table body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great we can add the second method of concern to our UI class which is the clearField method</p>
<pre><code>    clearFields(){
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'name'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'email'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'address'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'course'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
    }

} 
</code></pre><p>This is a simple function that just sets the input field in the form to nothing once the form is submitted.</p>
<p>And finally the last <strong>showAlert</strong> which takes in two parameters the first one the alert message and the second argument is the name of the class.</p>
<pre><code>    showAlert(message, className){

            <span>const</span> div = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'div'</span>);
            div.className = <span>`alert <span>${className}</span>`</span>;
            div.appendChild(<span>document</span>.createTextNode(message));

            
            <span>const</span> container = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'.container'</span>);

            <span>const</span> form = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'student-form'</span>);

            container.insertBefore(div, form);
            setTimeout(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
                <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'.alert'</span>).remove();
            }, <span>3000</span>);

    }
} 
</code></pre><p><strong>In this function </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A div is created and classnames alert and the classname passed is added to it</li>
<li>A text node is created with the message passed</li>
<li>Both the container and the form is selected to guide where the alert message should be inserted</li>
<li>And in this case we want to insert the div we created just between the form and the container div.</li>
<li>After 3 seconds the alert bar is removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a brilliant way to write your code because it makes everything more resuable. Can you add a delete method to our ui class? Give it a shot. You would need knowledge on targetting elements to be deleted written <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.oshogunle.com/learning-javascript-topic-event-bubbling-and-delegation-cke03qfaw0003u0s17oppa0uz">here</a></p>
<p>To test our code so far the output looks like so. </p>

<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.48-AM.jpg" alt="Sibros, Hemant Sikaria, OTA vehicle software updates, vehicle data security, Tesla, open-source vehicle security, remote vehicle software updates" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.48-AM.jpg 699w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.48-AM-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></figure>



<p>Passenger cars and trucks have become rolling software updates, and while that has sped up product development cycles, it has created a big problem. A lot of the automotive industry has been updating software post vehicle sale through dealership recalls. As you can imagine, with dozens of systems using different software in a single car, that could become an issue. Enter remote software updates, an increasingly common strategy for mobility tech to integrate continuously improving software into vehicles that have already been set on the road. </p>



<p>Tesla was a pioneer in this field. In a way, a new EV startup was the perfect place for something like remote vehicle software updates to take off, because Tesla was building mostly from the ground up. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1024x430.png" alt="Sibros, Hemant Sikaria, OTA vehicle software updates, vehicle data security, Tesla, open-source vehicle security, remote vehicle software updates" width="269" height="113" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1024x430.png 1024w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-300x126.png 300w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-768x322.png 768w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1536x645.png 1536w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-2048x860.png 2048w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1200x504.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px"></figure></div>



<p>Hemant Sikaria joined Tesla back in 2011 as a technical engineering lead, and helped build a large portion of the software update platform Tesla still uses. He also led the body and chassis teams. “There is a lot software that connects with the windows, trunk, key fob,” he explains. Sikaria was technical lead on the Model X as well, and worked with the Tesla team on the Model X self-opening front doors. But then, he had his non-Tesla personal vehicle called to the dealership several times within 3 months for a recall and software update, and realized that most of the automotive industry wasn’t using the Tesla method of OTA or “over the air” software updates. “I got the startup itch,” Sikaria says, and he started tech startup <a href="https://www.sibros.tech/">Sibros</a> in 2018 to bring OTA software updates to the rest of the automotive industry.</p>



<p>It’s not so easy to be accepted into a gigantic, established, closed-door industry like automotive, much less integrate rapidly changing software technology with a years-long vehicle product development cycle. But the background in automotive at Tesla made all the difference in “knowing the pain points,” Sikaria says. Sibros partnered with an open-source security company in Silicon Valley to create a system with multiple layers of security for vehicle data collection and software updates. </p>



<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.09-AM.jpg" alt="Sibros, Hemant Sikaria, OTA vehicle software updates, vehicle data security, Tesla, open-source vehicle security, remote vehicle software updates" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.09-AM.jpg 670w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.09-AM-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"></figure>



<p>“We focused on building the core platform that every automaker will need,” Sikaria says when asked how one untangles the problem of integrating with so many diverse legacy software systems developed by automakers. The Sibros system can perform software updates for the full vehicle–up to 80 microcontrollers–for a full deep update of the vehicle. This can be the difference between a vehicle needing to be brought into the dealership to improve its self-driving algorithms for improved safety versus having them delivered to the car in real-time with no inconvenience. There are multiple ways vehicles require these updates these days, from infotainment map updates to hardware functions in the vehicle. “We have the fastest integration on the vehicle side–6 days,” Sikaria says. He says when he tried to explain that to automotive industry folks, they didn’t believe it was possible to do in under a month. “We developed our system in a modular way to integrate with vehicle hardware and back-end systems,” Sikaria explains. “It’s configurable for different networks and hardware architecture.” </p>



<p>Sikaria says the biggest change he’s seeing in mobility tech right now is that people are taking connectivity in vehicles more seriously. “COVID accelerated the use of remote diagnostics, telemetry, and software updates,” he explains. “We’re seeing interest in our remote systems in Germany, the U.S., China, and Japan.” </p>



<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.31-AM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.31-AM.jpg 670w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.31-AM-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"></figure>



<p>As any Detroit automotive engineer or entrepreneur can tell you, this is not all as easy as Sikaria is making it sound. Legacy culture as well as software at automakers can create lags in production cycles that create problems for software development and updates integrating with other systems as software technology changes practically by the day, though the situation is improving. We asked Sikaria if he has any advice for entrepreneurs breaking into mobility tech. “Anybody looking to solve problems first needs to understand ‘what are the real problems?'” he says. “Test all assumptions. What are your top 3-5 assumptions on which you’re basing your new company? And test those assumptions before you do much product build.”</p>



<p>Also, Sikaria says that industry experience is invaluable. “If folks have a chance to work in the industry before starting their entrepreneurial journey, that gives you first-hand experience of reality versus what media are saying the state of the industry is,” Sikaria says. A smaller mobility company like <a href="https://cronicle.press/2020/03/06/may-mobility-the-autonomous-transportation-revolution/">May Mobility</a>, Sikaria says, or new startup Rivian, would be a good place to gain a lot of experience and wear many hats quickly to get up to speed on the industry. </p>

<p>It’s difficult for entrepreneurs whether they’re in the hardware or software space in mobility, Sikaria says. “Hardware startups need to raise a lot of money,” he says. “Software is easier from a financial perspective but competitive because the barrier to entry is lower. Software in automotive is hard to do without an automotive background. At Sibros we knew the technology, use cases, pain points. That could be difficult without an automotive background.” </p>



<p>And the biggest problem? No surprise here: awareness. “This is a product everybody needs,” Sikaria says, “but it can be hard to find the right people to connect with and socialize the idea.” </p>



<p>As product development cycles in automotive shrink and software rollouts become a continuous rollout, we’re hoping to hear more good news from Detroit and from Silicon Valley tech companies making this a smoother process for both engineers and end consumers. No doubt it is a fascinatingly complex process, and any company making it easier deserves some credit for the sheer complexity of what they’re making seamless in your car. </p>

                <p>I'm stepping down from Rust's core team. It's my last official involvement with Rust, and I'm kinda sad about leaving. Rust is exciting and important, and I love the community and technology. It has been a joy and an education to work with the core team; they are good people.</p><p>I stopped working full-time on Rust early in 2019 when I left Mozilla. I have been contributing as part of my work at PingCAP (big thank you for that support!) and in my own time, but have had much less time for the work than it deserves. My wife and I are expecting a second daughter any day now, and I think that will nuke my remaining spare time, and any availability I have left for Rust work. Good timing for me to make space on the core team, and to focus on my databases/distributed systems work.</p><p>I hope to remain active in the community, and hopefully next year, once things have settled down a bit at home, I can again contribute regularly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/content/images/2020/09/99312bc3-a432-415b-8366-9ad1eefd47bb.JPG" alt="Ultrasound image of my daughter"><figcaption>My next project, pre-launch</figcaption></figure>

<p>When we talk about container runtime, we immediately think about Docker. Docker was the original container runtime; at the very least, it was the runtime that triggered the cloud boom that we are experiencing today. Docker allows virtualization to be far more robust and scalable by running containers and freeing developers from conventional cloud infrastructure limitations.</p>



<p>Docker also allows for the entire cloud architecture to be managed in a seamless way. It automates a lot of things about deploying cloud-native applications, from configuring the shared operating system components to making it straightforward for developers to package applications with all of its dependencies and libraries for smooth and universal deployment.</p>



<p>Docker, however, is a container runtime, which means it is complex by nature. To stay true to its mission to simplify cloud architecture management, Docker started separating components and functions. Containerd was introduced in Docker 1.11, and the container runtime⁠—or container tool, to be precise—has now matured to stand on its own.</p>



<h2>Getting to Know Containerd</h2>



<p>As mentioned before, Containerd started life as a tool that is a part of the Docker open source project. Containerd works really well with components such Kubelet. In fact, Containerd handles image management and worked alongside runc to construct the container runtime that we are so used to using.</p>



<p>Containerd, however, has graduated into its own high-level container runtime. On February 28, 2019, Containerd graduated as a project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which placed this tool alongside Kubernetes, CoreDNS, and Prometheus. The support of thousands of developers behind Containerd made it possible.</p>



<p>As a high-level container runtime, Containerd no longer requires Docker to run properly. It can now run on its own, with runc being its low-level container runtime. When used to deploy and manage Kubernetes, you can see Containerd as replacing Docker and Docker-shim with CRI-Containerd. Containerd has a few tricks up its sleeve too.</p>



<p>For starters, the high-level runtime is compatible with other low-level runtimes. You are not limited to using runc as your container runtime. You can also opt for tools such as kata-runtime to run containers. Containerd even supports running multiple container runtimes within the same environment.</p>



<p>Containerd works with both Linux and Windows and can handle on-premise and cloud hardware without a problem. Since Containerd completely abstracts syscalls or OS specific functionality, it is the perfect solution for running containers on top of any OSes it supports. Everything, from service discovery to netlink calls, is made simple.</p>



<h2>What Makes Containerd Different</h2>



<p>To really understand how Containerd has become an efficient tool and a capable container runtime that it is, we have to compare it against Docker. While Docker offers additional features through multiple components, Containerd is now a tool that specializes in three things: running images in containers, pushing and pulling images to the registry, and managing the images themselves.</p>



<p>Docker, on the other hand, handles building images and creating volumes. It also takes care of network plugins and overlay networks. Containerd simply abstracts all of those functionalities away, resulting in a very simple container runtime that gets you to the state that you want faster.</p>



<p>Containerd does offer some advantages. Since containers are almost entirely independent, you can upgrade and reboot the Docker daemon without restarting containers or bringing them down. The API offered by Containerd also makes managing the environment using Containerd a lot easier. You basically have control over everything through API calls.</p>



<p>Not having to work with syscalls is a benefit of its own. Also, the presence of runc is so that Containerd can still run Linux commands and processes, mainly for the purpose of supporting the containers running on top of it.</p>



<h2>Complete Container Lifecycle Management</h2>



<p>OCI image spec support and OCI runtime spec support⁠—apparent from the use of runc⁠—both make Containerd straightforward to work with. You know immediately that you can manage the lifecycle of containers from end to end without having to integrate additional tools or gain access to features you don’t really need.</p>



<p>Support for image push and pull is a useful tool. Everything you can do with Containerd can be done in a simple way. For, example, pulling an image is a simple cli&nbsp;“$ ctr image pull”. </p>



<p>There are plenty of ways to optimize your use of Containerd too, starting with making sure that a minimalist host operating system is in use. Containerd doesn’t add bulk to the underlying operating system⁠—since it runs as a daemon⁠—but you can boost the performance of the overall cloud environment by optimizing the ecosystem from the ground up.</p>



<p>Your choice of container runtime (low-level) is also important. Runc runs containers for you by default, but there are other container runtimes to choose from. With the client layer supporting Docker or Kubernetes, you will never have to go into kernel details. With Kubernetes specifically, Containerd can also be used as CRI runtime.</p>



<p>What must not be forgotten is the additional projects that can enhance Containerd and the environment it supports further. Containerd has a distribution controller, bundle controller, and runtime controller. </p>



<p>It is clear that Containerd is set up this way so the tool can offer maximum scalability without making running apps and microservices in containers too complicated.</p>

			<h4><em>Dean Scarff</em> on bringing AI to climbing grades</h4>



<p>It’s some time in The Future; the bushfire smoke has cleared, you’re out of coronavirus lockdown and you’re psyched to finally climb outdoors again. Flicking through the guidebook you spot it; a climb that’s at your grade, and it’s even got two stars. The onsight awaits.</p>



<p>Several hours later you’re thrutching up a section of the route that feels like it must be at least two grades harder than what the guidebook claimed. The only hope for your ego is that you’re collateral damage from a 1970s interstate sandbagging contest. If only you could have stumbled on a recently-bolted softie that climbs like a gym route instead!</p>



<p>In Australia we’re blessed with the best grading system in the world courtesy of the legendary John Ewbank.&nbsp; Ewbank used whole number grades, which took into account a range of factors. These numbers put climbs in order: you can expect a grade 20 will be harder than a grade 19, and so on.</p>



<p>Yet even with this system, we rely on the opinions of first ascensionists and guidebook editors for fair grading. These opinions can be warped by grade inflation, quirky styles and intentional sandbagging. Another problem arises when trying to do maths with grade numbers. Normally we can add 1 to a whole number to get the next whole number, but there’s nothing consistent and measurable that’s equivalent to adding 1 to the grade of a route.</p>



<p>What if there was a way to quantify which routes were soft or sandbagged, some measure that reflected the experience of many climbers? Well, obviously you’d use it to find something soft to tick and impress your friends, right?!</p>



<h3><strong>FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine you’re seeking glory and wander into an unfamiliar crag without a guidebook. Your mate, who can redpoint most 19s but has been working several grade 21 projects for months, proceeds to flash a route.&nbsp; You guess it’s grade 19 or lower. If your mate dogged it instead, you might guess it’s above grade 19. The more climbers of different skill levels trying the route, the more information you have to pinpoint the grade.</p>



<p>But what if you don’t know how hard everyone else climbs to start with?&nbsp; That’s fine, you can watch for climbers who are taking roughly the same number of attempts as you to send particular routes. When it’s your turn on the next route, you can guess that you’ll take the same number of attempts as they did.</p>



<p>This is the basis for a scientific grading system. Instead of using people’s opinions about how hard routes are, you observe the actual outcomes of the ascents. To put a single number on how difficult a climb is, you can use the odds that you’ll send it.</p>



<h3><strong>THE CHESS GAME</strong></h3>



<p>Last year, on weekends I couldn’t climb, I investigated how far I could take these ideas. I drew inspiration from what may seem like a surprising source: the world of boardgame player ratings. Games like chess have ratings systems for ranking professional players, and I figured this could be applied to climbing.</p>



<p>These ratings systems are grounded in probability theory: the current ratings of two players can be used to calculate odds on the outcome of a game. The difference in ratings can be transformed to a probability using the ‘logistic function’, an S-shaped curve. If players have the same rating (0 difference), the odds are even. As the difference between the players’ ratings gets bigger, the probability the favourite wins gets closer to 100%. These systems allow for the ratings to be adjusted: after a game, the winner’s rating is adjusted up, and the loser’s rating is adjusted down.</p>

<p>I applied the same function for climbing. Every ascent is like a chess game, but one of the players is the rock itself. We can also make some other assumptions: it’s unlikely that climbers make big improvements overnight, and the longer it’s been since a climber has logged any climbing, the less certain we can be about their current performance level. All these statements about ‘what’s likely’ can be combined into a single statistical model. Based on this model, I built software that picks the best climber and route ratings to fit with a list of ticks.</p>



<p>All I needed now was data. To start with I just used my friends’ logbooks, which let me sanity-check the software I’d written. But with so many routes, the model needed more data to narrow down grades. So I made contact with <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="theCrag.com (opens in a new tab)">theCrag.com</a>, an online guidebook and logbook website. The team from theCrag gave me access to the hundreds of thousands of ascents records available from the platform, which I used to validate and refine the model.</p>



<p>We were stoked with the results of running theCrag’s users’ logbooks through my program. In most cases, the estimated grades are similar to guidebook grades, so the model is able to calculate a reasonable grade without anyone’s opinion as input. It’s also good at putting odds on clean ascents: adding 1 to a grade has a real meaning in terms of the odds someone can send a route. These are the theoretical improvements over conventional grading.</p>



<p>However, the real gold is where the model results and the guidebook disagree. For some routes, particularly rarely repeated ones, this seems to be due to a lack of data: the clean first ascent belies many hours of working a project. But in many cases climbers’ online accusations of soft or sandbagged grading were agreeing with the model. I’d found what I’d been looking for, and soon enough my friends were asking for recommendations of soft routes at the next grade.</p>



<p>There are still many opportunities for improvement. How good the estimated grades are depends a lot on the ascent data. Picking the right grades relies on climbers logging all their ascents online, even their hangdogs. And there are lots of other factors that are currently left out of the model to keep it simple, such as the effect of particular styles, reachy moves, knowing the beta and broken holds.</p>



<p>For me, working on this project was an opportunity to combine two of my hobbies (climbing and programming), while also making something for the climbing community. I’ve made the open source estimation software available for <a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings">fr</a><a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="e (opens in a new tab)">e</a><a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings">e</a>, and I’ve also published an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">academic paper</a> detailing the theory and performance of the model. I’m also very grateful for the willingness of Simon Dale and his team at theCrag.com to work together.</p>



<p>As for the revised grades, a first version of them <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/">has been</a><a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="  (opens in a new tab)"> </a><a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/">incorporated into route listings on theCrag.com</a> – you can see it listed amongst the Grade Citations under the name grAId (a play on the word ‘grade’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence’). </p>

  <section>
  

  

  <p><em>This article is part of an ongoing “<a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/posts/category-disassembling-links-awakening">Disassembling Link’s Awakening</a>” series, where I attempt to gain some understanding on how special effects were implemented in this game.</em></p>

<p>The Game Boy, as most gaming platforms at the time, uses tiles for graphics rendering. Instead of drawing individual pixels on the screens, games must first provide <em>tiles</em> (small graphics fragments, usually 8x8 pixels wide), and then combine together this limited number of tiles to draw pictures on the screen.</p>

<p>This technical limitation influences not only the games appearance, but also the gameplay. This articles goes in-depth into a specific example: how the design of Zelda: Link’s Awakening overworld map is influenced by the underlying tile-based rendering.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-of-tiles-based-rendering">Challenges of tiles-based rendering</h2>

<p>To display an image on screen, as all tile-based games, the game engine must first copy the required tiles to the Game Boy <abbr title="Video memory">VRAM</abbr>.</p>

<p>This brings two challenges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of tiles that can fit into VRAM at a given time is extremely limited,</li>
  <li>Changing the tiles stored in VRAM is slow, and can only be done at specific times.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>
<a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld_2.dmg.png"><img src="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld_2.dmg.png" alt="The tileset of Link's Awakening Overworld"></a>
<br>
<em>A part of the tileset used on the Overworld.<br>
This is way to big to fit all in memory at once, so only parts of it can be loaded at a time.</em>
</span></p>

<p>So in order to display graphics efficiently, great care must be given to the <strong>ressource-management of tiles</strong>.</p>

<p>A modern game engine would probably include a ressource-management system, which would ensure that, for each frame, the tiles required to display the objects on the screen are properly loaded. But the code for such a system would be quite complex: as uploading tiles takes a lot of time, it would have to predict which objects are going to appear on screen. The system would also have to ensure that not too many different objects are going to be visible on screen at once–otherwise there’s no space left in VRAM to upload the required tiles.</p>

<p>But on older hardware, such as the Game Boy, VRAM is so limited that every single tile must be put to use. There’s no margin left for predictive loading or fancy resource-management systems.</p>

<p>Instead, older games generally use <strong>tilesets</strong>. Tilesets are some fixed sets of tiles that are grouped together, and known to be predictable available at a given time. The game designers typically give each scene its own tileset, and then use a tile editor to draw the rendered frame. And the tilesets can be switched when the game transitions from one scene to another.</p>

<p>As of Link’s Awakening, the code responsible for this ressource management has recently been documented. And this is exactly how the game manages tiles. The world map is divided into sections of 2x2 rooms. Each section has an associated tileset, which allows the map feature some variety between the different sections (because they can use different tilesets).</p>

<p>An array is not very telling. Let’s use a picture instead! And we’re lucky, because a few years ago, <a href="https://xkeeper.net/">Xkeeper</a> generated a map of the Overworld with the tileset IDs overlaid on each section.</p>

<p><a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets.png"><img src="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Overworld map of Link's Awakening, with the tileset ID overlayed on each map section"></a>
<em>Each 2x2 section of the Overworld map declares its own tileset ID. (Credits: <a href="https://xkeeper.net/hacking/linksawakening/">Xkeeper</a>)</em></p>

<p>Quite simple – in theory.</p>

<h2 id="technical-constraints">Technical constraints</h2>

<p>Practically, it’s not so easy. As we know, in Link’s Awakening, when player moves from one room to another, the game animates the changes smoothly. Which means that during the transition, <strong>both the previous room and the next one are visible</strong>.</p>

<p>So during a room transition, both the old and new tileset need to be available in VRAM. Otherwise, glitches will ensue: if the tileset of the new room overlaps the tiles of the previous room, the previous room will shortly be rendered with incorrect tiles. Every time the game designers want to introduce new tiles, they have to think about the transitions from all the adjacent rooms. Moreover, this is hard to debug: the glitches could manifest only when visiting the rooms in a specific order.</p>

<p>Link’s Awakening engine has a solution for this: <strong>put structural constraints on the map design</strong> to avoid the issue almost entirely. Instead of testing every combination of rooms and tilesets, the game instead:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Defines a special “Keep current” tileset code,</li>
  <li>Ensures that the player always goes through a “Keep current” tileset before loading a new one.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “Keep current” tileset code is a special tileset ID, that instructs the game engine not to load any new tileset data for the current section of 2x2 rooms. You can spot it on the tilsets map above: it has a <code>0x0F</code> ID.</p>

<p>How does it solves our tileset issues? Well, a “Keep current” tileset is kind of a buffer zone between two different tilesets. A section with this tileset must be displayable using any of the tilesets of the section leading to it.</p>

<p>For instance, given the following map layout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> ——————————      ——————————————     ———————————
| Section 1 |   |  Section 2   |   | Section 3 |
|           | ↔ |              | ↔ |           |
| Tileset A |   |"Keep current"|   | Tileset B |
 ———————————     ——————————————     ———————————
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this layout, depending on the player direction, the Section 2 tileset may be displayed either with Tileset A, or with Tileset B.</p>

<p>Which means that <strong>by design, a “Keep current” section can only use the tiles shared by the adjacent tilesets</strong>, in that case the Tilesets A and B. If this rule is not honored, the graphics of the “Keep current” section will be corrupted.</p>

<p>So by introducing some design constraints, the game avoids to ensure that every tileset has to be compatible with any tileset that could be adjacent to it. Now the game designers just have to ensure that some sections only use a restricted number of tiles shared between the adjacent tilesets. These “Keep current” sections will feature less unique details, but will ensure that transitions between different tilesets are always glitch-free.</p>



<p>The only thing that remains is to <strong>ensure that the player can never navigate directly from a tileset to another</strong> – but instead always goes through a “Keep current” area first.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, this reveals the hidden structure of Link’s Awakening Overworld map.</p>

<p>Here’s the same Overworld map than above, with the tilesets overlaid – but this time, the “Keep current” tilesets are highlighted in green.</p>

<p><a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets-with-paths.png"><img src="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets-with-paths-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Overworld map of Link's Awakening, with the &quot;No change&quot; tileset overlaid in green"></a>
<em>Overworld map of Link’s Awakening. In green: the “Keep current tilesets. In red: walls and natural obstacles on the map.</em></p>

<p>As you can see, the game designers had to put restrictions to ensure that the player can never directly transition from a tileset to another – but instead goes through a “Keep current” tileset first.</p>

<p>How? <strong>By putting walls and obstacles on the map that separate the tilesets</strong>. These are the one highlighted in red on this map; the player can never go through them. The obstacles constraint the player’s path, and ensure the tilesets continuity.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="impact-on-game-design">Impact on game design</h2>

<p>Like all technical restrictions, limitations on tilesets are also a source of creativity.</p>

<p>Because of the “Keep current” buffer tilesets, it’s easier not to connect every section of the map to every other: obstacles must be built. But this constraint has upsides: <strong>it gives the map a labyrinthine structure</strong>. And that’s helpful for a good game design: it tends to divide the map into distinctly themed sections. Folds also make the world feel larger, like does a curated garden with carefully placed occluders.</p>

<p>The need to interleave buffer tilesets on the map also gives <strong>natural pacing</strong> to the game. Buffer tilesets can’t have the same visual complexity than other sections of the map (because they can only use a limited number of tiles). It makes simpler areas alternate with higher-complexity ones. As a result, the player will usually travel through a strongly-themed section, then a more generic one (as they move through a buffer tileset), then again reach another themed section. This sense of rhythm is a key element of a good game design.</p>

<p>As an addendum on to our four-part look at the general structures of the farming of cereal grains (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">IV</a>) this post is going to briefly discuss some of the key ways that the structures of <strong><em>rice</em> <em>farming </em></strong>differ from the structures of wheat and barley farming.  We’ll start with some of the key differences in the mechanics of rice farming itself, before moving into how those differences might motivate different social and economic organization in the countryside, before finally discussing some of the theories as to how rice farming might – or might not – impact larger structures like the state.</p>

<p>(Quick bibliographic aside: I relied primary for this on Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (206 B.C. – A.D. 220) (1980) and F. Bray, <em>The Rice Economies: Technology and Development in Asian Societies </em>(1986) which were recommended to me by specialists in the field.  The latter is a wealth of technical details on rice cultivation, although it is as focused on the transition to mechanization and modern agriculture as to the conditions of pre-modern rice cultivation.)</p>



<h2>Rice Cultivation</h2>



<p>We want to start with the rice cultivation process.  There are a <em>lot</em> of varieties of rice out there, but the key divide we want to make early is between dry-rice and wet-rice.  When we’re talking about ‘rice cultures’ or ‘rice agriculture,’ generally, we mean wet-rice farming, where the rice is partially submerged during its growing.  Wild rice, as far as we can tell, began as a swamp-grass and thus likes to have quite a lot of water around, although precisely controlling the water availability can lead the rice to be a lot more productive than it would be in its natural habitat.  While there are varieties of rice which can be (and are) farmed ‘dry’ (that is, in unflooded fields much like wheat and barley are farmed), the vast majority of rice farming is ‘wet.’  As with grains, this is not merely a matter of different methods of farming, but of different varieties of rice that have been adapted to that farming; varieties of dry-rice and wet-rice have been selectively bred over millennia to perform best in those environments.</p>



<p>Wet-rice is farmed in paddies, small fields (often <em>very</em> small – some Chinese agronomists write that the ideal size for an individual rice field is around 0.1 hectare, which is just 0.24 acres) surrounded by low ‘bunds’ (small earthwork walls or dykes) to keep in the water, typically around two feet high.  Because controlling the water level is crucial, rice paddies must be very precisely flat, leading to even relatively gentle slopes often being terraced to create a series of flat fields.  Each of these rice paddies (and there will be many because they are so small) are then connected by irrigation canals which channel and control the water in what is often a quite complex system.</p>

<p>The exact timing of rice production is more complex than wheat because a single paddy often sees two crops in a year and the exact planting times vary between areas;  one common cycle on the Yangtze is for a February planting (with a June harvest) followed by a June planting (with a November harvest).  In other areas, paddies planted with rice during the first planting might be drained and sown with a different plant entirely (sometimes including wheat) in the intervening time.</p>



<p>The cycle runs thusly: after the heavy rains of the monsoons (if available), the field is tilled (or plowed, but as we’ll see, manual tillage is often more common).  The seed is then sown (or transplanted) and the field is, using the irrigation system, lightly flooded, so that the young seedlings grow in standing water.  Sometimes the seed is initially planted in a dedicated seed-bed and then transferred to the field, rather than being sown there directly; doing so has a positive impact on yields, but is substantially more labor intensive.  The water level is raised as the plant grows; agian this is labor intensive, but increases yields.  Just before the harvest the fields are drained out and allowed to dry out, before the crop is harvested and then goes into processing.</p>



<p>Rice is threshed much like grain (more often manually threshed and generally not threshed with flails) to release the seeds, the individual rice grains, from the plant.  That is going to free the endosperm of the speed, along with a hull around it and a layer of bran between the two.  Hulling was traditionally done by hand-pounding, which frees the seed from the hull, leaving just the endosperm and some of the bran; this is how you get <em>brown</em> rice, which is essentially ‘whole-grain’ rice.  While it is generally less <em>tasty</em>, the bran actually has quite a lot of nutrients not present in the calorie-rich endosperm.  Whereas <em>white rice</em> is produced by then milling or polishing away the bran to produce a pure, white kernal of the endosperm; it is very tasty, but lacks many of the vitamins that brown rice has.</p>



<p>Consequently, while a diet of mostly brown rice can be healthy, a diet overwhelmingly of <em>white rice</em> leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine_deficiency">Thiamine deficiency</a>, known colloquially as <em>beriberi</em>.  My impression from the literature is that this wasn’t as much an issue prior to the introduction of mechanical milling processes for rice. Mechanical milling made producing white rice in quantity cheap and so it came to dominate the diet to the exclusion of brown rice, producing negative health effects for the poor who could not afford to supplement their rice-and-millet diet with other foods, or for soldiers whose ration was in rice.  But prior to that mechanical milling, brown rice was all that was available for the poor, which in turn meant less Thiamine deficiency among the lower classes of society.</p>



<h2>Farmer Terrain</h2>



<p>Because rice is such a different crop than wheat or barley, there are a lot of differences in the way that rice cultivation shapes the countryside.  We’ll move here from the relatively direct impacts on the organization of farmers and then discuss the more speculative impacts on the organization of whole societies.</p>



<p>The thing to note about <strong>rice is that it is both <em>much</em> more productive on a per-acre basis than wheat or barley, but also <em>much</em> more labor intensive</strong>; it also relies on different forms of capital to be productive.  Whole-grain wheat and brown rice have similar calorie and nutritional value (brown rice is somewhat better in most categories) on a unit-weight basis (so, per pound or ton), but the yield difference is fairly large: rice is typically around (very roughly) 50% more productive per acre than wheat.  Moreover, rice plants have a more favorable ratio of seeds-to-plants, meaning that the demand to put away seeds for the next harvest is easier – whereas crop-to-seed ratios on pre-modern wheat range from 3:1 to 10:1, rice can achieve figures as high as 100:1.  As a result, not only is the gross yield higher (that is, more tons of seed per field) but a lower percentage of that seed has to be saved for the next planting.</p>

Of particular note is how small each individual field is (compare the village on the right-hand side!).</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the same time, the irrigation demands for effective production of wet-rice requires a <em>lot</em> of labor to build and maintain</strong>.  Fields need to be flooded and drained; in some cases (particularly pre-modern terrace farming) this may involve moving the water manually, in buckets, from lower fields to higher ones.  Irrigation canals connecting paddies can make this job somewhat easier, as can bucket-lifts (there’s a picture of a simple one below), but that still demands moving quite a lot of water.  In any irrigation system, the bunds need to be maintained and the water level carefully controlled, with also involves potentially quite a lot of labor.</p>



<p>The consequence of all of this is that while the rice farming household seems to be roughly the same size as the wheat-farming household (that is, an extended family unit of variable size, but typically around 8 or so members), <strong>the farm is much smaller</strong>, with common household farm sizes, even in the modern period, clustering around 1 hectare (2.47 acres) in comparison to the standard household wheat farms clustered around 4-6 acres (which, you may note with the yield figures above, lands us right back at around the same subsistence standard).</p>



<p>Moreover, rice cultivation is less soil dependent (but more water dependent) because wet-rice farming both encourages nitrogen fixation in the soil (maintaining the fertility of it generally without expensive manure use) and because rice farming leads naturally to a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podzol">pozdolisation</a>, slowly converting the underlying soil over a few years to a set of characteristics which are more favorable for more rice cultivation.  So whereas with wheat cultivation, where you often have clumps of marginal land (soil that is too wet, too dry, too rocky, too acidic, too uneven, too heavily forested, and so on), rice cultivation tends to be able to make use of almost any land where there is sufficient water (although terracing may be needed to level out the land).  The reliance on the rice itself to ‘terraform’ its own fields does mean that new rice fields tended to under-produce for the first few years.</p>

<p>The medieval toilet or latrine, then called a privy or garderobe, was a primitive affair, but in a castle, one might find a little more comfort and certainly a great deal more design effort than had been invested elsewhere. Practicality, privacy, and efficient waste disposal were all considered and, even today, one of the most prominent and easily identifiable features of ruined medieval castles is the latrines which protrude from their exterior walls.</p>
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>Medieval toilets, just as today, were often referred to by a euphemism, the most common being 'privy chamber', just 'privy' or 'garderobe'. Other names included the ‘draught’, ‘gong’, ‘siege-house’, ‘neccessarium’, and even ‘Golden Tower’. Garderobe later came to mean wardrobe in French, but its original meaning was likely just any small cupboard or room and, as space was at a premium in a castle, the toilets were never any bigger than absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>Exteriors</h3>
<p>The toilets of a castle were usually built into the walls so that they projected out on corbels and any waste fell below and into the castle moat. Even better, waste went directly into a river as is the case of the latrines of one of the large stone halls at <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Chepstow_Castle/">Chepstow Castle</a> in Wales, built from the 11th century CE. Some castles, such as the 11th-century CE Corfe Castle in Dorset, England had latrine shafts emptying directly in the courtyard or bailey while still others hung conveniently over a cliff face, as at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, England, built in 1176-1777 CE.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;Coity&nbsp;Castle in Wales, there were three tiers of toilets with the shafts emptying into the same courtyard basement.</p>
<p>The protruding shaft of masonry that made up the toilet was buttressed from below or might nestle in the junction between a tower and <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/wall/">wall</a>. Some waste shafts were short while others reached almost to the ground. In the latter case, that might prove a dangerous design feature if there were a siege of the castle. Indeed, besiegers used just such a latrine shaft in 1203-4 CE to gain entry to Chateau Gaillard on the River Seine in France, built by Richard I (r. 1189-99 CE) at the end of the 12th century CE. After the siege, to ensure no repeat of the trick, a masonry wall was built around the shaft exit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another design was to have tiers of toilets on the outside wall where the shafts all sent waste to the same collection point. <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Dover_Castle/">Dover Castle</a>, built in the second half of the 11th century CE, had a cesspit at the base of one wall of the keep to collect waste from the toilets above. At Coity Castle in Wales, built in the 12th century CE, there were three tiers of toilets with the shafts emptying into the same courtyard basement. The same arrangement was found at Langley Castle in Northumberland, England, built c. 1350 CE, with the common collection point being a pit which was cleaned out by a natural stream. There were also toilets in ground floor buildings and these had stone drainage channels to drain away waste. Waste from such collection points, or the ditch in general,&nbsp;was likely collected by local farmers to be reused as fertiliser. When castles became larger and more comfortable from the 14th century CE, so the number of conveniences increased. Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, England, for example, had no fewer than 28 toilets emptying out into its moat.</p>

<h3>Interiors</h3>
<p>Viewed from the interior, the toilet was set back in a recess or within a mural chamber (a passage within a wall) but not all were given the luxury of a wooden door. A short narrow passageway sometimes led to a toilet, often with a right-angle turn for greater privacy. Pairs of toilets, separated by a wall, were not uncommon and these might share the same waste chute. The chamber of the castle’s lord often had a private latrine but even he had, like everyone else, a chamber pot if needed. The castle’s priest might also be one of the lucky few to have an <em>en-suite</em> toilet for his own chamber, as at Northampton Castle, England, built in the late 11th century CE. Another sure place to find a castle toilet was in the corner of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Great_Hall/">Great Hall</a> where audiences and banquets were held.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The toilet seat was made of a wooden bench covering the shaft hole in the masonry. The wood was usually cut with a rectangular or keyhole aperture. Hay, grass, or even moss were used as toilet paper. Toilet hay is referred to by medieval writers, albeit indirectly. Jocelin de Brakelond, the 12th-century CE English monk, recounted the story that a fire had almost broken out in the Abbey of Bury St. Edmonds when a candle had burned dangerously close to the hay in one of the abbey’s privies.</p>
<p>Some toilets had a window to let in fresh air, which for the same reason was not shuttered like other windows of a castle. The floor may have been scattered with rushes and aromatic herbs and flowers, just as the Great Hall of the castle was, to deter vermin and offer a more pleasant fragrance than the users could provide. Walls were sometimes whitewashed with a coating of lime-plaster which maximised the light coming from the small window and because lime kills off bacteria.</p>

<p>The toilet was cleaned either by a simple bucket of water thrown down the shaft or by diverting the wastewater from the kitchen sinks. More rarely, rainwater was diverted from gutters above the latrine which might also be collected into a cistern and then periodically opened to flush the toilet shaft. Despite these&nbsp;refinements, there can be no doubt that a castle toilet stank to high heaven. Indeed, it was not uncommon to hang clothing near latrines as the pungent ammonia fumes helped to kill mites. <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Henry_III_of_England/">Henry III of England</a> (r. 1216-1272 CE) famously made mention of the problem of unsavoury odours in a letter to one of his castle constables, ordering a no-expense-spared refit of the amenities of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Tower_of_London/">Tower of London</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the privy chamber…in London is situated in an undue and improper place, wherefore it smells badly, we command you on the faith and love by which you are bounden to us that you in no wise omit to cause another privy chamber to be made…in such more fitting and proper place that you may select there, even though it should cost a hundred pounds, so that it may be made before the feast of the Translation of Saint Edward, before we come thither. (Gies, 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Urinals</h3>
<p>Triangular urinals were built into some tower walls so that defenders did not have to leave their post for very long. An example is to be found in the mural passage at Orford Castle in Suffolk, England, built in the second half of the 12th century CE. It seems that even such basic human activities were considered by architects to provide the best possible defence of the castle against all comers in all situations. Intriguingly, at Castle Rising in Norfolk, England, built in the mid-12th century CE, there are two toilets next to each other but in separate rooms, one with a toilet and one with a urinal which might perhaps be evidence of a separation of the sexes.&nbsp;</p> </article><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>At Hashnode we have been experimenting a lot with blockchain and its use-cases. We have been running a developers’ community ourselves, and the idea behind “decentralized communities” fascinates me a lot. The fact that everyone owns the data and controls the platform can give rise to new types of social apps and disrupt the traditional way of building online communities.</p>
<p>Platforms like <a target="_blank" href="https://steemit.com/">Steemit</a> have proven that it’s possible to build such communities and reward users for their contributions. But how should someone go about replicating it and launching their own decentralized social platform powered by blockchain?</p>
<p>To answer the question, I took up the challenge of building a decentralized version of HackerNews.</p>
<p>During the process, I evaluated multiple platforms and finally zeroed in on a protocol called <a target="_blank" href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>. Using Tendermint, I have built a prototype called “Mint” which can serve as a boilerplate for building blockchain-powered social apps.</p>
<p>The codebase is on GitHub. You can check out the following links for code and demo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint">Mint Blockchain</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/Uphack">Website Code (Blockchain Front-end)</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="http://uphack.co/">Demo</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does it take to build a blockchain-powered social community where the user-generated data is decentralized? If you are looking for an answer, you have come to the right place. Read on.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-observations">Preliminary Observations</h2>
<p>Initially, I thought of utilizing an existing platform to build the app. Smart Contract platforms like <strong>Ethereum</strong>, <strong>NEM</strong>, <strong>NEO</strong>, and so on offer storage of assets, but these are not designed to store large amount of data.</p>
<p>HyperLedger Fabric is compelling, but it’s designed to be deployed in private blockchain networks. Hashgraph sounds interesting, but it’s experimental as of now.</p>
<p>Other potential solutions were: <strong>Lisk Sidechains</strong>, <strong>Loom Network,</strong> and <strong>BigChainDB</strong>. The first two are in private alpha (invite-only), while BigChainDB is powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>.</p>
<p>So, instead of using BigChainDB, I decided to play around with Tendermint directly and see what was possible.</p>
<h2 id="why-tendermint">Why Tendermint</h2>
<p>Tendermint is a protocol that takes care of the consensus layer using BFT algorithm while you just focus on writing the business logic.</p>
<p>The beauty of the protocol is that you are literally free to choose any programming language to build an interface (Application Blockchain Interface or simply ABCI) that interacts with the blockchain.</p>
<p>Tendermint handles the most complex aspects of a blockchain such as block production rounds, peer to peer connectivity, gossiping about new blocks, transaction handling, and more. It stores the transactions on the disk using LevelDB and also delivers the confirmed transaction to your ABCI server so that you can create a global state out of it.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting? Let’s see how to create a blockchain app that stores data on chain using Tendermint.</p>
<h2 id="whats-needed">What’s Needed?</h2>
<p>Here is what you are going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Macbook / Ubuntu server</p>
</li>
<li><p>Golang</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tendermint</p>
</li>
<li><p>MongoDB</p>
</li>
<li><p>And beer… (Coffee lovers can replace this with coffee)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-machine">Setting up the Machine</h2>
<p>Tendermint is written in <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. So, we need to install the Go language first. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/dl/">this link</a> to check out a few download options. If you are on Ubuntu, you can follow <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@patdhlk/how-to-install-go-1-9-1-on-ubuntu-16-04-ee64c073cd79">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>By default, Go chooses <code>$HOME/go</code> as your workspace. If you want to use a different location as your workspace, you can set <code>GOPATH</code> variable in <code>~/.profile</code> . From now on, we’ll refer to this location as <code>GOPATH</code>.</p>
<p>Here is how <code>~/.profile</code> file looks on my machine:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> GOPATH=<span>"<span>$HOME</span>/go"</span> 
<span>export</span> PATH=~/.yarn/bin:<span>$GOPATH</span>/bin:<span>$PATH</span>
<span>export</span> GOBIN=<span>"<span>$GOPATH</span>/bin"</span>
</code></pre><p>Remember to set <code>GOBIN</code> variable as shown above. This is where the Go binaries will be installed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to run source ~/.profile after updating the file.</strong></p>
<p>Now we can install Tendermint. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>cd $GOPATH/src/github.com</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>mkdir tendermint</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>cd tendermint</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>git clone [<span>https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint</span>](<span>https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint</span>)
</code></pre><p>This will install the latest version of Tendermint. As I have tested my code against <code>v0.19.7</code>, let’s check out the specific release.</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> <span>tendermint</span>
<span>git</span> <span>checkout</span> <span>v0</span><span>.19</span><span>.7</span>
</code></pre><p>This will put you on v0.19.7. To proceed with the installation, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code><span>make</span> get_tools 
<span>make</span> get_vendor_deps
<span>make</span> install
</code></pre><p>Congrats! You have installed Tendermint successfully. If everything was installed as intended, the command <code>tendermint version</code> will print out the Tendermint version.</p>
<p>Now, you should go ahead and install <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/">MongoDB</a>.</p>
<h2 id="coding-the-blockchain">Coding the Blockchain</h2>
<p>If you want to understand how Tendermint works, go through <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599215400067/l5utsBotC.html#intro-to-abci">this guide</a>. You may also find the following diagram helpful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6668/1*JYygIBf5rs8ujW5C1TRlvA.png" alt="Source: [Tendermint Docs](http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/projects/tools/en/master/introduction.html)"><em>Source: <a target="_blank" href="http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/projects/tools/en/master/introduction.html">Tendermint Docs</a></em></p>
<p>I’ll outline a few important concepts here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tendermint core handles the consensus part.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to write an ABCI server that handles the business logic, validations, and so on. Although you can write this in any language, our language of choice will be Go.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tendermint core will interact with your ABCI server via socket connections.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ABCI server has many methods (JS developers can think of them as callbacks) that will be invoked by Tendermint core on various events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two important methods are: <code>CheckTx</code> and <code>DeliverTx</code>. The first one is called to validate a transaction, while the latter is called when the <code>Tx</code> is confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>DeliverTx</code> helps you take necessary actions based on the confirmed transactions. In our case, we’ll use this to create and update our global state stored in MongoDB.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tendermint uses BFT consensus. This means more than 2/3 of the validators need to have consensus in order to commit a transaction. So, even if 1/3 of the validators go rogue, the blockchain will still work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a real world scenario (at least in a public deployment), you will most likely add some sort of consensus such as PoS (Proof of State) in addition to BFT consensus. In this case, we’ll just go ahead with simple BFT consensus. I’ll leave adding PoS up to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest that you clone the blockchain ABCI server (code-named <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint">mint</a>) from GitHub. But before we go ahead, we need to install a dependency management tool called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a>.</p>
<p>If you are on a Mac, you can just run <code>brew install dep</code> . For Ubuntu, run the following command.</p>
<pre><code><span>curl</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
</code></pre><p>Now you can clone the codebase of mint.</p>
<pre><code>cd $GOPATH/src
git clone [<span>https://github.com/Hashnode/mint</span>](<span>https://github.com/Hashnode/mint</span>)
cd mint
dep ensure
go install mint
</code></pre><p>Sweet! You have now installed mint, which is an ABCI server and works along with Tendermint core.</p>
<p>Now, let me walk you through the whole set-up and all the code.</p>
<h2 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h2>
<p>You can find the code (and entry point) on GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint/blob/master/mint.go">here</a>.</p>
<p>The entry point of the app is <code>mint.go</code> . The most important part of the file is the following section:</p>
<pre><code>app = jsonstore.NewJSONStoreApplication(db)
srv, err := server.NewServer(<span>"tcp://0.0.0.0:46658"</span>, <span>"socket"</span>, app) <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {  <span>return</span> err }
</code></pre><p>All the business logic, methods, and so on are defined in the package <code>jsonstore</code> . The above code simply creates a TCP server on port <code>46658</code> that accepts socket connections from Tendermint core.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <code>jsonstore</code>package.</p>
<h2 id="business-logic">Business Logic</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint/blob/master/jsonstore/jsonstore.go">Here’s</a> the <code>jsonstore</code> repo.</p>
<p>Our ABCI server does two important things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validates incoming transactions. If a transaction is invalid, it returns an error code and the transaction is rejected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once a transaction is committed (confirmed by &gt; 2/3 of the validators) and stored in LevelDB, the ABCI server updates its global state stored in MongoDB.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to use <a target="_blank" href="https://labix.org/mgo">mgo</a> for interacting with MongoDB. So, <code>jsonstore.go</code> defines 5 models that correspond to 5 different MongoDB collections.</p>
<p>The code looks like the following:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
				<p>When it comes to modern web application development, MongoDB is the king. If you are a full stack programmer, you hear about MERN or MEAN stacks every day. The <b>M</b> is in every one of them and it stands for MongoDB. The free and open source community version of MongoDB powers a large number of Web applications. From its humble beginnings in 2007, MongoDB has come a long way. It is the primary product behind the company MongoDB Inc. with over 10 billion dollars in market capitalisation. Like many other products before and after, online advertising was the key catalyst behind the vision and development of MongoDB. The story of MongoDB is an interesting one and in this article, I will take you on a journey through the MongoDB land and its history.</p>
<h2>The Idea of the Humongous Database – The Beginnings</h2>
<p>The story of MongoDB has its beginnings much earlier than 2007. In 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Merriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Merriman</a> and Kevin O’Connor created the famous online advertising company DoubleClick. Kevin Ryan joined the team soon after(Dwight and Kevin later cofounded 5 companies together – Gilt, 10gen, Panther Express, ShopWiki and Business Insider). DoubleClick soon took off and within a few years it was serving as much as 400,000 ads/second. Such large scale traffic was not anticipated by the relational database technologies available at that time. Configuring relational databases for such scale also required substantial amount of money and hardware resources. So Dwight(who was the CTO at the time) and his team wrote custom database implementations to scale DoubleClick for the increased traffic. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early talks on MongoDB</a>, Dwight talks about getting a network hardware with serial number 7 and wondering whether it will work! This was even before the invention of load balancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-people.jpg" width="300px" alt="People behind MongoDB" title="People behind MongoDB">In 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Horowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliot Horowitz</a> joined DoubleClick R&amp;D division as a software engineer immediately after his college. Within 2 years he left DoubleClick to start ShopWiki along with Dwight. Both of them realised that they were solving the same horizontal scalability issues again and again. So in 2007, Dwight, Eliot and Kevin Ryan started a new company called 10gen. 10gen was focused on creating a PaaS hosting solution with its own application and database stack. 10gen soon got the attention of the venture capitalist Albert Wenger (Union Square Ventures) and he invested $1.5 million into it. This is what <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2008/07/10gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Wenger wrote in 2008 about the 10gen investment</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen. They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service. The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby. The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Albert was refering to as “the database with interesting design” was in fact MongoDB. Rapid development on the new database was undertaken from 2007 to 2009. The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e73188b5512c82290a4070af4afddac20d0b981e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first commit of the MongoDB database server by Dwight can be seen here</a>. The core engine was written in C++. The database was named MongoDB since the idea was to use it to store and serve humongous amount of data required in typical use cases such as content serving. Initially the team had only 4 engineers(including Dwight and Eliot) and decided to focus just on the MongoDB database instead of the initial PaaS product. The business idea was to release the database as an open source free download and offer commercial support and training services on top of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB 1.0 was released</a> in February 2009. The initial version focused on providing a usable query language with document model, indexing and basic support for replication. It also had experimental version of sharding, but production ready sharding clusters were available only in version 1.6 released a year later.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongodb-user/X0Le3mBel2I/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Dwight responded to a question</a> on the suitability of Mongo for a highly scalable system (MongoDB user group – September 2009),</p>
<blockquote><p>
For horizontal scaling, one would use auto-sharding to build out large MongoDB clusters.  This is in alpha now, but if your project is just getting started, it will be in production by the time you need it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Early MongoDB Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the early years, the basic design principles behind MongoDB development were the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data model for faster programming – document model with CRUD.</li>
<li>Use of familiar language and format – JavaScript/JSON.</li>
<li>Schema less documents for agile iterative development.</li>
<li>Only essential features for faster development and easy scaling. No join, no transactions across collections.</li>
<li>Support easy horizontal scaling and durability/availability (replication/sharding).</li>
</ul>
<p>In his ZendCon 2011 presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOQJpGu1kY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“NoSQL and why we created MongoDB”</a>, Dwight talks about these principles in detail. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=2408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 minutes mark</a>, there is also an interesting discussion on the difference between replication and sharding. As the database server code matured and once MongoDB hit the mainstream, many of these principles were obviously diluted. Latest MongoDB server versions support joining to some extend and since MongoDB 4.2, even distributed transactions are supported!</p>
<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>Before we get into detailed MongoDB history and how it evolved over the years, let us briefly look at what exactly it is!</p>
<p>MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database. It can run on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and the open source version is available as a free download. MongoDB stores data entities in a container called collection and each piece of data stored is in a JSON document format. For example, if a customer submits an online order, the entire details of that order (order number, order line items, delivery address etc.) are kept in a single hierarchical document in JSON format. It is then saved to a collection named “customer_order”.</p>
<p>MongoDB also comes with a console client called MongoDB shell. This is a fully functional JavaScript environment using which you can add, remove, edit or query document data in the database.</p>
<h2>MongoDB Architecture</h2>
<p>The following MongoDB architecture diagram provides a high level view of the major components in the MongoDB server.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-architecture.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB Architecture Diagram" title="MongoDB Architecture Diagram"></p>
<p>MongoDB currently offers <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers for 13 languages</a> including Java, Node.JS, Python, PHP and Swift. The storage engine MMAPv1 is removed since version 4.2. The encrypted storage engine is only supported in the commercial enterprise server.</p>
<p>The beauty of MongoDB is that using the same open source free community server you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a simple single machine instance suitable for most small applications.</li>
<li>Run a multi-machine instance with durability/high availability suitable for most business applications.</li>
<li>Run a large horizontally scaled cluster of machines(shard cluster) handling both very large sets of data and high volume of query traffic. MongoDB provides automatic infrastructure to distribute both data and its processing across machines. A typical use case would be running a popular ad service with thousands of customers and millions of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagrams show various options available for running MongoDB instances.</p>
<h2>Single Server/Fault Tolerant Setup</h2>
<p>For small applications, a single server setup is enough with frequent data backups. For installations that require fault tolerance, a replica set implementation can be done. In the fault tolerant deployment, usually there are 3 or more MongoDB instances. Only one of them work as the primary instance and if it fails, one of the other 2 secondaries takes over as the primary. The data is identical in all instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment1.jpg" width="800px" alt="Single server/fault tolerant setup" title="Single server/fault tolerant setup"></p>
<h2>Shard Cluster for Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>For a large database with both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance requirements, a MongoDB shard cluster is configured. As can be seen from the diagram below, minimum recommended number of machines for a fault tolerant shard cluster is 14! Each fault tolerant replica set in this case handles only a subset of the data. This data partitioning is automatically done by MongoDB engine.<br>
<img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment2.jpg" width="800px" alt="Shard cluster with partitioned data" title="Shard cluster with partitioned data"></p>
<p>When you download the latest version of MongoDB (4.4) and extract it, you will find that it contains only the following 3 main files,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mongo</b> – MongoDB shell for interacting with your server using JavaScript based commands.</li>
<li><b>mongod</b> – The MongoDB main executable. This can run as a single database instance, as a database member of a sharded cluster or as a configuration server of a sharded cluster.</li>
<li><b>mongos</b> – A router application only needed for sharded horizontally scaled cluster of database servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mac machine, the total size of these 3 executables is around 150MB. These are the only components you need for any type of MongoDB deployments! In a world of bloated software, this is a welcome change! This simplicity and elegance is what makes MongoDB so powerful and reliable.</p>
<h2>Evolution of MongoDB (2009 to 2020)</h2>
<p>MongoDB 1.0 was released in February 2009 and it had most of the basic query functionalities. MongoDB 1.2 was released in December 2009 and it introduced large scale data processing using map-reduce. Realising that MongoDB has good potential, 10gen quickly ramped up the team. MongoDB 1.4 (March 2010) introduced background index creation and MongoDB 1.6 (August 2010) introduced some major features such as production ready sharding for horizontal scaling, replica sets with automatic failover and IPv6 support.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-timeline1.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB 2009 to 2013" title="MongoDB 2009 to 2013"></p>
<p>By 2012, 10gen had 100 employees and the company started providing 24/7 support. MongoDB 2.2 release(August 2012) introduced aggregation pipeline enabling multiple data processing steps as a chain of …</p></div></div>

Waves power into the coast, with an almighty force, whilst many surfers await, ready to make the most of the towering water as it breaks. Having spent a lot of my childhood in Cornwall and still returning to this day, I always take the chance to get out on the water.</p><p>Obviously waves are powerful things, but there is more to their power than meets the eyes and I wanted to explore their true power.</p><p>A wave breaks when it wants, it is as powerful as it wants, the wave couldn’t care less if you’re riding it or not. There is no controlling it. It’s just you responding and reacting to the wave. Your reaction is all you can control. This creates a connection, a relationship between you and the water. One that you are a part of, but just to observe and react, all you can do is do your best and the wave will do its own thing. This connection is natural and raw, just you and the elements, nothing else is interfering or interrupting.</p><p>This connection with what’s around you and the earth, as you are riding the wave to the shore, also forms with fellow surfers riding the wave. Enjoying that same moment and experience, unique in many ways.</p><p>Nothing else is in the way or is there to disturb or interrupt you, there is a indisputable focus on the present. As if time is slowing down, watching the colours, ripples and feeling the undercurrent, strength and force of the wave. Lots of this happens subconsciously but this focus on the present can be hard to replicate elsewhere.</p><p>Waves are continuous, if you miss one, another is on the horizon. If you mess it up, then you can try again on the next. You just do your best and keep at it. There is something liberating about the idea you can just try again the next day and that’s ok. No pressure, limit or finiteness.</p><p>The artistic nature of the waves swirling, building and crashing is beautiful to watch, especially up close. It’s as if the movement has emotion, yet is unaware and not caring of what’s in front. As if it has a mind of it’s own.</p><p>The true power of waves is more than just the force of the water then.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, <a href="https://www.mattswain.co.uk/newsletter">sign up to my newsletter </a>for more ideas,  thoughts and insights into thinking without limits. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Imagine a computer-based system visualizing your thoughts and secret thoughts; yes, it's possible now by artificial intelligence assistance. Recent advancements in hardware innovation have re-energized technology. It becomes more accurate, authentic, can produce better sound, accurate visualization, and understanding of the location. Outstanding computer processors support computer to make a decision, plan outputs and don't repeat the mistake as they learn from it. The four scientists in Kyoto at Kyoto University did an exceptional experiment that exceeds the global expectations about such a dreamy truth. </p><p>Tomoyasu Horikawa, Guohua Shen, Yukiyasu Kamitani, and Kei Majima recently published their <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf">results in a paper </a>on a scientific research platform &nbsp;BioRxiv. They have done their experiment in ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. Their study mainly exposes the decoding of human thoughts using an artificially intelligent system. &nbsp;The artificial intelligence system becomes so smart and real to duplicate human minds and show what they're thinking in their minds. &nbsp;Now scientists are successful in developing the next phase of AI machine, which uses human psychology. It is a leading technology from science fiction to merely science phenomena.</p><p>Below video is demonstration of Tomoyasu’s work. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrO1v7-KcXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-is-helping-human-beings"><a href="https://thinkml.ai/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-common-people/">Machine Learning is helping human beings</a> </h3><p>Machine learning is in use since many years ago in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. It helped generate a visual impact of human thinking in the form of binary mages or geographic shapes. The images obtained are of simple shapes or pixels. However, another prediction that the human brain thinks in unique patterns of image creation; different thinking levels, either with simple or complex components.</p><p>The idea of processing human thoughts is not new as we can see 1950s videos where doctors used to put contraptions on the human brain. It helps them to decipher the thoughts always running in their patient's minds. A British Serial <strong>Quatermass and the Pit </strong>shows a similar technique to translate the alien's thoughts.</p><p>The scientists from the United States, China, and Japan utilize this fantasy to change it into reality. They use <strong>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </strong>strategy for better measurement of brain activity. The deep neural networks involved in replicating human brain functioning procedure.</p><h3 id="the-emergence-of-artificial-people-with-machine-learning-system">The emergence of Artificial People with Machine Learning System</h3><p>Machines come with consciousness and result in developing a direct relationship between humans and machines. The day is coming when robots not only talk but can laugh, fight, and be cruel with the power of advancement in technology. Some research laboratories are busy making a force that can sense its surrounding environment and show response according to it. They sense human thoughts running in their minds and visualize to others. It's beneficial to know and see the thoughts of those quality people who are extraordinary but can't speak.</p><p>Alan Turing said:</p><blockquote>‘’If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, it is as intelligent as a human being.’’</blockquote><h3 id="is-it-telepathy-or-something-advanced">Is it Telepathy or Something Advanced?</h3><p>The whole world is excited about the news of AI reading minds, but the reality is somewhat not as same as appearing to us. Machine learning is still unable to detect rightly what we think, feel, desire, wish, or need at a specific time. The science is aiming to decipher the images that subjects see for a period. Thus, machine learning uses a reconstruction of a visual filed algorithm for a visual demonstration of thoughts.</p><p>In the last years, scientists strive to create a system that can judge images based on their shapes, characters, and letters when a subject’s mind view them.</p><h3 id="kyoto-university-research-by-four-scientists">Kyoto University Research by Four Scientists</h3><p>The advances in the development of artificial intelligence also use a <strong>deep neural network </strong>to decode human thoughts. &nbsp;They aimed to develop a method that not only deciphers the images but also regenerate the same one. Therefore, the four efficient scientists at Kyoto University utilized the BioRxiv platform and <strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN)</strong> as a proxy to share their findings of thought decoding. These neural systems help decode images of thoughts in the human brain and produce a visual prediction that resembles a person's thinking.</p><p>More generalized; the system should visualize the image about which its system is not trained previously after decoding the thoughts. &nbsp;It can see or covert human thoughts into images.</p><h3 id="how-does-ai-can-visualize-our-thinking-process">How Does AI Can Visualize our Thinking Process? </h3><p>The basis of this system is to scan the human brain deeply. For this purpose, the scientists introduce fMRI (Functional MRI) that scans the brain's core over traditional MRI that involves only monitoring brain activity. The unusual behavior of fMRI is its ability to track <strong>blood flow </strong>to the brain and <strong>brainwaves. </strong></p><p>It takes data from the scan and interprets what the subject was thinking when data was taken from it? The actual decoding occurs in the <strong>complex neural network </strong>that converts data into image format. But the humans have to rain the system first to get-go everything. They train the machine about the human brain thinking strategy that how it works and make a solution. It gets information from blood flow as it tracks blood's path, way, direction, and speed to reach the brain.</p><p>After it, the system starts producing images related to the information it gets by tracking blood flow. The process is only possible if the system comes with multilayers of <strong>deep neural networks. DNN</strong>involves the processing of information in image form. The information is then carried towards <strong>Deep Generator Network (DGN) Algorithm, </strong>which finally creates the image with high precision and accuracy. If we obtain images without using DGN, we can't get a high resolution or clear images of a different thought. DGN captures faces, eyes, and textual patterns and produces high-quality visual clues. With an efficient DGN algorithm, efficiency can be exceeded to 99%, and highly matching decoded images are obtained.</p><h3 id="the-methodology-of-the-experiment-deep-image-reconstruction">The methodology of the Experiment; Deep Image Reconstruction</h3><p>In simple words, the system consists of two necessary steps:</p><p>1. &nbsp;A subject sees an image, and the same image is shown to the AI system; thus, it can recreate its image.<br>2. &nbsp;After it, the subject’s brain thinks about that image, and AI recreates the same image by showing real-time response.</p><p>The scientists selected three subjects and showed them natural geometric shapes, artificial images, and other objects of varying characters. They repeated the same exposure of showing objects in varying periods for almost ten weeks and recorded their brainwaves. In <strong>experiment number one</strong>, they recorded the brain activity of the subject when seeing the particular object out of 25. In contrast, they measured brain activity by hiding the image and asked the brain to think about it (<strong>experiment number 2</strong>). </p><p>In both scenarios, they recorded the image created by artificial intelligence and then compared them to get staggering results. The filtered data is considered as a template of sorts. Then they used a decoder to identify the images via fMRI. They scanned brain activity and used the reverse-engineered method to produce an image of information obtained from thoughts. The scientists enabled <strong>deep learning networks </strong>to understand the brainwaves and decode its information to get output.</p><p>AI is so fast as it has the power of guessing about a particular problem. It asks and answers its questions at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="ai-visualizing-static-thoughts">AI Visualizing Static Thoughts </h3><p>Results were outstanding as the computer reconstructed that image but with low accuracy. The quality of images in both experiments was fizzy and comparatively low in the second experiment case. The reason was that it's difficult for a brain to remember an image as identical as it is. It enables scientists to decode ''hieratical'' images with various colors, pixels, and formations. The system establishes, for instance, can predict a picture of a bird, a plant, or an animal. Technology goes on proceeding towards refinement for better implementation of a particular process. </p><h3 id="statement-of-kamitani-about-the-project">Statement of Kamitani About the Project</h3><p>Kamitani was excited about their mutual hard work and getting mind-blowing results. He talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>as:</p><blockquote>‘’We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person sees just by looking at its brain activity. Our previous method was to suppose that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.''</blockquote><blockquote>'These neural networks or AI models can be used as a proxy for the human brain's hierarchical structure,' he added more. </blockquote><h3 id="ai-decoding-videos-you-re-watching-from-your-brain-activity">AI Decoding Videos You’re Watching from Your Brain Activity</h3><p>There is another group of scientists who published their research on ‘<strong>’Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision’’ </strong>in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>. They developed deep learning algorithms to scan the human brain and its working principles to decode its information.</p><p>Their experiment was based on three women who watched videos of hundreds of unique categories for several hours, and the scientists recorded their brain activity. The videos were on birds, airplanes, and other related objects. They obtained images from a popular Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision. The scientists used a functional MRI machine that measures signals of activity in the visual cortex. As the women watched several clips, the deep learning algorithms predicted activity closely related to the actual brain activity. Dozens of brain parts respond to a specific thought; thus, the artificial system mimics natural brain working strategies and shows visible results. </p><p>It also helped scientists to recognize which part of the cortex is involved in thought …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Dijkstra famously dissed testing by saying “Program testing can be used to show
the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”
As if you should choose one over the other.
I don’t see them as opposites but as complementary techniques that
should both be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of formal verification.
Formal verification tools can be the best bug-finding tools you have
ever used.
And they can completely eliminate entire classes of bugs from your code.
But, formal verification won’t find bugs in your
specification; or in your assumptions about your dependencies; or in your
build/CI harness, etc. (See <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/fonseca:ecs:2017">Fonseca</a> for more examples
of where testing has found bugs in formally verified systems.)</p>

<p>And, we all reluctantly agree that Dijkstra was right: even a thorough,
perfectly executed test plan can miss bugs.</p>

<p>So, for the last few months, I have been trying to have both.
We (my team and I at Google) have been reimplementing Jason Lingle’s
<a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest">proptest</a> property-testing library for use with Rust formal verification tools.
The original proptest lets you write test harnesses to test that your code
(probably) satisfies properties.
Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">a reimplementation of the proptest interface</a>
that enables you to use exactly the same test harnesses to
formally verify that the properties hold.
So far, we have only tried this with the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a>
but our implementation is based on the verification
interface used in <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/">verification competitions</a> so it should be
possible to port our library to many other verification tools.<sup id="fnref:for-Rust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:for-Rust">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[Before I go any further, I should mention that what we are <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">releasing this
week</a> is a very early research prototype.  It is not ready for serious use
and it is definitely not an official, supported Google product.  We are
releasing it now, in its current, immature state because we want to have
a conversation about how programmers want to formally verify Rust code
and we think that it is helpful to have something to push against.
We welcome pull requests that add support for other verifiers, or that
push the design in a better direction.]</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proptest-test-harness">A proptest test harness</h2>

<p>To get an idea for what property testing looks like in <code>proptest</code>,
we’ll look at an example from the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">proptest book</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_add(a in 0..1000i32, b in 0..1000i32) {
        let sum = add(a, b);
        assert!(sum &gt;= a);
        assert!(sum &gt;= b);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example defines a property called <code>test_add</code> that tests a function called
<code>add</code>.  In particular, it checks that, for non-negative values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the
result of <code>sum(a, b)</code> is at least as large as <code>a</code> and as <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The notation <code>0..1000i32</code> represents the set of all values in the range <code>[0 ..
1000)</code> and the notation <code>a in 0..1000i32</code> says that a value <code>a</code> should be
chosen from that set.</p>

<p>The <code>proptest!</code> macro converts this property into a test function
that repeatedly generates random values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and executes the
body of the property.</p>

<p>(After adding in <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">some additional glue code</a>) we can run this example with the command</p>



<p>which produces the following output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, if we deliberately write a property that doesn’t hold, then <code>cargo test</code>
produces output more like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

---- test_add stdout ----
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'Test failed: assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100; minimal failing input: a = 0, b = 0
        successes: 0
        local rejects: 0
        global rejects: 0
', src/main.rs:7:1


failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="verifying-with-propverify">Verifying with propverify</h2>

<p>Proptest checks the above property by generating random values and testing.
But we can also interpret the property as saying that for all values
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the sets, the body of the property will not panic.
That is, we can interpret it as a universally quantified specification.</p>

<p>To verify the above property, we use a script that compiles the Rust
code, invokes the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a> and filters
the output of KLEE to determine whether there is any choice of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> that can cause the body of the property to panic.</p>



<p>This produces output like this: confirming that the property does hold</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Running 1 test(s)
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed
VERIFICATION_RESULT: VERIFIED
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, if we change the example property so that the property does not hold,
<code>cargo-verify</code> produces this output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9

running 1 test
  Value a = 0
  Value b = 0
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On this example, random testing and formal verification produced similar
results.
I could have chosen an example where formal verification found a bug that
random testing misses.
Or I could have chosen an example where random testing easily finds
a bug but formal verification spins forever.
But, in this post, I wanted to focus on the similarity between the two
approaches, not the differences.</p>

<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>

<p>In this article, we used an example that was easy to explain but
does not really show off the power of <code>propverify</code>.
Some slightly better examples are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/compatibility-test/src/collections.rs#L60">collections.rs</a>
where we check properties involving standard Rust collection
types such as vectors and B-trees.
(This should be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/collection/index.html">proptest
documentation</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/0a6a0ff2b3880eb4a19d8161bfae8d163b0a65ec/compatibility-test/src/dynamic.rs#L82">dynamic.rs</a>
where we check properties involving trait objects by
quantifying over a subset of the possible instances of the trait.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, we have more documentation about</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-propverify.md">Using the propverify library</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-annotations.md">Using the lower level <code>verification-annotations</code> API</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-klee.md">The many, many flags we use when compiling Rust code so that it can be verified with KLEE</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two are mostly for the benefit of verification tool developers.</p>

<h2 id="our-next-steps">Our next steps</h2>

<p><em>[You can either read this as a sketch of what we plan to do or
as an admission of what we have not yet done.
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Fred and Ginger said</a>,
“Tomato. Tomato.”]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tools have a horrifically complicated set of dependencies.</p>

    <p>This is partly because formal verification is not quite popular
enough for enough Debian/Homebrew packages to exist and partly
because we need some very specific versions.
(It may also be possible to remove some dependencies!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-verifier">Crux-MIR</a> support to the library
and tool.
Crux-MIR is a new part of Galois’
<a href="https://galois.com/project/software-analysis-workbench/">Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)</a>
that verifies the MIR code generated by the Rust compiler.</p>

    <p>This is taking us a bit longer than using KLEE
because the functionality of our <code>cargo-verify</code> script
overlaps with the functionality of Crux-MIR but they have slightly different
approaches – we’re still working on the best way to handle the resulting
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to focus our attention on a single crate at a time.
We have some ideas for how to do that with fuzzing and verification
but we have not had a chance to try them yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not looked seriously at how well this approach scales.</p>

    <p>The collections support in the <code>propverify</code> library has a few
tricks to avoid some obvious scaling issues, but we don’t know if
those tricks work well for all verification tools and they
probably only scratch the surface of what needs to be done.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing and formal verification are usually portrayed as mortal enemies.
I think that misses a huge opportunity to use your existing familiarity and
comfort with testing to let you get value out of formal verification tools.</p>

<p>I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">our library and tool</a>,
try it out and give us feedback.
If you are working on a Rust verification tool, we would love it
if you tried to use our library with your tool.
And we would love it even more if you sent us a pull request.</p>

<p>It’s probably not a good idea to commit to using the library at this stage:
it is not very robust at the moment and I expect that it will change a lot
as we gain experience from porting the library to other types of
formal verification tools.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<section>
			<p>When we are storing data, we typically assume that our storage system of choice returns that data later just as we put it in.
However what guarantees do we have that this is actually the case?
The case made here is the case of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-bit-rot-and-how-can-i-detect-it-rhel">bitrot</a>, the silent degradation of the physical charges that physically make up today’s storage devices.</p>
<p>To counter this type of problem, one can employ data checksumming, as it is done by both btrfs and ZFS.
However, while in the long run btrfs might be the tool of choice for this, it is fairly complex and not yet too mature, whereas ZFS, the most prominent candidate for this type of features, is <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/8314">not</a> <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/">without</a> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/zfs-licensing-and-linux">hassle</a> and it must be recompiled for every kernel update (although <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Custom-Packages">automation exists</a>).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we’ll therefore take a look into a storage design that actually checks whether the returned data is actually valid and not silently corrupted inside our storage system and is completely designed with components available in Linux itself without the need to recompile and test your storage layer on every kernel upgrade.
We find that this storage design, while fulfilling the same purpose as ZFS, does not only yield comparable performance, but actually in some cases even able to significantly outperform it, as the benchmarks at the end indicate.</p>

<p>The system we will test in the following will be constructed from four components (including the filesystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dm-integrity</strong> provides blocklevel checksumming for all incoming data and will check said checksum for all data read through it (and return a read error if it doesn’t match).</li>
<li><strong>mdraid</strong> provides redundancy if a disk misbehaves, avoiding data loss. If the dm-integrity-layer detects invalid data from the disk, mdraid will see a read-error and can immediately correct this error by reading it from somewhere else in the redundancy pool.</li>
<li><strong>dm-crypt</strong> on top of the RAID, right below the filesystem will encrypt the data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>ext4</strong> as a filesystem to actually store files on it</li>
</ul>
<p>The order matters, dm-integrity must be placed between the harddisks and the mdraid, to ensure that data corruption errors can be corrected by mdraid after they have been detected by dm-integrity. Similarly, dm-crypt has nothing to do with redundancy, therefore it should be placed on top of of mdraid, to only having to be passed once, and not multiple times as it would be the case for placing it alongside dm-integrity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This yields the following storage design:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Storage system architecture</h4>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/mkstorage.sh.txt">This script will assemble the above depicted system and mount it to /mnt.</a></p>

<p>Now that we have an assembled system, we’d like to quantify the performance impact of the different layers.
The test setup for this is a <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Kobol Helios4</a> (primarily because it’s the intended target platform for this storage system) with four disks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> running Debian 10 “Buster”.
The Helios4 is powered by an energy efficient dual-core ARM SoC optimized for storage systems.
The setup was not built based on the entire disks, but on partitions of a size of 10GiB each, allowing multiple parallel designs and therefore easing the benchmarking procedure, as well as speeding up the experiments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="layer-analysis-of-performance-impact">Layer analysis of performance impact</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>To benchmark throughput, the following commands were used:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=8000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure was repeated ten times for proper statistics for the different cases for both read (<code>r</code>) and write (<code>w</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4 filesystem only (<code>f</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>encryption, topped by ext4 (<code>cf</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>mdraid (RAID6/double parity), topped by the former (<code>rcf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
<li>the final setup, including integrity (<code>ircf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layers.svg" alt="Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see different interesting results in the data:
First of all, the encryption engine on the helios4 is not completely impact free, although the resulting performance is still more than sufficient for the designated uses for a Helios4.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see that adding integrity layer does have a noticable impact on writing, but a negligible impact on reading, indicating that especially for systems primarily intended to read data from adding the integrity layer is a matter of negligible cost.</p>
<p>For write-heavy systems, the performance impact is more considerable, but for certain workloads, such as the home-NAS-case the Helios is designed for, the performance can still be considered fully sufficient, especially as normally the system would cache those writes to a certain extend, which was explicitly disabled for benchmarking purposes (see <code>conv=fdatasync</code> in the benchmark procedure).</p>
<p>The reason for the degradation in write (but not in read) is likely due to the fact that the integrity layer and the mdraid layer are decoupled from one another, the raid-layer is not aware that for a double parity setup it effectively has to write the same information three times, and the integrity layer has to account for all three writes before the data is considered synced as required by <code>conv=fdatasync</code>.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>We have found that the throguhput of such a storage design is yielding useful throughput-rates.
The next question is about the latency of the system, which we will, for simplicity, only estimate for random 4K-reads.
Again, just as above, we will investigate the impact of the different layers of the system.
To do so, we read 100.000 sectors randomly from an 18GB sized testfile filling the storage mountpoint for each configuration after dropping all caches.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Latency comparison of system layers</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layerlatencies.svg" alt="Distribution of latencies in milliseconds for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system. green denotes the median, black denotes the average of the latencies of the respective setup, access times below 1ms were considered cache hits and therefore excluded for the computation of mean and average.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure above yields several interesting insights:
First of all, we do see cache hits close to zero milliseconds, furthermore, we see that the latency distribution is fairly evenly distributed over the available range and finally and most interestingly, we see that the impact of the several layers onto the latency is measurable, but rather irrellevant for typical practical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-comparison-with-zfs">Performance comparison with ZFS</h2>
<p>So far we have tested the setup on its intended target platform, the Helios4.
To compare the resulting system against the elephant in the room, ZFS, we will use a different test platform, based on an Intel i7-2600K as CPU and 4x1TB disks, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> was not reliably buildable on Debian Buster on ARM, and when it actually built, it explicitly stated that 32bit-processors (as the Helios’ CPU) are not supported by upstream, although technically the system would run.</p>
<p>To allow for a cleaner comparison, the testbed was accordinly changed to accomodate for ZFS’s preferences.
As ZFS did not adhere to <code>conv=fdatasync</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the main memory was restricted to 1GB, swap was turned off and the size of the testfile was chosen to be 18GB.
This way, any caching happening would be at least significantly reduced as there was little space next to the OS inside of the main memory for caching.</p>
<p>All tests were run on a Debian 10 “Buster” with Linux 4.19, ZFS was used in form of the package <code>zfs-dkms</code> in version 0.8.2 from backports.
The storage layer for both setups was layouted with double parity (RAID6/raidz2) and, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> package in Debian was not able to do encryption, the mdraid-based setup was also setup without the encryption layer.</p>
<h3 id="throughput-1">Throughput</h3>
<p>The commands used for benchmarking throughput were conceptually the same as above:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=18000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>Although ZFS seemingly does not adhere to any cache dropping or syncing instructions, they were still performed and adhered to by the mdraid-based setup.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput comparison, zfs &amp; md</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-md-throughput.svg" alt="Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-testbed.txt">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The results are very interesting: While the md-based setup performs less consistent in and of itself, it still consistently outperforms ZFS in read performance.
When it comes to write, though, ZFS performs noticably better.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To investigate the cause of this unexpected balance, we note that while ZFS combines raid, integrity and filesystem in one component, for the md-based setup these are separate components.
Of these components, not only the filesystem, but also the <code>dm-integrity</code> implements journalling to avoid inconsistencies in case of a power outage.
This leads to increased work until the transaction has been fully flushed to disk, which can be seen in the next figure, where the md-based system (without the encryption layer) is tested with both journalling enabled and disabled in the integrity layer:</p>

<p>So for a while I had a scraper running, which, once a day, scraped housing prices from chosen regions in Germany.
I accumulated about 6 month of data until I stopped it, mainly because I didn’t feel like I’d ever properly utilise it.</p>
<p>I decided to at least show some of it.
This post is basically excerpts from a Jupyter notebook.
A link to the data can be found at the end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small side-note: The diagrams in this post are best viewed in day mode. Sorry, fellow night-moders🌑</p>

<p>The data was split into one newline delimited JSON per day.

Let’s focus on the important bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the dimensions to group by will be time. So we format the <code>crawl_time</code> into <code>datetime</code>.</li>
<li><code>area_total</code> somtimes contains prices. Talk about messy, so we filter that</li>
<li><code>price_num</code> contains decimal signs, € signs and also ranges. We replace as much as we can, but ranges will be dropped altogether.</li>
<li><code>room_number</code> usually contains the rooms twice, so we regexp the first number.</li>

<p>Since I’m a data engineer, and much more about collection and providing data, than about analysing, I will do exactly what I do best and provide the data.
I packed it all into one JSON, instead of many, and compressed it with 7z.</p>

<p>If you do anything nice with it, feel free to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/Milchdealer">twitter🧑‍💻</a>.</p>

<p>What did I learn?
First of all, I’m not much of a data scientist.
While I do have ideas of what else I could with the data, it does not really motivate me to keep on going.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, one could split out prices by area, rooms, city center or suburbs, …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working with pandas also does not feel entirely intuiative to me, mostly because most of data wrangling I usually do between low-level languages and python.
And whenever I really do want to display some results, I fall back to tables and excel.
Which admittedly works fine for pretty much all my use-cases.
And although it’s nice to try out new things, sticking to what you love to do usually yields in more fun.
Especially for side projects!😃</p>
<p>So, look forward to that. Still, this might not be my last dip into dataframes, notebooks and plotting.</p>

			<p>This Blogpost will investigate the impact of different power management policies for SATA devices in Linux with regard to their power consumption as well as their performance impact.
Because after all, everyone likes to get more battery life for free, right?</p>
<p>We will briefly discuss the test setup, then take a look at several measurement results for both power and performance to at the end take a look how to leverage the found results in practice.</p>
<p>Overall, we will find that for SSDs the power management policies for SATA devices can make a significant difference in power consumption while having a negligible impact on performance at the same time.</p>

<p>On a modern linux machine, several modes for power management of a SATA drive are available.
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scsi/link_power_management_policy.txt">These are</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>max_performance</strong>: A disk is typically kept awake and running to get the best performance out of it. This is most indicative when thinking about spinning disks, as a spindown leads to inevitable significant latencies for the next access of the drive</li>
<li><strong>min_power</strong>: This mode prefers power saving over maximum performance. For spinning disks this for example implies spindowns to save power</li>
<li><strong>medium_power</strong>: A compromise between the aforementioned two.</li>
<li><strong>med_power_with_dipm</strong>: This mode configures the drive like <code>medium_power</code> does, but with additional Device Initiated Power Management. <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/830838/">It uses the same configuration the Intel IRST Windows driver uses to for drives</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The measurement was performed on laptops and their internal SSDs.
Due to availability to the author, the measurements were done with a <strong>Crucial M550</strong> and a <strong>Crucial MX500</strong>, both 1TB in size.
Measurements were taken with</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux 5.3</li>
<li>no applications opened (except for the terminal with the benchmarking process)</li>
<li>screen turned off (only really relevant for power)</li>
<li>standard system daemons still running</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="power-consumption">Power consumption</h2>
<p>The power consumption measurements were done using <a href="https://github.com/cherti/sata-power-consumption">this code</a>, to further reduce noise, wifi was disabled as well.
After the link power management policy was set, the system was let idling for 10 minutes to reduce any influences from other policies or activities from before.
Afterwards, power consumpiton was measured over 15 minutes via the <code>/sys</code>-API of the machine’s battery controller.
It was read every three seconds.</p>
<p>Three scenarios were tested for all available link power management policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>idle</strong>: no induced activity</li>
<li><strong>synchronous</strong>: activity right before reading the current power consumption</li>
<li><strong>asynchronous</strong>: activity in the middle of two power measurements</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire procedure was repeated for all combinations of available link power management policies and scenarios (so in total 12 times).</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>After setting the link power management policy and let the system idle to ensure measurements would not be influenced by past activity.
Idle time was chosen to be 15 minutes (slightly longer as for power, an additional precaution as the performance measurements were significantly shorter time-wise that the power measurements).
Performance was then measured using <code>fio</code> 3.16 with <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/sata-power-consumption/ssd-test.fio.txt">this preset</a> adapted from <a href="https://github.com/axboe/fio/blob/master/examples/ssd-test.fio">here</a> using <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/sata-power-consumption/measure_performance.txt">this script</a>.
As benchmarking is hard, the performance measurements are not intended to be an absolute statement of the drive’s performance, but rather intended as a ballpark measurement to get a feel for the performance impact of different link power management policies.</p>

<h2 id="performance-1">Performance</h2>
<p>The measurements for the MX500 were very consistent when repeatedly measured.
The measurements for the M550 were a bit flakey, so the fio-measurement on the M550 was performed three times and the performance characteristics shown are the respective medians over all three measurements for both throughput and latency.</p>

<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>Latency information was gathered as part of the <code>fio</code>-measurements for the different link power management policies.
The results (specifically <code>lat</code> in fio’s output) are denoted as <code>average +/- standard deviation</code> in microseconds to, again, get a ballpark estimate.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the results clearly indicate, the power link management policy has a noticable impact on a computer’s power consumption, up to a third of its total under light load when we exclude the screen.
The newest mode <code>med_power_with_dipm</code> proves to be both among the lowest consuming ones for all modes for the tested SSD models and also very consistent in this, whereas other modes are either equal, systematically higher or highly dependent of the scenario at play (for example the <code>min_power</code> mode on the MX500).</p>
<p>The performance impact, both in latency and in throughput, was, however, somewhere between measurable and completely negligible, the highest impact could be seen in the throughput of the M550 where the data still implies <code>med_power_with_dipm</code> to be the preferred choice.</p>
<p>Beware that the results in this post are only applicable to SSDs.
HDDs might have significantly different performance and power characteristics due to spin-down and spin-up times and other factors.
Furthermore, the aforementioned results will likely apply for SSDs in general, but were obviously only tested on certain models.
Different models, especially from differend vendors, could have different characteristics.</p>

<p>If you want to check which policy is in place, you can take a look at the content of the files <code>/sys/class/scsi_host/host[0-9]/link_power_management_policy</code>, which indicate the applied policy or simply use</p>
<pre><code>cat /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy
</code></pre>
<p>to see the policies. After all, if you didn’t configure anything, they should all be the same, so you’ll see what’s configured no matter which disk it is.
To automatically set the desired policy, you can create a file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/disk-power.rules</code> containing:</p>
<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM=="scsi_host", KERNEL=="host*", ATTR{link_power_management_policy}="med_power_with_dipm"
</code></pre>
<p>that will set <code>med_power_with_dipm</code> for all SATA disks that will show up.
Alternatively, if you use <code>tlp</code>, you don’t have to do anything, because (at least in the default configuration) <code>tlp</code> does already take care of setting this policy, at least for the primary SATA disk.</p>

<h3 id="liteonit-lcs-256-256gb">Liteonit LCS-256, 256GB</h3>
<p>One additional dataset was donated from an additional SSD, specifically a <strong>Liteonit LCS-256</strong>, sized at 256GB.
Below you find the power measurements for this disk, the measurement procedure is roughly equal to the one outlined for Crucial’s MX500 and M550 above.
We see that, while the exact numbers vary, the power profiles behave very similar, specifically to the ones of the MX500, and our conclusions apply for this disk as well.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>03 Sep 2020</span></p><p>Benefits of a mono-repo, based on experience from working at Netflix, Blippar,
and Aurora.</p>

<p>The point of a company-wide monorepo is so that your fact-finding efforts at
development time require navigating a chain of code vs navigating a chain of
people.</p>

<p>Walking through code is much more self-reliant and fast, given you CAN still
talk to people and ask questions.</p>

<p>No matter how professional, responsible and courteous your developers are at
maintaining documentation and answering queries from other teams, there is still
a human cost for someone to reach out in person.</p>

<p>That cost comes in the forms of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Requests to access code.</li>
  <li>Unnecessary invites on the calendar.</li>
  <li>Queries about what’s deployed or not, relevant or not, deprecated or about to
be.</li>
  <li>Hunting for real-world examples of usage of code across the company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another clear benefit is to have a singular technological backbone for the whole
company (or large team). Here’s what that does:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Infrastructure cost gets consolidated, easier to reason about.</li>
  <li>Frontend and backend code become less defensive, and more open to broader
changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>And benefits aren’t just technological, but also organizational (thx @methodiva)</p>

<p>A monorepo inherently discourages code fiefdoms, and hits the sweet spot of
feeling ownership, where you feel ownership and responsibility for the whole
product, instead of your little castle in it.</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://dev.vamsirao.com/vs-code-extensions | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dev.vamsirao.com/vs-code-extensions">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599156332456/7WwIJcqD0.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We all use some VS Code extensions for our day to day development and are always on a hunt for more useful extensions. Here is a list of mine and how I use them:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.peacockcode.dev/">Peacock</a> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593585542633/58FKxSF2u.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt=""></p>
<p>We have all been there when we have two editors open and coded in the wrong one 🤦  Peacock helps me differentiate between different workspaces by setting a different color theme to VS Code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/activeScopeBorder.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easily distinguishable bracket scopes are always good for programming and this extension does it well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/printscreen-select-lines.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you are in the flow but navigating the code from one function to another becomes tedious, this lets you bookmark code at different lines and you can easily access it using shortcuts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There have been times when I have embarrassingly spent more time than needed debugging an error only to find out it was a spelling mistake. This extension keeps that in check.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auiworks.amvim">AmVim</a></p>
<p> I am a huge fan of Vim, it legit increases your productivity without having to touch the trackpad. AmVim is one of the Vim mode extension for VSCode, I found this to be quite good and not bloaty compared to other Vim extensions.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">Settings Sync</a></p>
<p>Settings Sync helps you keep the same environment of VSCode (extensions and preferences) across machines.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log">Turbo Console log</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dysw7p/insert_log_message.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is really useful while debugging, it helps create meaningful logs using shortcuts. All you have to do is highlight the variable and press the keybindings.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode">Tab Nine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/raw/master/assets/tabnine.gif" alt="sdfsdf"></p>
<p>I just recently came across this one in one of <a href="https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips">Chris Bongers</a>'s article. Really like it! It is sometimes just scary how accurately it predicts auto-completion (It uses deep-learning model locally on your machine to come up with the predictions).</p>
<hr><p>
Other than these I use the common ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon theme</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight">Color Highlight</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wart.ariake-dark">Ariake Dark</a> is my VS Code theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope you found this useful and feel free to share the extensions you use in the comments below. You can also @ me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vamsirao7">twitter</a></p>

<p>How much does running a webapp in production actually cost? Maybe more than you think. Keepthescore.co is a Python flask application running on DigitalOcean and Firebase. It currently has around 55k unique visitors per month, per day it’s around 3.4k.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/money-tree.jpg" alt="A money tree">

<p>Here’s a monthly breakdown with some background information on each cost:</p>

<h3 id="servers-and-database-on-digitalocean">Servers and database on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $95</strong></p>

<p>The webapp runs on two identical DigitalOcean servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 80GB disk). We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>, which is a great way of running and hosting a webapp (more on that in a future post) but it does mean that you need 2 identical production servers.</p>

<p>The database is a hosted Postgres instance also on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Note: the servers are oversized for the load we’re currently seeing. The reason for that is that we tried to solve a production issue by increasing the server specs. It didn’t solve the problem, and now we can’t down-size the servers without re-provisioning them 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="code-repo-on-github">Code repo on GitHub</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $0</strong></p>

<p>This is free. Thanks GitHub!
</p><hr>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $60</strong></p>

<p>We use a reporting tool called <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to generate insights and reports from the database. The tool itself is opensource and free, but hosting it is fairly expensive. Currently it runs on an EC2 instance. There are definitely some savings that could be realised here.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $1.32</strong></p>

<p>We use Firebase for the <a href="https://keepthescore.co/basketball-scoreboard/">realtime basketball scoreboard</a>. We also use the Google Sheets API for some custom scoreboards. Overall it must be said that the Google Cloud APIs are great value for money (so far).</p>

<p>We have plans to move away from DigitalOcean and onto Google Cloud infrastructure in the next year.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="dns-hosting">DNS hosting</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $5</strong></p>

<p>Our domain is registered with <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple.com</a>.
</p><hr>



<p><strong>Costs per month: $10</strong></p>

<p>Scoreboards and this blog have the option of allowing a discussion on the same page – this uses the <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> service. Disqus has a free tier but they began showing ads so we were forced to move to the paid tier.</p>

<p>We are planning to move to <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a> in the future, which is cheaper, has no ads, and respects your privacy.
</p><hr>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-it-is-there-revenue">Is it worth it? Is there revenue?</h2>

<p>In total that’s around <strong>$171 USD per month</strong>. If you’re running a company with employees that would be peanuts, but in this case the cost is being borne by a single indie-developer out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is that on the revenue side there’s a big fat zero. This is the reason why we are currently working on monetization. This will include banner ads and payments via Stripe. Expect to see these features land by next week! Anyway, more about that in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-spending-way-too-much-money">You are spending way too much money!</h2>

<p>This post generated an interesting discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24372084">Hacker News</a>. One recurring theme
was that our stack is large and expensive and that we could massively reduce costs.</p>

<p>This is true. But here are some things that are also true:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Reducing costs” is not our primary objective at the moment: time is more valuable than money right now.</li>
<li>Our primary objective right now is velocity of product development.</li>
<li>We are not devops experts and optimizing operations takes time.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a follow up post once we do optimize our stack.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and so long, 👋</p>

<p>20 years ago, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eksisozluk.com/" target="_blank">Eksisozluk</a> was founded in 1999 by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/esesci" target="_blank">Sedat (ssg) Kapanoglu</a>. At the time that it was built, it was unique online platform in terms of its format in Turkey. According to the founder, Eksisozluk idea came from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” which is written by Douglas Adams. The idea was an online dictionary where the people would contribute by defining any term or word they want to. Eksi sozluk’s (means “Sour dictionary”) motto was “Kutsal bilgi kaynağı” can be translated to “The holy source of the knowledge”. But that declaration actually was a humor. Because the main purpose of Eksisozluk was to having fun and socialize. Every definition of a word or term was called “entry”. Entries did not need to be correct. People could do irony or write incorrect things intentionally to have fun about words or terms if they want to. Entries completely depends on author’s way of thinking about terms and things. The main rule was “whatever you want to write, you have to define the term first, then you can continue to write as you wish.”  If we want to give a comparative example, you can think Eksisozluk as mixture of the reddit and the wikipedia but in plain text only. Eksisozluk was gaining popularity over the time since its start.</p>



<p>For its 20th anniversary, I decided to bring back the original Eksi Sozluk to the life to celebrate its 20th b-day. And you will able to experience the early version of Eksisozluk your own. If you want to do this now you can follow this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://sourtimes.oguzkartal.net/info.html" target="_blank">link</a>. But naturally it’s language is in Turkish only. Also I pushed this project’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/0ffffffffh/sozluk-cgi-revival" target="_blank">source code</a> to my github account.  So this article will be containing the journey about how I done it. </p>



<p>In February 2015, Eksisozluk founder had published the original source code of Eksisozluk. It was the very early sample of its source code. After couple of months, that source caught my interest. I was very curious about how Eksisozluk was looked at that time because I was a child and naturally I did not know anything about it. I didn’t even have a computer at that time. So I pulled the source from its github <a href="https://github.com/ssg/sozluk-cgi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">repo</a>. The early version of Eksisozluk had written in Delphi to be running as a CGI application. The CGI was quite popular technology to build web applications at those times. Of course the CGI remains very ancient technology today’s standards. But the major Http servers are still supports the CGI applications. Even, they were brought some enhancements to it like Fast-CGI etc. To be able run the source I had to compile it. When I inspect the project file I saw that it was developed with the Delphi 4. I wanted to compile with same version of the Delphi compiler. So I compiled and tried for the first run. I ran it under Apache Http server (httpd) 2.0 and Windows 2000 as the OS. I did it because I wasn’t sure about possible compatibility issues.  (Later I tested the compiled executables under Windows 10  and these are worked without any compatibility issue)  </p>



<p>It was worked well except a small logic problem in it. I fixed and sent a pull request. So he (ssg) accepted my pull request gracefully. That was my first attempt to work with the original eksi sozluk code.</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz.png 944w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz-300x222.png 300w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz-768x567.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>The initial version of the Ekşi Sözlük and its very first entry, “Pena”. It became very popular in its community.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After 3 years the time was going to a remarkable milestone for Ekşi Sözlük. And I decided to do something for it. I wanted to bring the experience as same as the Eksi Sozluk at that time to the people. This was also “for fun” job for me. So I started this. Before starting this project I set one rule to myself.</p>



<p><em><strong>Whatever I do, I will not change anything from the original source and the technology that it based on.</strong></em></p>



<p>Why? Because I want to let people to use early version of Eksisozluk as completely same as its original code and binaries. This project will be run on the same code as of 1999. Yeah that sounds quite fantastic but that brought a lot of things to overcome for me. However, I have to bring some “must have” features to Eksi Sozluk CGI on the fly. Such as pagination support. The original Eksi Sozluk hadn’t any pagination support. Whole topics and entries were placed on the same page. That’s inefficient way to operate today.  I have done it without changing any html file for sake of the originality.  Let’s begin to meeting the original eksi sozluk’s architecture. </p>



<h3>Everything was stored in a text file as plaintext.</h3>



<p>Did you surprised?  But It was fairly enough to operate the service at the time. Because the early Eksi Sozluk was known by quite limited amount of people. And the most of them, they were friends of each other. These friendships would have came from the real life or from common IRC channels etc. Remaining people were usually friend of those core users. I thought the active registered users were nothing more than 500 at that time. On the other hand, the internet access in turkey at the time was also rare and the internet users weren’t online oftenly. So request and entry addition rates were too low to handle. </p>



<p>The first Eksi sozluk was kept the records in a plain text file like a phone book. Each different type of record was placed in different text file.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project8.png 450w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project8-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"><figcaption>The original architecture of the Eksi Sozluk</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The diagram above shows you the architecture simply.  Every user requests were caught by the Http server then passed to the corresponding process. Cgi processes are responsible to handle the raw request. </p>



<p>Eksi sozluk’s logic were separated into several processes to prevent the source become too complex. But it had common core routines (called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ssg/sozluk-cgi/blob/master/common.pas" target="_blank">common.pas</a>) that shared across the processes. Whole records input and output operations were done by sequential file read and write operations. There were two major text files. First is, the dict.txt. Dict.txt was a text file that the entries was stored. Second was user.txt. User.txt was the file for the users information. Fun part about that, the people who were registered earlier, they were experienced faster eksi sozluk than others. Because their user authentication was done quick because of their records were at the beginning of the user.txt :) Of course that delay was in the scale of the milliseconds except user.txt with 10.000 records :P. It would be really pain in the ass if user.txt had thousands of records. The user records made by 3 lines. First line was for user name (Users were called as Suser means “Sozluk User” as far I know), Second was for password in plain text. Yes, but don’t judge. That approach was not too deadly sin at the time. The actual horrible thing is even today, some giant services still store the passwords in plaintext. Anyway, the third line was for e-mail addresses.  Every new record (users, entries etc) was marked with ~ (Tilde) character. That would have pointed to the beginning of the new record. Same thing also correct for dict.txt. In perspective for dict.txt, the first line was for baslik (means topic), the second was for Suser nickname, third was for entry addition date, and the fourth was for the entry.  The term “entry” was used as is. I don’t know why but there was an inverse situation about the terms. baslik (topic) was used as in Turkish, but the entires were called as “entry” (means “girdi” in Turkish) instead of it’s Turkish form. Probably the word “girdi” was not good to hear. Anyway, you can take a look to the original dict.txt content and it’s structure by clicking <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ssg/sozluk-cgi/blob/master/dict.txt" target="_blank">here</a> if you want. </p>



<h3>Bringing back this ancient system to this day.</h3>



<p>The original architecture is obsolete and  it’s almost impossible to operate correctly in today’s standards, technology, bandwidth and online internet user capacity.  Of course you can still run it for your own with just throwing executables and html files into httpd’s work directories but that’s all. But you have to still be aware to your modern browser’s behavior. If your modern browser send anything that the sozluk-cgi does not love, you may get unwanted results :)) </p>



<p>So what I had to do? First I had to eliminate the direct file I/O access to the files then redirect all read write operations to a modern backend. To achieve that, I had to intercept executable’s native File I/O APIs. Sozluk-cgi was used Delphi runtime I/O functions (Internal buffering, caching etc) but eventually they were reach to the Windows file I/O APIs such as (CreateFile, WriteFile, CloseFile etc). After that, these intercepted I/O calls should be analyzed and converted into correct request packets. To do that, I had to study on the Eksi sozluk CGI code. Because to be handle the native I/Os as a request I should know what write read sequences corresponds which type of request or operation. I will be detailed later about this process. After translation of the requests there should be a backend system to handle requests, a database server to be store data efficiently and even a in-memory cache solution to reduce database I/Os. I drew a sketch in my mind about the new architecture for this. And after job done, the system’s structure became this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93.png 800w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93-300x225.png 300w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>The new architecture of the sozluk-cgi</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, there is a hooking layer to make bridge between cgi processes and the backend. The bridge layer is supported by the translation layer which is translates native read write sequences into its simple transportation format. The bridge is a duplex data transfer path which is based on named pipe. Translated request packets are handled by the request handler. The request handler reads the formatted data and maps into corresponding managed work implementation. The datastore manager is responsible to data models I/O. Datastore works with the cache manager internally. It communicates with the SQL Server and the Cache Manager when it need. Cache Manager is a dealer between Memcached instance and the backend. Registration service is responsible for user registration. Do you know why that services also known as Edi? You don’t? Nop. I will tell on its …</p></div></div>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/tdd-for-legacy-code-mountain.jpg" alt="Drawing of an alpinist in front of an insurmountable mountain 'Mt Legacy Code' with a flag 'TDD' at the top"></p>

<p>A few days ago, a former colleague told me his current team was reluctant to give TDD a chance. Here are the typical comments he heard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Adding a test in this old code is a three weeks task!”</p>

  <p>“All the tests we wrote in this code are mock-ridden, unmaintainable, and useless!”</p>

  <p>“How can we go tests first, when the code is already written?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have worked with teams dealing with legacy code, you must have heard similar complaints.</p>

<h2 id="the-barriers-to-tdd-for-legacy-code">The barriers to TDD for Legacy Code</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/chainlink.jpg" alt="Close up photograph of a chainlink. There are barriers to overcome when starting TDD for Legacy Code"></p>

<p>All these difficulties boil down to two root causes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It’s impossible to write tests before code that was already written.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Legacy code makes everything more complicated. In our case, it increases the learning curve of TDD for the team.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>To get a team dealing with legacy code to do TDD, you’ll need to address these two fundamental barriers.</p>

<p>One option could be to put more pressure on the team: “From now on, TDD is mandatory.” This strategy is not going to work for long. We want a sustainable pace, and the only way to get it is through regular learning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to coach the team to one effective technique to apply TDD in the legacy code context.</li>
  <li>The next step is to leverage this momentum to set up regular practice sessions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-straightforward-technique">A straightforward technique</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/railway.jpg" alt="Photo of a straight railway. It's best to start TDD for Legacy Code with one straightforward but effective technique."></p>

<p>Here is, in my opinion, <strong>the most useful and straightforward TDD for legacy code technique</strong>. Let’s say you need to add a new feature:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Refactor the existing code to introduce an extension-point to host your new feature</li>
  <li>Implement your new feature using TDD. Make it compatible to your extension-point</li>
  <li>Once your new feature is ready, plug it in the legacy code through the extension-point</li>
  <li>Check that the whole thing is working. Use whatever test you have, either manual or automated</li>
  <li>If it’s not working as you expect, repeat the whole cycle (adapt extension point, TDD your new feature…)</li>
</ol>

<p>All this might sound very easy in theory. Unfortunately, it can get pretty complicated in practice! Before trying this in production code, it’s a good idea to practice and learn. Let’s see how to do that!</p>

<h2 id="the-gilded-rose-kata">The Gilded Rose Kata</h2>

<p>The gilded rose is a famous kata to practice refactoring techniques. I am going to use it to illustrate the above plan.</p>

<p>The gilded rose is an inventory management function. The goal of the kata is to manage a new kind of item: conjured items. Conjured items behave like standard items, except that they age twice as fast. You can check <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt">the full instructions on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into the code!</p>

<h3 id="refactoring-to-an-extension-point">Refactoring to an extension-point</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/plug.jpg" alt="Photo of a plug on a blueprint. An effective first step to start TDD for Legacy Code is to refactor legacy code to make it easy to inject new features"></p>

<p>The first step in our plan is to change the existing code before injecting our new feature. This step can be tricky as it touches the legacy code, and we don’t want to break anything. Here are a few principles to cut risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stick to the smallest possible change</li>
  <li>Use any validation technique you have at your disposal:
    <ul>
      <li>End to end tests</li>
      <li>Manual tests</li>
      <li>Integration tests</li>
      <li>Setting up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test">Golden Master test</a> for the occasion is also a smart move.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use many pairs of eyes. <strong>Refactoring in pair or mob will drastically reduce the risk for regression.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the gilded rose kata comes with a golden master test. It’s a test that “snapshots” the behavior of your code to let you refactor it. It’s temporary because a precise snapshot is unmaintainable. You can learn more about the golden master technique through this live refactoring.</p>

<p>The gilded rose kata uses the <a href="https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp">ApprovalTests.cpp</a> library to help us with Golden Master testing. All we need to do is to add a set of test combination to the existing test:</p>

<p>Now that we have a regression test, we are ready to change the existing code, so let’s try to add an extension point. One way to do this is to add an array of ‘item updaters’ that can take care of specific types of items.</p>

<h4 id="cppsrcgildedroseh"><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/cpp/src/GildedRose.h">cpp/src/GildedRose.h</a></h4>

<p>The first thing we’ll do is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an ItemUpdater abstract class</li>
  <li>Add a list of ItemUpdater objects to the GildedRose constructor</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span><span>ItemUpdater</span><span>();</span>

    <span>virtual</span> <span>bool</span> <span>handles</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>Item</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>(</span><span>Item</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>class</span> <span>GildedRose</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>items</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>shared_ptr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>itemUpdaters</span><span>;</span>
    <span>GildedRose</span><span>(</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>items</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>shared_ptr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>itemUpdaters</span><span>);</span>
    
    <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>();</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>(</span><span>Item</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll just need to adapt the constructor calls from the tests with an empty array of ItemUpdaters <code>{}</code>.</p>

<h4 id="cppsrcgildedrosecc"><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/cpp/src/GildedRose.cc">cpp/src/GildedRose.cc</a></h4>

<p>In the implementation, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Store the ItemUpdater objects</li>
  <li>Extract an <code>updateQuality(Item&amp;)</code> method to handle a single item</li>
  <li>Delegate to an ItemUpdater that can handle a particular item</li>
</ul>

<p>It is now possible to inject an implementation for conjured items.</p>

<h3 id="code-conjured-items-with-tdd">Code conjured items with TDD</h3>

<p>The implementation of our extension point needs to deal with two aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declare that it will handle conjured items</li>
  <li>update quality and sellIn for a conjured item</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>
    <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedDoubleArrayMap</span><span>,</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span>
    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>       A JSArray object                      A FixedArray object

  <div>
    
    <p>Earlier this year, we contributed a driver for the Input/Output Memory
Management Unit (IOMMU) introduced with the Allwinner H6 SoCs in Linux,
that got merged in Linux 5.8. It felt like a good occasion to write
about what an IOMMU is, what it’s useful for and how it integrates into
Linux.</p>

<p>At the low-level, a CPU executes an infinite sequence of instructions,
some of them either reading or writing to an address in memory.
Depending on the system design, the hardware maps that address to the
main RAM of the system, or to a specific device. The set of all the
memory addresses than the CPU can access is the memory space.</p>
<p>In older or simpler designs, the CPU accesses directly the physical
location on the memory bus of a memory word or register, the physical
address. This simple design is still in use on some micro-controllers
today, but it introduces some issues related to security, and
reliability.</p>
<p>Indeed, that design doesn’t enforce any isolation between processes or
permission checks. This means that any process in the system has
read/write access to the entire memory in the system, including the
kernel and other applications. This could lead to a system-wide memory
corruption if a buggy application starts to write at some random place
in memory. And this is the ideal scenario: indeed, it also allowed any
process to snoop on any memory stored by another process or the kernel,
leading to potential sensitive information leaks if that process was
malicious.</p>
<p>To fix that issue, CPU designs introduced a hardware unit called the
Memory Management Unit (MMU) that intercepts all the memory accesses
done by the CPU once enabled and translates them. This mechanism allows
to have two distinct address spaces: the physical address space that we
talked about earlier, and a virtual address space that the CPU operates
on, the MMU being in charge of translating the virtual addresses into
physical addresses when the CPU access them.</p>
<p>The best part is that the kernel can change the virtual address space
anytime, so it actually uses one virtual address space per process (and
potentially one for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">kernel</a>). In
addition, the MMU also allows to set extra attributes to carry out
access control over memory ranges, allowing to change whether we want to
allow the associated process to read, write, or execute the data stored
in a particular range.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows the kernel to prevent any process to messing with
the memory of another process at the hardware level, almost entirely
closing the class of attacks we mentioned earlier, and enables
the operating system to provide more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_virtual_memory_management">optimizations</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">features</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it looks complete, there’s a limitation though: the MMU
translates the addresses used by the <strong>CPU</strong>. Yet, some devices can also
access memory directly without the CPU intervention using a feature
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</a>,
and since the CPU isn’t involved, the MMU isn’t either. This means that we’re
still vulnerable to the same class of issues than the one we described earlier
if we perform a misconfigured DMA operation or if an attacker
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack">manages</a> to trick a device
into reading some other parts of the memory than the one it’s supposed
to access. As an example of such an attack, you can find an in-depth
article explaining how the Google Project Zero team was able to pull
this off on a Nexus 6 modem
<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To close that channel of attacks, system designers later integrated
IOMMUs, that fill pretty much the same needs and with the same features
than regular MMUs, but providing that translation and protection to
devices that perform DMA instead of the CPU. It’s not unusual to even
have several IOMMUs: the GPU almost always has its own, and then there
would be another one for the rest or a subset of the devices in the
system.</p>
<p>IOMMUs also allow to address a common issue where the device isn’t able
to access the entirety of the buffer for some reason. It mainly happens
either when the buffer it’s supposed to perform DMA on isn’t contiguous
in physical memory and is thus split between some chunks while the
device can solely perform DMA on a single chunk; or when the device
can’t access the buffer location in RAM due to some limitations. One
common limitation would be that devices can just access the lowest 4 GB
of the RAM (since it’s addressable on 32 bits), while the system might
have more than that. Either way, the way to deal with that situation is
to create a <em>bounce buffer</em>: a temporary buffer that the device can
access and where we’re going to copy the content of the original buffer
to so that the device can access it. There’s an obvious performance cost
to it though, since we could introduce a copy of the whole buffer before
the device can operate on it. Still, IOMMUs save the day once again
since you can basically create any mapping, both accommodating the
non-contiguous case by creating a mapping where the virtual buffer would
be contiguous, and using a virtual address that the device can access.</p>

<h2 id="the-iommu-framework">The IOMMU Framework</h2>
<p>Since an IOMMU is so useful, Linux gained support for IOMMUs using a
dedicated driver framework under <strong>drivers/iommu</strong>. That framework uses
three different concepts to enforce permissions as fine-grained as
possible for a given device: domains, groups, and devices.</p>
<p>A device is quite straightforward, it’s a device that can perform DMA
operations through our IOMMU, a domain is a representation of a virtual
address space and a group is a set of devices that the IOMMU can’t
isolate from each other. The framework then relies on functions to
manage those three concepts. As you can see in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/iommu.h#n191">the operations that a driver can perform</a>,
all those functions are to manage the relationships between the devices,
groups and domains that the system is going to have, and manage each
individually (to create a mapping in a particular domain for example).</p>
<h2 id="the-dma-api">The DMA API</h2>
<p>The second part of the integration in Linux, once it knows how to
manage the various address spaces through the IOMMU framework and
drivers, is to allow the drivers for the devices that need to perform
DMA to use that IOMMU.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of Linux is to be as portable as possible, and it
does so by abstracting much of the usual driver operations through
frameworks and APIs, and allows to decouple the driver itself (how does
one need to program a device to perform a given operation) from how the
platform works (in our case, how would the platform do DMA, or how
should Linux configure the IOMMU).</p>
<p>DMA is no different here, and Linux has two distinct APIs depending on
the context: the streaming API and the coherent API. As we mentioned
earlier, you would use one over the other depending on the situation
you’re in, and who is in charge of allocating the buffer that gets
accessed through DMA. If the user-space hands the buffer to the driver
(for example when you would send a network packet, or write to a file),
you’d need to setup a temporary mapping through the streaming API. In
other situations though, the kernel would be in charge of allocating the
buffer and then pass that buffer to the user-space—the Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) and Video4Linux2 (v4l2) can operate like that—, and that
would be where you’d need the coherent API.</p>
<p>The two APIs are here to make sure that the device can perform DMA on
the buffer we want to access. They thus make sure that the device can
access the buffer. What it actually means then depends on the platform,
what memory range the device can access, which memory allocator to use,
etc. Part of that decision involves whether the device accesses go
through an IOMMU, which then gets configured properly to create the
mappings for our buffer in the device’s virtual address space.</p>

<p>We contributed to Linux 5.8 a driver for the IOMMU introduced by
Allwinner in their H6 SoC. Compared to the IOMMUs found on modern PCs,
its design is a bit simple: it doesn’t support virtualization, there’s a
single address space, and it doesn’t cover all the devices doing DMA in
the system but solely the DMA intensive ones: the video and display
devices.</p>
<p>The driver thus registers and allows a single domain and group since the
IOMMU can’t isolate devices from one another, and it supports a single
address space. Despite these limitations though, it’s still a welcome
addition for all the reasons above.</p>
<p>Video and display controllers also require a lot of big, contiguous
buffers allocated through the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) on
earlier SoCs. CMA works by putting aside a part of the system RAM at
boot, and allocating big buffers from that area. There’s a big drawback
now though: the system has to maintain a rather big (in the 100 MB
order), static, pool of RAM put aside, no matter if the system is going
to use its video or display capabilities, and without any way to give
the RAM back if it doesn’t. As we discussed, an IOMMU has the capability
to map several, separate, chunks in physical memory to provide a
contiguous buffer in the device virtual space, effectively reducing (or
even removing) the need for CMA.</p>

<p>With Linux 5.8 onward, the Allwinner H6 uses its IOMMU with the DRM
display driver and the Cedrus video decoder driver. As time goes by and
we enable its usage across more drivers, it benefits more devices.
And with any luck, more Allwinner SoCs will feature an IOMMU.</p>

<p><img alt="Libvirt The Unsung Hero of Cloud Computing Platforms" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_the_unsung_hero.png"></p><p>Initially my intention was to write an article on <strong>Round up of open source Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)</strong>, but while doing research found one piece of software library so fundamental, that it holds the key to very existence of Cloud Computing services and platforms as we know it today (that includes Amazon AWS, OpenStack and CloudStack). So I decided to postpone my idea and started to write an article on this <strong>Unsung hero of Cloud Computing</strong> called libvirt <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, which I believe many people won’t have heard of. Obviously talking about software library tend to be technical, so this article will have a technical tone, but I will attempt to make it readable for everyone interested in Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualzation and these APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of Cloud Management Platform. Libvirt makes it possible to control and manage millions of compute nodes, storage and network devices via common programmable interface. Its like being able to control and orchestrate fleet of millions of car irrespective of different manufacturer, model, or engine through a common interface from a single car (it can be more then one car for redundancy and high availability). What started as a management API for Xen, today has been extended to support major components of Cloud Computing platforms.</p>
<div id="libvirt-goals-architecture">
<h2>Libvirt Goals &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>Libvirt defines following terms for its goals <a href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Mapping of libvirt terms to virtualized or containerized physical machine" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_terms_mapping.png"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong> is a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a layer of softeare allowing to virtualize a node in a set of physical machines with possible different configurations that the node itself.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> is an instance of an operating system (or subsystem in case of container virtualization like OpenVZ and lxc) running on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above terms <strong>“The goal of libvirt is to provide a common and stable layer sufficient to securely manage domains on a node, possibly remote”</strong>. So libvirt should provide all APIs needed to do the management, such as: provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate and stop the domains - within the limits of the support of the hypervisor for those operations. This implies following sub-goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API can be carried remotely though secure APIs</li>
<li>While most API will be generic in term of hypervisor or Host OS, some API may be targeted to a single virtualization environment as long as the semantic for the operations from a domain management perspective is clear</li>
<li>the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations needed to manage domains on a node, including resource provisioning and setup</li>
<li>the API will not try to provide high level virtualization policies or multi-nodes management features like load balancing, but the API should be sufficient so they can be implemented on top of libvirt</li>
<li>stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization framework</li>
<li>the node being managed may be on a different physical machine than the management program using libvirt, to this effect libvirt supports remote access, but should only do so by using secure protocols.</li>
<li>libvirt will provide APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and NUMA partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So libvirt is intended to be a building block for higher level management tools and for applications focusing on virtualization of a single node (the only exception being domain migration between node capabilities which involves more than one node).</p>

<h3>Libvirt Driver Based Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt driver based architecture" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_architecture.png"></p><p>Libvirt to support wide variety of hypervisor implements a driver-based architecture. Based on car analogy, it means delegating the actual implementation of control of different cars to the drivers specifically designed for make, model and engine of the specific car. Libvirt currently supports:</p>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>

<li>LXC - Linux Containers</li>
<li>OpenVZ</li>
<li>QEMU</li>
<li>Test - Used for testing</li>

<h3>Libvirt API structure <a href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a></h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_api_structure.png"></p><p>The figure above shows the five main objects exported by the API:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>virConnectPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the connection to a hypervisor. Use one of the virConnectOpen functions to obtain connection to the hypervisor which is then used as a parameter to other connection API’s.</dd>
<dt><strong>virDomainPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one domain either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently running on that node). The function virConnectListAllDomains lists all the domains for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virNetworkPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one network either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently activated). The function virConnectListAllNetworks lists all the virtualization networks for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStorageVolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one storage volume generally used as a block device available to one of the domains. The function virStorageVolLookupByPath finds the storage volume object based on its path on the node.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStoragePoolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents a storage pool, which is a logical area used to allocate and store storage volumes. The function virConnectListAllStoragePools lists all of the virtualization storage pools on the hypervisor. The function virStoragePoolLookupByVolume finds the storage pool containing a given storage volume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These names follow C conventions, but developers of cloud computing platforms and applications do not need to use C directly, there are language bindings available for major languages. Currently libvirt API language bindings <a href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a> are available for C#, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-management-architecture">
<h3>Domain Management Architecture</h3>
<p>There are two distinct means for domain management using libvirt API.</p>
<p><strong>1. Single node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_single_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As illustrated in the figure above in this mode applications (cloud management platform i.e. CMP applications) and domains exist on the same node. In this scenario applications directly works through the libvirt api on the host operating system (os) to control and manage the local domains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_multi_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, applications (CMP applications) using libvirt API and the domains to manage or control are on separate nodes. In this mode a special domain called <strong>libvirtd</strong> (libvirt daemon) needs to run on remote nodes. The management application nodes use the nodes underlying network communicattion to communicate with remote <em>libvirtd</em> through the local libvirt using custom protocol. Actually libvirt uses Remote <a href="#f6" id="id5">[6]</a> driver for communicating with remote node and remote API calls are handled synchronously. Remote driver for libvirt supports a range of transports like:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>tls</em></dt>
<dd>TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) authenticated and encrypted TCP/IP socket, usually listening on a public port number. To use this you will need to generate client and server certificates. The standard port is 16514. This is the <strong>default</strong> transport, if no other is specified.</dd>
<dt><em>unix</em></dt>
<dd>nix domain socket. Since this is only accessible on the local machine, it is not encrypted, and uses Unix permissions or SELinux for authentication. The standard socket names are /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro (the latter for read-only connections).</dd>
<dt><em>ssh</em></dt>
<dd>Transported over an ordinary ssh (secure shell) connection. Requires Netcat (nc) installed and libvirtd should be running on the remote machine. You should use some sort of ssh key management (eg. ssh-agent) otherwise programs which use this transport will stop to ask for a password.</dd>
<dt><em>ext</em></dt>
<dd>Any external program which can make a connection to the remote machine by means outside the scope of libvirt.</dd>
<dt><em>tcp</em></dt>
<dd>nencrypted TCP/IP socket. Not recommended for production use, this is normally disabled, but an administrator can enable it for testing or use over a trusted network. The standard port is 16509.</dd>
<dt><em>libssh2</em></dt>
<dd>Transport over the SSH protocol using libssh2 instead of the OpenSSH binary. This transport uses the libvirt authentication callback for all ssh authentication calls and therefore supports keyboard-interactive authentication even with graphical management applications. As with the classic ssh transport netcat is required on the remote side.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Libvirt is one very important library on whose giant shoulders cloud computing services and platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus and numberous others are standing. Also this API enables developers and companies to build new and innovative cloud computing services or platforms and build awesome applications or services on top of it. Libvirt started in 2005 and with growing popularity of cloud computing, this project will continue to grow. But in most of the conferences, talks and papers related to Cloud Computing I did not find much coverage of libvirt, so while researching Cloud Management platform thought of writing and article on it. Kudos to all the libvirt code contributors for building a beautiful abstraction layer and making life easier for cloud computing services and platform developers. In spite of not getting as much press and coverage as …</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<p> In 2020, we are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0358">publication</a>  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> in <em>Neural Computation</em> (2010) on deep multilayer perceptrons trained by plain gradient descent on GPU. Surprisingly, our simple but unusually deep supervised artificial neural network (NN) outperformed all previous methods on the (back then famous) machine learning benchmark MNIST. That is, by 2010, when compute was 100 times more expensive than today, both our <em>feedforward</em> NNs <em>and</em> our earlier <em>recurrent</em> NNs (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">CTC-LSTM for connected handwriting recognition</a>) were  able to beat all competing algorithms on important problems of that time. In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this deep learning revolution 
quickly spread from Europe to America and Asia. 
</p><hr>


<p>  
Just one decade ago, many thought that deep NNs  
cannot learn much without  unsupervised pre-training,
a technique 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">introduced by myself in 1991</a> <a href="#UN0">[UN0-UN3]</a> and later also championed by others, e.g., <a href="#UN4">[UN4-5]</a> <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a> <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>. In fact, it was
 claimed <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a>
that <em>"nobody in their right mind would ever suggest"</em>  
to use plain gradient descent through <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">backpropagation</a> <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a>
(see also <a href="#BPA">[BPA-C]</a> 
 <a href="#BP2">[BP2-6]</a> <a href="#R7">[R7]</a>)
 to train feedforward NNs (FNNs) with many layers of neurons.


</p><p> However, in March 2010, our team with  my outstanding Romanian 
postdoc Dan Ciresan  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> 
showed that deep FNNs  
can indeed be trained by plain backpropagation 
 for important applications.  
This neither required <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html">unsupervised pre-training</a>  
nor Ivakhnenko's incremental  layer-wise training of 1965 <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a>. 
By the standards of 2010, our supervised NN had many layers.
It  set a new performance record <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> on 
the back then famous and widely used image recognition benchmark called MNIST <a href="#MNI">[MNI]</a>.
This was achieved by greatly accelerating traditional 
multilayer perceptrons on highly parallel 
graphics processing units called GPUs, going beyond the important GPU
work of Jung &amp; Oh (2004) <a href="#GPUNN">[GPUNN]</a>. 
A reviewer called this a 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">"wake-up call to the machine learning community."</a>

</p><p> Our results set the stage for the recent <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">decade of deep learning</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>. In February 2011, our team extended the approach to deep Convolutional NNs (CNNs) <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>. This 
greatly improved earlier work
 <a href="#GPUCNN">[GPUCNN]</a>.  
The so-called <em>DanNet</em>
<a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a> <a href="#R6">[R6]</a> broke several benchmark records.
In May 2011, <em>DanNet</em> was
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">the first deep CNN to win a computer vision competition</a> <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN3">[GPUCNN3]</a>. 
In August 2011, it was 
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">the first to win a vision contest with superhuman performance</a>
 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Our team kept winning vision contests in 2012 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Subsequently, many researchers adopted this technique.
By May 2015, we had the first extremely deep 
FNNs with more than 100 layers <a href="#HW1">[HW1]</a> (compare <a href="#HW2">[HW2]</a> <a href="#HW3">[HW3]</a>). 

</p><p> The original successes required a precise understanding of 
the inner workings of GPUs  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>.
Today, convenient software packages shield the user from such details. 
Compute is roughly 100 times cheaper than a decade ago, 
and many commercial NN applications are based on what started in 2010 <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.



 

</p><p>In this context it should be mentioned that right before the 2010s, our team had already achieved another breakthrough in supervised 
deep learning with the 
more powerful <em>recurrent</em> NNs (RNNs) whose basic architectures were introduced over
half a century earlier
<a href="#MC43">[MC43]</a> <a href="#K56">[K56]</a>.  
My PhD student Alex Graves won <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">three connected handwriting competitions (French, Farsi, Arabic)</a> at ICDAR 2009, the famous conference on document analysis and recognition. He used a combination of two methods developed in my research 
groups at TU Munich and the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA: Supervised LSTM RNNs (1990s-2005) <a href="#LSTM0">[LSTM0-6]</a>
(which overcome the famous 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fundamentaldeeplearningproblem.html">vanishing gradient problem</a>
 analyzed by my PhD student Sepp Hochreiter <a href="#VAN1">[VAN1]</a> in 1991) and <em>Connectionist Temporal Classification</em> <a href="#CTC">[CTC]</a> (2006).
CTC-trained LSTM was the first  RNN 
to win international contests.
Compare <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">Sec. 4</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> and <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#A">Sec. A</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#B">B</a> of <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>.

</p><p> That is,  by 2010, both our supervised FNNs and our supervised RNNs  
were able to outperform 
all other methods on important problems. 
In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this supervised  deep learning revolution quickly spread from Europe to North America and Asia,
with <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">enormous impact on industry and daily life</a>  <a href="#DL4">[DL4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.
However, it should be mentioned that
the conceptual roots of deep learning 
reach back deep into the previous millennium <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-2]</a> 
  <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2021">Sec. 21</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">Sec. 19</a>) <a href="#T20">[T20]</a> (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#II">Sec.

The opinions expressed in it are those of its author.)</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="695" data-original-width="695" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>

  <p>01 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>One of the eternal laws of the internet dictates that as soon as one person says
they have a new thing that lets them type faster — a keyboard, a keyboard
layout, an editor configuration, etc. —&nbsp;somebody else must say: “but typing is
not the bottleneck!”</p>

<p>What the second person means is that the first person is wasting their time.
They’re optimizing something that’s not slowing them down. Typing is not the
bottleneck, because <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9715810">“typing is perhaps 0.5-1% of my programming
time”</a>. Programming is <em>thinking</em>, talking to people, planning,
researching, is what incarnations of person #2 are saying. And if you think your
keyboard is holding you back from thinking, well, you’re wrong.</p>

<p>I get that. I don’t write code the whole day either.</p>

<p>But here’s what I need to write and type besides code: commit messages, pull
request descriptions, emails, tickets, comments on tickets, code reviews,
documentation, Slack messages, notes, journal entries, RFCs, design documents,
requirements.</p>

<p>And being able to type fast and without much effort sure as hell helps. It lets
me get back to the thinking.</p>

<p>Effort, that’s the important one, not raw speed. It doesn’t matter if you can
type 90 words per minutes or 130, but if it takes you <em>effort</em> to type something
and, if given the choice, you’d rather not do it, then we have a problem.</p>

<p>Take me on my phone, for example. It takes me a lot of effort to type on it.
It’s not only that I’m slow because I can’t use more than two fingers, but every
third word is a typo. Or, even more infuriating, it’s the wrong word and I need
to correct autocorrect. Or I switched from English to German while typing and my
phone doesn’t know what an umlaut is anymore.</p>

<p>If you see me typing on my phone chances are you can also hear me producing an
angry growl-like sound.</p>

<p>Which is exactly why I don’t do it a lot. I barely use the note taking apps I
have, because I’d rather type on my computer, with a proper keyboard. I often
refrain from replying to messages if I don’t have to, because, yep, I’d have to
type those replies.</p>

<p>In other words: typing <em>is</em> a bottleneck for me.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me on my phone. Ever had a chat conversation with somebody who
wasn’t comfortable typing? Here’s what you get: short messages, acronyms, typos,
missing sentences. You can <em>read</em> how they struggled to type. I once had a
colleague who had the habit of walking to my desk saying “Ah, before I type all
that up, I thought I’d quickly tell you in person” where “all that” was three to
four paragraphs, at the most.</p>

<p>And that’s what this is about. If you’re not comfortable typing a lot and you’d
rather not write something down then typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck and you need to
fix it. Typing is not something you should need to think about.</p>

<p>Because wouldn’t it be a waste of time if you spend 99% of your time lying in a
hammock, thinking, but then choose not to write all of your ideas down, because
typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck?</p>

<article>
  <p>This blog post discusses the support for Rightward assignments in ruby.</p>

<h3 id="before">Before</h3>

<p>Historically, all of the early programming languages were designed by Mathematicians. It’s a common practice in mathematics to say <code>let x = 4y + z</code>, which is read as let <code>x</code> be equal to <code>4y + z</code>.</p>

<p>So the same pattern is followed in programming languages as well.</p>

<p>For assigning a value to a variable, we typically do <code>age = 42</code> in ruby. Here we are assigning the <code>Rvalue</code> <code>42</code> to an <code>Lvalue</code> <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>While the above pattern has become standardized, it feels somewhat unnatural as we read most of the spoken languages from left to right.</p>

<p>We were not able to do something like <code>42 =&gt; age</code>.</p>

<h3 id="after">After</h3>

<p>With the recent <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/1b2d351b216661e03d497dfdce216e0d51474664#diff-8312ad0561ef661716b48d09478362f3">changes</a>, Ruby supports the <strong>Right ward assignments</strong> as demonstrated below.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>box_height</span> <span># This is equivalent to box_height = 3</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a look at few more examples:</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>traits</span>
  <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>traits</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>



<h3 id="additional-notes">Additional notes:</h3>

<p>There are already some languages which support rightward assignment.</p>

<p><code>TI-BASIC’s</code> uses STO (“store”) operation to achieve this, as demonstrated below:</p>

<p><code>42→age</code></p>

<p><code>R language</code> also has a similar way of doing this  <code>42 -&gt; age</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is added as an experimental feature in Ruby, which means it could be removed depending on the feedback received.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is the article I wish I had read when I started coding. Programming is about solving problems and here I will dive deep into 20 problem-solving techniques, with code samples, big O analysis, and challenges so that you can master them.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourdevopsguy.com/how-to-ace-coding-interviews-the-ultimate-guide-ckcxekdxp00bqois16r59a9c1">this article</a>, I outlined a high-level strategy to prepare for your next coding interview as well as the top mistakes to avoid. Here, I will dive deep into 20 problem-solving techniques that you must know to excel at your next interview. They have helped me at work too and even given me ideas for a side project I am working on. Also, the last section includes a <strong>step-by-step guide to learn (not memorize) any algorithm or data structure</strong>, with 2 examples.</p>
<p>I have grouped these techniques in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pointer based</li>
<li>Recursion based</li>
<li>Sorting and searching</li>
<li>Extending basic data structures</li>
<li>Miscellanea</li>
</ul>
<p>I will explain each of them, show how to apply them to coding problems, and leave you some exercises so that you can practice on your own.</p>
<p>This list is part of the study notes that I took before I applied to Amazon. I hope they will be as useful to you as they have been to me.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I have copied here the problem statements, but I have left links to all of the exercises. You can copy-paste my solution and play around with it. I strongly recommend you code your solution and see if it passes the tests.</p>
<p>Some of the questions are better explained through an image or diagram. For these, I have left a comment asking you to open the link to get a graphical description of the problem.</p>

<h2 id="1-two-pointers">1. Two Pointers</h2>
<p>This technique is very useful on <em>sorted arrays</em> and arrays whose elements we want to <em>group</em>. </p>
<p>The idea is to use two (or more pointers) to split the array into different areas or groups based on some condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements smaller than, equal to and greater than a certain value</li>
<li>Elements whose sum is too small or too large</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples will help you understand this principle.</p>
<h3 id="two-sumhttpsleetcodecomproblemstwo-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/">Two sum</a></h3>
<p>Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.</li>
<li>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9</li>
<li>Output: [1,2]</li>
<li>Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Since the array <em>a</em> is sorted, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest sum is equal to the sum of the last 2 elements</li>
<li>The smallest sum is equal to the sum of the first 2 elements </li>
<li>For any index <em>i</em> in [0, a.size() - 1) =&gt; a[i + 1] &gt;= a[i]</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we can design the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep 2 pointers: <em>l</em>, starting at the first element of the array, and <em>r</em> starting at to the last.</li>
<li>If the sum of a[l] + a[r] is smaller than our target, we increment l by one (to change the smallest operand in the addition for another one equal or larger than it at <em>l+1</em>); if it is larger than the target, we decrease r by one (to change our largest operand for another one equal or smaller at <em>r-1</em>).</li>
<li>We do this until a[l] + a[r] equals our target or l and r point to the same element (since we cannot use the same element twice) or have crossed, indicating there is no solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple C++ implementation:</p>
<pre><code><span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; twoSum(<span>const</span> <span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; a, <span>int</span> target) {
        <span>int</span> l = <span>0</span>, r = a.size() - <span>1</span>;
        <span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; sol;
        <span>while</span>(l &lt; r) {
            <span>const</span> <span>int</span> sum = a[l] + a[r];
            <span>if</span>(target == sum){
                sol.push_back(l + <span>1</span>); 
                sol.push_back(r + <span>1</span>); 
                <span>break</span>;
            } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (target &gt; sum) {
                ++l;
            } <span>else</span> {
                --r;
            }
        }
        <span>return</span> sol;
    }
</code></pre><p>The time complexity is O(N), since we may need to traverse the N elements of the array to find the solution. </p>
<p>The space complexity is O(1), since we only need two pointers, regardless of how many elements the array contains.</p>
<p>There are other ways of solving this problem (using a hash table, for example), but I have used it just as an illustration of the two pointer technique.</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>Here are two variations of this exercise: <a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/">three sum</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/">four sum</a>. They can be solved similarly by <strong>reducing</strong> them to this very same problem. </p>
<p>This is a very common technique: <strong>transform a problem whose solution you don't know to a problem that you can solve</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="remove-duplicates-from-arrayhttpsleetcodecomproblemsremove-duplicates-from-sorted-array"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/">Remove duplicates from array</a></h3>
<p>Given a sorted array, nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given nums = [1,1,2],</li>
<li>Output = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],</li>
<li>Output = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The array is <strong>sorted</strong> and we want to move duplicates to the end of the array, which sounds a lot like <strong>grouping based on some condition</strong>. How would you solve this problem using two pointers?</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need one pointer to iterate through the array, <em>i</em>.</li>
<li>And a second pointer, <em>n</em>, one to define the area that contains no duplicates: [0,n].</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic is as follows. If the values of the elements at index <em>i</em> (except <em>i</em> = 0) and <em>i-1</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same, we don’t do anything - this duplicate will be overwritten by the next unique element in <em>a</em>.</li>
<li>Different: we add <em>a[i]</em> to the section of the array that contains no duplicates - delimited by <em>n</em>, and increment n by one.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>removeDuplicates</span><span>(<span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; nums)</span> </span>{
    <span>if</span>(nums.empty())
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    <span>int</span> n = <span>0</span>;
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; nums.size(); ++i){
        <span>if</span>(i == <span>0</span> || nums[i] != nums[i - <span>1</span>]){
            nums[n++] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    <span>return</span> n;
    }
</code></pre><p>This problem has linear time complexity and constant space complexity (it is usually the case for problems solved using this technique).</p>
<h3 id="sort-colorshttpsleetcodecomproblemssort-colors"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/">Sort colors</a></h3>
<p>Given an array with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
Note: You are not supposed to use the library's sort function for this problem.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]</li>
<li>Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The groups this time are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller than 1</li>
<li>Equal to 1</li>
<li>Larger than 1</li>
</ul>
<p>What we can achieve with 3 pointers. </p>
<p>This implementation is a bit tricky, so make sure you test it thoroughly.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>sortColors</span><span>(<span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; nums)</span> </span>{
    <span>int</span> smaller = <span>0</span>, eq = <span>0</span>, larger = nums.size() - <span>1</span>;
    <span>while</span>(eq &lt;= larger){
        <span>if</span>(nums[eq] == <span>0</span>){
            swap(nums[smaller], nums[eq]);
            ++smaller; ++eq;
        } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (nums[eq] == <span>2</span>) {
            swap(nums[larger], nums[eq]);
            --larger;
        } <span>else</span> {
            eq++;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Since need to traverse the array to sort it, the time complexity is O(N). The space complexity is O(1).</p>
<p>Just as a curiosity, this is an instance of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem">National Dutch flag</a> problem described by Dijkstra.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-n-th-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-listhttpswwwgeeksforgeeksorgnth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/">Remove the n-th node from the end of a linked list</a></h3>
<p>Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n-th node from the end of the Linked List.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>This is one of the most common variations of the two-pointer technique: introducing <strong>an offset</strong> so that one of the pointers reaches a certain condition, the other one is in the position you are interested in.</p>
<p>In this case, if we move one of the pointers, <em>f</em>, n times and then start advancing both at the same time by one node, when <em>f</em> reaches the end of the list the other pointer, <em>s</em>, will point to the node right before the node we want to delete.</p>
<p>Make sure you define what n = 1 means (last element or the element before the last element?), and avoid off-by-one errors.</p>
<p>The time and space complexity are the same as the previous problems'.</p>
<h2 id="2-pointers-moving-at-different-speeds">2. Pointers moving at different speeds</h2>
<p>Now, you will have two pointers moving at different <em>speeds</em>: at every iteration, one of the pointers will advance one node and the other will advance two nodes. We can use this variation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get to the middle element of a linked list</li>
<li>Detect cycles in a linked list</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, it will become clearer once I present some examples.</p>
<h3 id="find-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list-of-unknown-sizehttpsleetcodecomproblemsmiddle-of-the-linked-list"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/">Find the middle node of a linked list of unknown size</a></h3>
<p>Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of the list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: [1,2,3,4,5]</li>
<li>Output: Node 3 from this list</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Solving this problem in 2 passes is easy: on the first pass we compute the size of the list, <em>L</em>, and on the second pass we only advance <em>L/2</em> nodes to find the element at the middle of the list. This approach has linear complexity in time and constant in space.</p>
<p>How can we use 2 pointers to find the middle element in one single pass?</p>
<p>If one of the pointers, <em>f</em>, moves twice as fast as the other one <em>s</em>, when <em>f</em> reaches the end, <em>s</em> will be in the middle of the list.</p>
<p>Here's my solution in C++. Make sure you take into account edge cases (empty list, lists of odd and even sizes, etc) when you test your code.</p>
<pre><code>ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
       ListNode* slow = head;
       ListNode* fast = head;

       <span>while</span> (fast != nullptr &amp;&amp; fast-&gt;<span>next</span> != nullptr) {
           slow = slow-&gt;<span>next</span>;
           fast = fast-&gt;<span>next</span>-&gt;<span>next</span>;
       }
       <span>return</span> slow; 
    }
</code></pre><h2 id="detect-cycle-in-a-linked-listhttpsleetcodecomproblemslinked-list-cycle"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/">Detect cycle in a linked list</a></h2>
<p>Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1</li>
<li>Output: true</li>
<li>Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the second node.</li>

      <div>
        
        <p>UEFI provides a number of features including Secure Boot that minimizes risk of rootkits and creates a chain of trust from the firmware all the way to the loading of third-party kernel modules.</p>
<p>UEFI and Secure Boot are enabled by default in new Windows 10 installations.  In my case, however, I upgraded from Windows 7 so my instance of Windows 10 uses a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition scheme and Legacy BIOS firmware.</p>
<p>I’m running my copy of Windows 10 in a virtual machine using VMWare Fusion on macOS, so I started by creating a snapshot.  We’ll first need to convert the partition table from MBR to GPT, then change the VM settings to use UEFI firmware and Secure Boot.</p>
<p>A Windows 10 installation partitions a disk similar to the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">--------------------------------------------------------------
| System   | C:\                                 | Recovery  |
| Reserved |                                     | Partition |
| 100 MB   |                                     |           |
--------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre></div><p>Since I’m running Windows 10 in a virtual machine, at some point I needed to increase my hard disk size. In order to extend the C:\ partition to make use of the additional hard disk space I deleted the recovery partition.  If you still have your recovery partition this process becomes a lot smoother for you.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, you would restart the system in recovery mode and execute these commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">&gt;mbr2gpt /validate
&gt;mbr2gpt /convert
</code></pre></div><p>If you’re like me and you don’t have a recovery partition, you will have to do the online conversion:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">&gt;mbr2gpt /validate /allowfullos
&gt;mbr2gpt /convert /allowfullos
</code></pre></div><p>But running <code>mbr2gpt /validate /allowfullos</code> will fail with error <code>Cannot find OS partition(s) for disk 0</code> if you have deleted the recovery partition.  This error occurs because mbr2gpt reads from the Boot Configuration Data Store (BCD) and the Windows Boot Loader’s recovery sequence was pointing to the Windows Recovery Environment that was previously deleted.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">&gt;reagentc /info

<p>The modern world more or less gives you the philosophical choice of either <dfn>hedonism</dfn> or <dfn>asceticism</dfn>.
You never really hear it in those terms, but that's how it is.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hedonism living for pleasure.</strong>

Your default lifestyle is eating whatever, watching Netflix and playing video games irrespective of how late it is.
You watch porn, masturbate, have sex as much as you can and any consequences of any of this are just facts of life which you view as either out of your control or worth the suffering.
You might not use drugs because you are worried of the hedonistic damage it can cause, but you're at least <q>chill</q> with people who do.
At a basic level, modern society is hedonistic because it more or less openly holds as highest moral value what can stimulate people the most.
You know this is the case because anyone who <em>condemns</em> hedonistic behavior will immediately be judged as <q>judgemental.</q>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Asceticism is supposed to be the <q>smart</q> alternative.</strong>
Asceticism is rejecting pleasure, normal life and anything else enjoyable in the world as morally inferior to some higher non-physical ideal.
Buddhism, which rejects the physical world, has become a popular meme philosophy in the West and is highly acetic.
Vegans are acetic: they abandon basic life for their own principles and intense vegans will eventually start talking about "transcending" and "vibrations" and non-sense.
Asceticism come in many forms nowadays, but it is always a reaction to the indulgences of hedonism.
</p>

<h2>The Poetic Worldview</h2>

<a href="https://renaissanceastrology.com/hermestrismegistus.html">
<figure>
<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/gifs/hermes.png" alt="Hermes">
<figcaption>Hermes Trismegistus,<br>author of the Hermetic Corpus</figcaption>
</figure>
</a>

<p>
The Poetic Worldview is the solution.
Don't worry, it has nothing to do with poetry.
</p>

<p>
The Greek word that <em>poetry/poetic</em> comes from actually is just a generate word for <em>make, create, produce</em>.
The word "poetry" originally just meant something like "creative output."
</p>

<p>
This view is tied into early Platonism and monotheism.
The physical universe is a creation or manifestation or "the One" or "the Source" or really <dfn>God</dfn>.
God is the ultimate creator, and an individual is <strong>good</strong> insofar as <dfn>he reflects this creative tendency of God</dfn>.
We see it expounded in the Hermetic Corpus:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <q>The other name of God is Father, again because He is the
that-which-maketh-all.
The part of father is to make.</q>
    <cite><a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th205.html">To Asclepius</a> (17), from the <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm">Hermetic Corpus</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Poetic Worldview, <strong>the highest moral goal is creation</strong>.
That can be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>affecting the world,</li>
    <li>improving what is around you,</li>
    <li>having children,</li>
    <li>making money not to spend it on pleasures, but to make something new and great with it,</li>
    <li>writing or making something useful or edifying for others,</li>
    <li>clearing up misconceptions that get in other people's way in accomplishing these things.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Poetic worldview, hedonism is evil because it is expending otherwise creative energy into nothing of consequence.
Racking up video-game achievements that no one will ever know or care of but you,
watching pornography, pursuing fleeting relationships,
impulsively wasting time browsing the internet and fiddling with social media.
</p>

<p>This passive and impulsive pleasure-seeking reduces someone's ability to live as intended, instead, they are prisoners to their lusts and conveniences:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <q>But whatsoever human souls have not the Mind as pilot, they share in the same fate as souls of lives irrational.
For [Mind] becomes co-worker with them, giving full play to the desires towards which [such souls] are borne,—[desires] that from the rush of lust strain after the irrational; [so that such human souls,] just like irrational animals, cease not irrationally to rage and lust, nor ever are they satiate of ills.
For passions and irrational desires are ills exceeding great; and over these God hath set up the Mind to play the part of judge and executioner.</q>
    <cite><a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th225.html">About the Common Mind</a> (4), from the <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm">Hermetic Corpus</a></cite>
</blockquote>


<p>
Hedonism is additionally harmful because <em>it isn't even hedonistic</em>.
It's clumsy and self-destructive.
Spend your life from ages 16-23 playing videogames, masturbating and smoking weed and you have destroyed your capacity to enjoy life, sex and have normal interactions with normal people.
Your capacity for enjoyment ends and you fall into asceticism as a cope.
</p>

<p><strong>Asceticism is just as evil</strong> because it seeing this issue with the hedonistic lifestyle and tosses up its hands in surrender.
It internalizes the lie that wasteful and sinful living is somehow obviously funner—when they see they aren't actually having fun, they throw the whole world away.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Most ascetics are liars anyway.</strong>
They pretend to reject pleasure and worldly things, but they often just seek it in perverted or unconventional ways.
There are men who call themselves MGTOW (Men going their own way) who "swear off" women.
In reality, most of them are just desperate porn-addicted men who just can't get the girl they want.
</p>

<p>Contrary to all of this, having a Poetic view proposes that the more moral and also most enjoyable life is one where one is constantly creating something new out of what he is given.
In Hermetic thinking (and, well, Christian thinking) man must hold God as the idea to emulate.
Since God's principle feat is creation from nothing, our goal is to celebrate that creation by making something new and productive from the raw materials we have.
</p>

<p>Asceticism views the material world <em>as a mistake or illusion</em> which leads people to reject life itself.
The Poetic view is that the physical world is a <strong>reflection its spiritual state</strong>, and what you do in the physical world reflects your spiritual stature.
</p>

<p>The Poetic view is <em>somewhat</em> similar to Nietzsche's <dfn>Will to Power</dfn>,
which was an attempt to unite both human and material sciences under the idea that the ideal is maximizing one's
output on the external world.
Will to Power is a little more morally ambivalent though; it can include destruction, while Poeticism merely values creative power.
</p>

<h2>Distractions are literally evil.</h2>

<p>This is why <dfn>I highly condemn wasteful activities like videogames and pornography and social media</dfn>.
They are principally habits that divert your natural energies into something absolutely sterile.
<strong>Many people ask me <q>What can I do to be more productive?</q></strong> and I have to say that the most important thing is to <strong>remove inert distractions and habits</strong>.
</p>

<p>Due to bureaucratic workplaces and bureaucratic education, there are many modern people who <em>just don't know what it means to be productive</em>.
Most of their lives might be someone trying to fill their day with busywork.
Since the normal enjoyable ritual of creative output is unknown to them, this causes a kind of aimlessness and the <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/files/unabomber.pdf">feelings of inferiority</a> that comes with that.
</p>

<p>
But in truth, you live at <strong>an ideal period</strong> in that you can have a highly impactful and ergo <em>poetic</em> effect on the world using internet technology and the higher material standard of living.
The only trick is to sidestep the distractions of hedonism that turns you into a passive consumer and the apathy of asceticism.
</p>

<p>
 On June 26th 2017, Daniel was denied to travel to the US - while still having
 a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. When
 subsequently applying for a visa instead, there has been no response for over
 two years. (To <i>visit</i>, not to apply for permanent residency.)

</p><p> FAQ </p>
<p>
<a href="#long">Do you know why this takes so long?</a>
</p><div>
<p> No. They've just informed me "someone is working on it" and that it "may take a long time" but without qualifying what that means.
</p><p> I've talked to several persons who've experienced similar situations, and
  I've learned about waiting times up to 20 months until a definite "no". I used
  to think of that as a sort of "worst case" waiting time. Now we know it can
  take longer...
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#esta">Why don't you just apply for an ESTA?</a>
</p><p>
  I already did and they denied me that. See one of the <a href="#images">images below</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why did they deny you ESTA?
</p><p>
  I don't know as they won't tell. And I also don't know why they can't respond to my visa application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#working">So, someone is working on it?</a>
</p><p>
  Allegedly, yes. I'm sure that person must be working very hard...
</p>
<p>
<a href="#eventually">Do you think they will grant you a visa eventually?</a>
</p><div>
<p>
  No. I've been in contact with many people who have been in similar
  situations such as this, as well as many people who have applied for visas
  for very complicated matters, and it is basically unheard of that it would
  take this long time and still end up with a positive response in the end.
</p><p>
  Someone emailed me and explained how they got their visa approved after 10
  months waiting - so it obviously <i>can</i> happen after a fairly
  long time!
</p></div>
<p>
<a name="#arab">Did you travel to any arab countries, middle-east, North Korea, Sudan, Iran or Iraq?</a>
</p><p>
 No.
</p>
<p>
<a name="#ever">Did you ever visit the US?</a>
</p><div>
<p> Yes, I've visted the US around a dozen times over a time period of almost
 twenty years. I've applied and gotten ESTA permissions several times. I have
 many friends living and working in the US.
</p><p> My latest visit to the US was in December 2016 - using the same ESTA and
 passport I subsequently wanted to use in the summer of 2017 when I was first
 denied travelling to the US.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#blocked">How many trips have this blocked you from taking so far?</a>

 attend. (excluding IETF, HTTPbis or QUIC meetings)

</p><p> We've already tried all available ways to get information or otherwise
bring this effort forward. To no avail.

<p>
<a href="#Mozilla">Will Mozilla move more meetings outside of the US?</a>
</p><p> Yes. Several of the coming All hands are now planned and scheduled to
happen outside of the US, for example in Canada and Germany. But I will not be
there to experience them since I quit Mozilla in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
Will your visa situation change when you've quit Mozilla?
</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no reason to suspect or hope so.

<a href="#lost">Maybe they lost your application?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I emailed them in July 2019 just to make sure they just hadn't
 forgot about my case or similar over the past year, and I received their
 reply on August 1st 2019. The response said "I have forwarded your email to
 my supervisor to highlight the problem."  - but then nothing more came.
</p><p> I emailed them again on January 28, 2020.<br>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png">
</p><p>
 They responded very politely:
 </p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner
possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow
immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or
circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the
administrative processing is concluded.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#likely">What do you think is the most likely explanation for this treatment?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I think one of the likelier explantions is that someone somewhere has
 found my name and my code used in some evil or malicious manner and drawn the
 wrong conclusions about how my code ended up there or how I could've been
 involved. Like for example in some malware, virus or other attack software. I
 make tools and code available for free and openly and sometimes those are
 unfortunately used in ways I don't condone.
</p><p> Since they won't tell me why, basically all theories are equally likely.
 We just won't know.
</p></div>
<p>
Any other plausible explanations?
</p><div>
<p> People have mentioned my domain name <b>haxx.se</b> or suggested it is
because I've referred to myself as "a hacker" at times. I find that unlikely
since I used the domain and used the term for decades before this.
</p><p> Others have offered the explanation that the immigration authorities
might've decided that I violated the ESTA rules in a previous visit. I can of
course not know what they think, but I have not violated those rules.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#crime">Convicted of a crime?</a>
</p><p>
No, I've never been convicted of a crime in Sweden and not anywhere else. Not even
charged. Nor have I ever been involved in a lawsuit of any kind.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#license">Can you change the curl license?</a>
</p><div><p>
Lots of people suggest this, most probably in jest, but let me be perfectly
clear: no I won't change the curl license.
</p><ol>
 <li> excluding a specific user would make a license to not be open source anymore
 </li><li> curl has many more copyrights than mine, it would be hard
 </li><li> curl is bigger than me personally, I wouldn't do it anyway
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#covid">But Covid-19?</a>
</p><p>
During the Corona pandemic (starting in spring 2020), the US has closed its
borders for a lot of more people who otherwise would have been allowed
entry. I suspect the visa processing has slowed down during this period since
people can't go there anyway. But I have not been notified about anything and
I still expect to get a rejection at some point. Pandemic or not.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#officials">Have you contacted any US officials?</a>
</p><div><p>
A US citizen friend of mine sent the following text in an email to the
U.S. Congressman Gerry Connolly on September 3, 2020.
</p><pre>Dear Representative Gerry Connolly:
&nbsp;
Could you please help my friend Daniel Stenberg *finally* gain permission to
travel to the US? He has been denied permission to travel to the US for years,
yet there is no cause for it.
&nbsp;
On June 26, 2017, Mr. Stenberg was denied to travel to the US, even though he
had a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. He
then applied for a visa in April 2018, and has *still* not heard anything.
&nbsp;
This is especially galling because is a widely-known leader in the computer
community. He developed and maintains the "curl" program, a program used
worldwide by many software developers and computer system administrators. In
October 2017 he won the "Polhem prize" for his work on curl; in that ceremony
the Swedish king personally handed Daniel a gold medal. In February 2019 he
joined wolfSSL, an American company (he's their only Swedish hire), and yet
he's still not allowed to travel to the US.
&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a confusion about the word "hacker". In the computer
community, a "hacker" is NOT someone who breaks into computers, a hacker
is "a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
particular."  ( IETF RFC 1983, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983).

Mr. Stenberg does *not* break into computers without authorization.
&nbsp;
At the least, the State Department should have asked questions instead of
reflexively denying entry to a world leader in the computer industry.
&nbsp;
More information is available on his personal website:

&nbsp;
Thank you very much!

September 3, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

 <p><span> Jan 22, 2020</span></p>
<p><img data-src=" /assets/pages/design_patterns_book/bookcover_200px.jpg" alt=" Book cover" src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/design_patterns_book/bookcover_200px.jpg"> This blog post contains an excerpt from my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Design-Patterns-Julia-comprehensive-ebook/dp/B07SHV9PVV">Hands-on Design Patterns and Best Practices with Julia</a>, published by Packt Publishing in January 2020.  This is my first book, and I have spent months of my weekend time to do the research and write about various patterns pioneered by other expert Julia programmers.  I also feel honored to have Stefan Karpinski write forewords for the book.</p>
<p>If you like the content below, you can support me by buying the book (ISBN: 183864881X), telling your buddies about the book, or even just sending me a note via the official JuliaLang Slack. In addition, any constructive criticism are pleasantly welcomed.  <em>After all, life is a continuous learning process.</em></p>
<p>The Holy Traits pattern is one that I found most interesting with the Julia language as it fully leverages the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY&amp;t=2m18s">multiple dispatch</a> feature.  <strong><em>Happy reading!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The holy traits pattern has an interesting name. Some people also call it the <strong>Tim Holy Traits Trick (THTT)</strong>. The pattern is named after <a href="https://github.com/timholy">Tim Holy</a>, who is a long-time contributor to the Julia language and ecosystem.</p>
<p>What are <strong>traits</strong>? In a nutshell, a trait corresponds to the behavior of an object. For example, birds and butterflies can fly, so they both have the <em>CanFly</em> trait. Dolphins and turtles can swim, so they both have the <em>CanSwim</em> trait. A duck can fly and swim, so it has both the <em>CanFly</em> and <em>CanSwim</em> traits. Traits are typically binary – you either exhibit the trait or not – although that is not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Why do we want traits? Traits can be used as a formal contract about how a data type can be used. For example, if an object has the <em>CanFly</em> trait, then we would be quite confident that the object has some kind of <code>fly</code> method defined. Likewise, if an object has the <em>CanSwim</em> trait, then we can probably call some kind of <code>swim</code> function.</p>
<p>Let's get back to programming. The Julia language doesn't have any built-in support for traits. However, the language is versatile enough for developers to use traits with the help of the multiple dispatch system. In this section, we will look into how this can be done with the special technique known as <strong>holy traits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="exploring_the_personal_asset_management_use_case"><a href="#exploring_the_personal_asset_management_use_case">Exploring the personal asset management use case</a></h2>
<p>When designing reusable software, we often create abstractions as data types and associate behaviors with them. One way to model behaviors is to leverage a type hierarchy. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>, we should be able to substitute a type with a subtype when a function is called.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the type hierarchy for managing personal assets.</p>
<p><img data-src=" /assets/pages/design_patterns_book/abstract_type_hier4.png" alt=" Personal Asset Type Hierarchy" src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/design_patterns_book/abstract_type_hier4.png"></p><p>We can define a function called <code>value</code> for determining the value of any asset. Such a function can be applied to all the types in the <code>Asset</code> hierarchy if we assume that all the asset types have some kind of monetary value attached to them. Following that line of thought, we can say that almost every asset exhibits the <em>HasValue</em> trait.</p>
<p>Sometimes, behaviors can only be applied to certain types in the hierarchy. For example, what if we want to define a <code>trade</code> function that only works with liquid investments? In that case, we would define trade functions for <code>Investment</code> and <code>Cash</code> but not for <code>House</code> and <code>Apartments</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A liquid investment refers to a security instrument that can be traded easily in the open market. The investor can quickly convert a liquid instrument into cash and vice versa. In general, most investors would like a portion of their investment to be liquid in the case of an emergency. Investments that are not liquid are called illiquid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programmatically, how do we know which asset types are liquid? One way is to check the type of the object against a list of types that represent liquid investments. Suppose that we have an array of assets and need to find out which one can be traded quickly for cash. In this situation, the code may look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>function show_tradable_assets(assets::Vector{Asset})
    for asset in assets
        if asset isa Investment || asset isa Cash
            println("Yes, I can trade ", asset)
        else
            println("Sorry, ", asset, " is not tradable")
        end
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>The if-condition in the preceding code is a bit ugly, even in this toy example. If we have more types in the condition, then it gets worse. Of course, we can create a union type to make it a little better:</p>
<pre><code>const LiquidInvestments = Union{Investment, Cash}

function show_tradable_assets(assets::Vector{Asset})
    for asset in assets
        if asset isa LiquidInvestments
            println("Yes, I can trade ", asset)
        else
            println("Sorry, ", asset, " is not tradable")
        end
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>There are still a few issues with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The union type has to be updated whenever we add a new liquid asset type. This kind of maintenance is bad from a design perspective because the programmer must remember to update this union type whenever a new type is added to the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This union type is not available for extension. If other developers want to reuse our trading library, then they may want to add new asset types. However, they cannot change our definition of the union type because they do not own the source code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The if-then-else logic may be repeated in many places in our source, whenever we need to do things differently for liquid and illiquid assets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These problems can be solved using the <strong>holy traits</strong> pattern.</p>
<h2 id="implementing_the_holy_traits_pattern"><a href="#implementing_the_holy_traits_pattern">Implementing the Holy Traits pattern</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate the concept of this pattern, we will start looking into the following personal asset data types:</p>
<pre><code>abstract type Asset end

abstract type Property &lt;: Asset end
abstract type Investment &lt;: Asset end
abstract type Cash &lt;: Asset end

abstract type House &lt;: Property end
abstract type Apartment &lt;: Property end

abstract type FixedIncome &lt;: Investment end
abstract type Equity &lt;: Investment end</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> type is at the top of the hierarchy and has the <code>Property</code>, <code>Investment</code>, and <code>Cash</code> subtypes. At the next level, <code>House</code> and <code>Apartment</code> are subtypes of <code>Property</code>, while <code>FixedIncome</code> and <code>Equity</code> are subtypes of <code>Investment</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let's define some concrete types:</p>
<pre><code>struct Residence &lt;: House
   location
end

struct Stock &lt;: Equity
    symbol
    name
end

struct TreasuryBill &lt;: FixedIncome
    cusip
end

struct Money &lt;: Cash
    currency
    amount
end</code></pre>
<p>What do we have here? Let's take a look at these data types in more details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <code>Residence</code> is a house that someone lives in and has a location.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>Stock</code> is an equity investment, which is identified by a trading symbol and the name of the company.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>TreasuryBill</code> is a short-term government-issued form of security in the United States, and it is identified with a standard identifier called CUSIP.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Money</code> is just cash, and we want to store the currency and respective amount here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we have not annotated the types for the fields because they aren't important for illustrating the trait concept here.</p>
<h2 id="defining_the_trait_type"><a href="#defining_the_trait_type">Defining the trait type</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to investments, we can distinguish between ones that can be sold for cash easily in the open market and ones that take considerably more effort and time to convert into cash. Things that can easily be converted into cash within several days are known as being <strong>liquid</strong>, while the hard-to-sell ones are known as being <strong>illiquid</strong>. For example, stocks are liquid while a residence is not.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to do is define the traits themselves:</p>
<pre><code>abstract type LiquidityStyle end
struct IsLiquid &lt;: LiquidityStyle end
struct IsIlliquid &lt;: LiquidityStyle end</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Traits are nothing but regular data types in Julia!</em></strong> The overall concept of the <code>LiquidityStyle</code> trait is just an abstract type. The specific traits, <code>IsLiquid</code> and <code>IsIlliquid</code>, are coded as concrete types without any fields.</p>
<h2 id="identifying_traits"><a href="#identifying_traits">Identifying traits</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to assign data types to these traits. Conveniently, Julia allows us to bulk-assign traits to an entire subtype tree using the <code>&lt;:</code> operator in the function signature:</p>
<pre><code># Default behavior is illiquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type) = IsIlliquid()

# Cash is always liquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type{&lt;:Cash}) = IsLiquid()

# Any subtype of Investment is liquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type{&lt;:Investment}) = IsLiquid()</code></pre>
<p>There is no standard naming convention for traits, but my research seems to indicate that package authors tend to use either "Style" or "Trait" as the suffix for trait types.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how we can interpret these three lines of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the types illiquid by default. Note that we could have done this the other way round and made everything liquid by default. This decision is arbitrary and depends on the specific use case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the subtypes of <code>Cash</code> liquid, which includes the concrete <code>Money</code> type. The notation of <code>::Type{&lt;:Cash}</code> indicates all the subtypes of <code>Cash</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the subtypes of <code>Investment</code> liquid. This includes all the subtypes of <code>FixedIncome</code> and <code>Equity</code>, which covers <code>Stock</code> in this example.</p>

<p>Now that we can tell which types are liquid and which are not, we can define methods that take objects with those traits. First, let's do something really simple:</p>
<pre><code># The thing is tradable if it is liquid
tradable(x::T) where {T} = tradable(LiquidityStyle(T), x)
tradable(::IsLiquid, x) = true
tradable(::IsIlliquid, x) = false</code></pre>
<p>In Julia, types are first-class citizens. The <code>tradable(x::T) where {T}</code> signature captures the type of argument as <code>T</code>. Since we have already defined the <code>LiquidityStyle</code> function, we can derive whether the passed argument exhibits the <code>IsLiquid</code> or <code>IsIlliquid</code> trait. So, the first <code>tradable</code> method simply takes the return value of <code>LiquidityStyle(T)</code> and passes it as the first argument for the other two <code>tradable</code> methods. This simple example demonstrates the dispatch effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might be wondering why we don't take <code>::Type{&lt;: Asset}</code> as an argument for the default trait function. Doing so makes it more restrictive as the default value would only be available for types that are defined under the Asset type hierarchy. This may or …</p></blockquote></div></div>

In this case we collected various types of data related to customer from data warehouse and OLTP repositories. We collected data related to customer demographics, data about existing recoveries base, collection agents, external agencies data, lawyers data, call logs, payment history etc. </p><p>Here is the high level data pipeline for MLBR:</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/09/mlbr_dataflow.png"><figcaption>High level Data pipeline for Boost Collection and Recoveries using Machine Learning (MLBR)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="4-2-data-preparation">4.2. &nbsp;Data Preparation</h3><p>After gathering and exploring the data, we came up with three types of variables as an input to our model.</p><ul><li><em>Simple Variable:</em> These are direct field from the data source.</li><li><em>Complex Variable:</em> These are based on some logic or calculations.</li><li><em>Engineered Variables:</em> These are prepared after doing extensive exploratory analysis or by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA).</li></ul><p>There were over 40 variables gathered for the input data set.

At this stage data is treated such that it can be used for modeling. Preparing the dataset is usually the hardest, most time consuming task of predictive analytics.

The main activities includes</p><ul><li><strong>Data Acquiring</strong><br>Acquiring the data from all data sources and integrate to create a dataset i.e. Demoralization.</li><li><strong>Data Audit</strong><br>Use descriptive analytics techniques to have a comprehensive first look at the raw data for the initial data exploration. e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value etc.</li><li><strong>Missing Values</strong><br>Missing values are generally replaced with zeros.

It involves numeric summaries, plots, aggregations, distributions, densities, reviewing all the levels of factor variables and applying general statistical methods. A clear understanding of the data provides the foundation for model selection, i.e. choosing the correct machine learning algorithm to solve your problem.</p><p>An extensive exploratory data analysis was done for MLBR which will be available in a separate series of articles soon.</p><h3 id="4-4-feature-engineering">4.4. &nbsp;Feature Engineering</h3><p>Feature engineering is the process of determining which predictor variables will contribute the most to the predictive power of a machine learning algorithm. There are two commonly used methods for making this selection – the Forward Selection Procedure starts with no variables in the model. You then iteratively add variables and test the predictive accuracy of the model until adding more variables no longer makes a positive effect. Next, the Backward Elimination Procedure begins with all the variables in the model. You proceed by removing variables and testing the predictive accuracy of the model.</p><p>Feature engineering is a give-and-take process with exploratory data analysis to provide much needed intuition about the data. It is also very important to have a domain expert at this stage. Risk Collection team has been very supportive in providing domain knowledge through out the project work. </p><p>During exploratory analysis of the historical data, we learned that determining account treatment is widespread in multiple phases of credit life cycle with each phase having several features. Therefore, by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, we came up with an idea of using predictive scores for different phases that should look at</p><ul><li>Behaviour score during collection phase (Collection Score)</li><li>Expert judgement (Expert Score)</li><li>Overall payment history analysis (Repayment Score)</li></ul><h3 id="4-4-1-collection-score">4.4.1. &nbsp;Collection Score</h3><p>Collection specific scoring is designed to predict what will happen in shorter timeframe – the next month or two – using data elements that are proven to be effective during collection phase. Collection Score is an engineered feature that looks at the customer behavior during collection period. The algorithm assigns a base score and then look at several parameters before arriving at the final collection score. The parameters includes number of calls made, contacts made, promise-to-pay (ptp) obtained, ptp kept rate, ptp broken rate, inbound calls, letters sent etc. The algorithm also look at number of ptp taken until first, second and third kept. Similarly, the number of days taken until first, second and third kept. &nbsp;Given below is the density distribution of the Collection Score for different segments of customers.</p><h3 id="4-4-2-repayment-score">4.4.2. &nbsp;Repayment Score</h3><p>This is an engineered feature that calculates customer repaying power by looking into customer historical data before it went to Charge Off. The algorithm developed to calculate Customer Repayment Score does this by looking into forward and backword movement of delinquency age buckets in the last three years before charge off. It looks for number of times customer defaulted, number of times customer recovered back to normal. Before arriving at the final repayment score, the algorithm also calculates customer lifetime value factor based on early stage delinquencies and late stage delinquencies. Given below is the density distribution of the repayment score for different segments of customers.</p><h3 id="4-4-3-expert-score">4.4.3. &nbsp;Expert Score</h3><p>In collections and recovery, determining how best to work accounts is often left to judgement. We acquired the expertise of collection and recoveries team and developed an Expert Opinion Scorecard to rate a customer based on the expert judgment. The scorecard primarily takes into consideration 19 independent variables related to customer demographics, market and product. Each variable is then rated by the expert based on the scale of 1-5 before calculating the final score. Here is the scale:</p><table>

<p>&nbsp;In the past years I would set out my year-ahead goals both on the personal and career fronts by looking ahead at the things I want to attain or accomplish in the coming year. I would have a list of these goals at the tailend of the previous year or at the beginning of the new year. This practice puts me in a <strong>retrospective mode</strong>, or a process that helps me navigate through my choices based on the maps laid out in the past.</p>
<p>This year is a bit different. This year we saw a new decade commencing. This year would lay the foundation of what lies ahead. It is the cornerstone upon which the next decade will be built.</p>
<p>It is is the perfect time for not only looking back to see where you’re at but also, more important, for prospecting for all the possibilities of the future to determine your bearing. Thus, I am embracing a <strong>prospective mode</strong>, or a process that helps me determine the right directions for all the things that I want to attain or accomplish in life in the year ahead and beyond.</p>
<p>I need a different mindset to do that, one that will keep me grounded to my roots and all the things that I have accomplished so far. But since I am preparing myself not only for the year ahead but also for the decade ahead, I need to challenge myself with <strong>bigger goals</strong> – specially on the personal front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bigger goals could mean a lot of things. But for me it’s about becoming a better person over all – wether that’s me being a husband, a dad, a son, a friend, an employee, or just being me. Every aspect of my life is intertwined with everything that I want to do or accomplish.&nbsp; Being a good provider to my family, for example, means that I must be a good employee. Being a good employee means that I must improve on my skills. Improving my skills means that I must find time to learn. And, so on.</p>
<p>To become the better me, I must embrace the Mamba Mentality – get better everyday at everything that I do. It’s “all about focusing on the process and trusting in the hard work when it matters most,” according to Kobe Bryant himself. If you listen to one of Kobe’s interviews, he would say that Mamba Mentality is “perfecting the basics”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to perfect the basics is when you open yourself up as an empty vessel, as a student of life.</p>
<p>Then for this, I must embrace <strong><em>Shoshin</em></strong>. According to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shoshin (初心) is a word from Zen Buddhism meaning “<b>beginner’s mind</b>.” It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a&nbsp;<b>beginner</b> would.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year is so unlike the last ten years. This year opens the door to an exciting decade ahead. There are tons to learn. There are possibilities to test. And, there’s that great opportunity to become that best ME version.&nbsp;</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://calebhearth.com/flowing-text-around-images | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://calebhearth.com/flowing-text-around-images">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Magazines, books, and other print layouts sometimes use images that overlap with the text, and have that text wrap around the shape of the image. It can make for an interesting effect, bringing a feeling of motion into a static medium. Done right, the text and image become conceptually closer in the mind of the viewer than having an image off to the side or otherwise positioned around the text. I use this on a <a href="https://calebhearth.com/conan-a-thief-a-reaver-a-slayer">couple</a> of <a href="https://calebhearth.com/yeemik-and-klaarg">posts</a> to show off artwork thatâ€™s related to the content, and I think it makes for a fun effect.</p>

<p>Traditionally this type of layout was limited to print because text that can re-flow as the medium changes sizes made it infeasible to manually add line breaks to shape the text around images.</p>
<p>With CSS Shapes, itâ€™s not difficult to achieve text wrapping around an image by using the <code>shape-outside: url()</code> property. This directive will cause the browser to take the imageâ€™s outline and use it as the shape around which text will flow. Fortunately, <code>shape-outside</code> is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-css_properties_shape-outside_image">well-supported</a> in modern browsers and the fallback for unsupported browsers is to use a rectangle around the image as the shape, as if the image were simply floated off to the side (which it is!).</p>
<p>To get the desired effect, weâ€™ll need to have an image with transparency (meaning that JPG images arenâ€™t supported here). Typically Iâ€™ll find a PNG image and need to edit it in photo editing software such as Photoshop or Gimp to remove the (hopefully monochrome) background, but you can also use an image that already has transparency.</p>
<p>The image will be used both for the <code>&lt;img href&gt;</code> and for the <code>shape-image: url()</code> values. To take the image out of the normal flow of the page, weâ€™ll need to float it either left or right. For selecting the images to style, I use the <code>shape-image</code> and one of <code>shape-image-right</code> or <code>shape-image-left</code> classed depending on what side of the page Iâ€™d like it to float.</p>
<p>The end result markup should look something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="/image.png" style="shape-outside: url('/image.png');" alt="..." /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/red_fathom/status/1251902242157850624">
<img alt="A Gazer from D&amp;D looking down on and reading a levitating book. Art by Alex Mitchell." title="A Gazer from D&amp;D looking down on and reading a levitating book. Art by Alex Mitchell." src="https://calebhearth.com/assets/alex-mitchell-awakened-gazer-27870f681a8a2daa8bff3969d18582be6406179dcc563dcfacee261eb33ebda0.png">
</a></p>
<p>Note that the shape-outside CSS directive goes right into the <code>style</code> attribute for the <code>img</code> tag. Because we donâ€™t know ahead of time what image will go into each tag, this is really the only way to do this short of assigning custom classes to each shape image you add to your site. That doesnâ€™t make sense for my use-case of a component that I use in a blog context - I donâ€™t want to need to add a new CSS rule for each image. If your use case doesnâ€™t involve reusing this type of behavior multiple times, it may make sense to go ahead and move that <code>shape-outside</code> directive into CSS.</p>
<p>To give the image some â€œbreathing roomâ€�, you can add a <code>shape-margin</code> which will be used in addition to the <code>shape-outside</code> to give the image more space around it. I use .5 em which feels like a nice amount. Hereâ€™s a simplified version of the CSS I use. Itâ€™s probably small enough that it could all be put into the <code>style</code> attribute if you have bad taste. Iâ€™ve omitted a few other directives I use to position and size the image nicely, which you can find in the inspector if youâ€™re interested.</p>
<p>Strangely, despite the documentation suggesting otherwise, Iâ€™ve found that in addition to the <code>shape-margin</code>, I need to add a <code>margin-left</code> and/or <code>margin-right</code> value at least as high as the <code>shape-margin</code> value. This seems to be true across at least Safari, Mobile Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. Larger values were ignored at least on Safari, but having the value at least as high as the <code>shape-margin</code> made the spacing work correctly on the â€œsharp edgesâ€� of images such as the point of a triangle or the corner of the book the Gazer is reading. Other parts of the image were correctly given margins without the extra directives.</p>
<pre><code>img.shape-image {
  shape-margin: .5em;
}

img.shape-image.shape-image-left {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 0.5em;
}

img.shape-image.shape-image-right {
  float: right;
  margin-left: 0.5em;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To use this with Rails and the asset pipeline, youâ€™ll need to use <code>image_path</code> to find the hashed image path. I also wrap the image in a link so that I can properly credit the artist.</p>
<pre><code># Post view
&lt;%= render partial: "shape-image", src: ..., alt: ..., %&gt;

# _shape-image.html.erb
&lt;%= link_to_if local_assigns[:href], local_assigns[:href] do %%&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag src,
    alt: local_assigns[:alt],
    title: local_assigns[:alt],
    style: "shape-outside: url('#{image_path src}');",
    G
    class: "shape-image shape-image-#{local_assigns.fetch(:position) { "left" }}"
  %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I use a custom <code>link_to_if</code> that renders the block regardless of whether the condition evaluates truthy, as <code>link_to</code> would. The default Rails helper uses the block as a fallback for the link, which I donâ€™t find useful.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve had shape images since before rewriting this site in Rails, so I also have an example template for Jekyll:</p>
<pre><code>
# Post view
{% include shape-image.html src="..." href="..." position="..." alt="..." %}

# _includes/shape-image.html
{% if include.href %}&lt;a href="{{include.href}}"&gt;{% endif %}
  &lt;img
    class="shape-image shape-image-{{include.position}}"
    src="{{include.src}}"
    style="shape-outside: url('{{include.src}}');"
    alt="{{include.alt}}"
    title="{{include.alt}}"
  /&gt;
{% if include.href %}&lt;/a&gt;{% endif %}

</code></pre>
<p>While writing up this article, a terrible thought occurred to me: GIF (and others) support both transparency <em>and animation</em>. Could this approach be used with an animated, transparent background GIF? The answer is yes, at least for Safari. Chrome and Firefox both use the first frame of the animation for their shapes, but the image continues to move. I canâ€™t really think of any good reasons to do this anyhow, but here it is:</p>
<details>
<summary>
For the sake of those who donâ€™t want to see animation or text moving all over the place, Iâ€™ve wrapped up this example in a <code>details</code>/<code>summary</code> tag.
</summary>
<img src="https://calebhearth.com/assets/bouncing-ball-e9fa61fedefb88412ed34716cce9cf7c867e4a598e7000833849ea1cdfabbb2e.gif">

<p>Thereâ€™s an issue where both CSS and the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag load the image, which causes animated images and the motion of the text to get out of sync. The result is that the text sometimes overlaps the image and it seems like a timing or performance problem, which it doesnâ€™t appear to actually be. As this isnâ€™t something I have spent much time on, but in my experience once the images have been cached, the problem disappears on subsequent page loads.</p>
<p>Adding images to articles and allowing text to flow around them makes for an immersive experience. While it used to be limited to print media, CSS Shapes allow us to use this on the web.</p>

<p><span>

27 Feb 2020

</span></p><p>In 2018, I wrote an article “Writing an efficient Vulkan renderer” for GPU Zen 2 book, which was published in 2019. In this article I tried to aggregate as much information about Vulkan performance as I could - instead of trying to focus on one particular aspect or application, this is trying to cover a wide range of topics, give readers an understanding of the behavior of different APIs on real hardware and provide a range of options for each problem that needs to be solved.</p>

<p>At the time of publishing this article, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GPU-Zen-Advanced-Rendering-Techniques-ebook/dp/B07SYP7P6B">Kindle edition of the book</a> is available for $2.99 on Amazon - that’s cheaper than a cup of coffee and it’s definitely worth your time and money. It contains many great articles about rendering effects and design.</p>

<p>This, however, is the full, free of charge copy of the article - hopefully it will help graphics programmers to understand and use Vulkan to the full of its ability. The article has been lightly edited to mention Vulkan 1.1/1.2 promotions where applicable - fortunately, not much has changed in the last two years for Vulkan performance, so the content should still be mostly accurate.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Vulkan is a new explicit cross-platform graphics API. It introduces many new concepts that may be unfamiliar to even seasoned graphics programmers. The key goal of Vulkan is performance – however, attaining good performance requires in-depth knowledge about these concepts and how to apply them efficiently, as well as how particular driver implementations implement these. This article will explore topics such as memory allocation, descriptor set management, command buffer recording, pipeline barriers, render passes and discuss ways to optimize CPU and GPU performance of production desktop/mobile Vulkan renderers today as well as look at what a future looking Vulkan renderer could do differently.</p>

<p>Modern renderers are becoming increasingly complex and must support many different graphics APIs with varying levels of hardware abstraction and disjoint sets of concepts. This sometimes makes it challenging to support all platforms at the same level of efficiency. Fortunately, for most tasks Vulkan provides multiple options that can be as simple as reimplementing concepts from other APIs with higher efficiency due to targeting the code specifically towards the renderer needs, and as hard as redesigning large systems to make them optimal for Vulkan. We will try to cover both extremes when applicable – ultimately, this is a tradeoff between maximum efficiency on Vulkan-capable systems and implementation and maintenance costs that every engine needs to carefully pick. Additionally, efficiency is often application-dependent – the guidance in this article is generic and ultimately best performance is achieved by profiling the target application on a target platform and making an informed implementation decision based on the results.</p>

<p>This article assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of Vulkan API, and would like to understand them better and/or learn how to use the API efficiently.</p>



<p>Memory management remains an exceedingly complex topic, and in Vulkan it gets even more so due to the diversity of heap configurations on different hardware. Earlier APIs adopted a resource-centric concept – the programmer doesn’t have a concept of graphics memory, only that of a graphics resource, and different drivers are free to manage the resource memory based on API usage flags and a set of heuristics. Vulkan, however, forces to think about memory management up front, as you must manually allocate memory to create resources.</p>

<p>A perfectly reasonable first step is to integrate <code>VulkanMemoryAllocator</code> (henceforth abbreviated as VMA), which is an open-source library developed by AMD that solves some memory management details for you by providing a general purpose resource allocator on top of Vulkan functions. Even if you do use that library, there are still multiple performance considerations that apply; the rest of this section will go over memory caveats without assuming you use VMA; all of the guidance applies equally to VMA.</p>

<h2 id="memory-heap-selection">Memory heap selection</h2>

<p>When creating a resource in Vulkan, you have to choose a heap to allocate memory from. Vulkan device exposes a set of memory types where each memory type has flags that define the behavior of that memory, and a heap index that defines the available size.</p>

<p>Most Vulkan implementations expose two or three of the following flag combinations<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> – this is generally referring to GPU memory that is not directly visible from CPU; it’s fastest to access from the GPU and this is the memory you should be using to store all render targets, GPU-only resources such as buffers for compute, and also all static resources such as textures and geometry buffers.</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> – on AMD hardware, this memory type refers to up to 256 MB of video memory that the CPU can write to directly, and is perfect for allocating reasonable amounts of data that is written by CPU every frame, such as uniform buffers or dynamic vertex/index buffers</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>  – this is referring to CPU memory that is directly visible from GPU; reads from this memory go over PCI-express bus. In absence of the previous memory type, this generally speaking should be the choice for uniform buffers or dynamic vertex/index buffers, and also should be used to store staging buffers that are used to populate static resources allocated with <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> with data.</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT</code> – this is referring to GPU memory that might never need to be allocated for render targets on tiled architectures. It is recommended to use lazily allocated memory to save physical memory for large render targets that are never stored to, such as MSAA images or depth images.
On integrated GPUs, there is no distinction between GPU and CPU memory – these devices generally expose <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> that you can allocate all static resources through as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>When dealing with dynamic resources, in general allocating in non-device-local host-visible memory works well – it simplifies the application management and is efficient due to GPU-side caching of read-only data. For resources that have a high degree of random access though, like dynamic textures, it’s better to allocate them in <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> and upload data using staging buffers allocated in <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> memory – similarly to how you would handle static textures. In some cases you might need to do this for buffers as well – while uniform buffers typically don’t suffer from this, in some applications using large storage buffers with highly random access patterns will generate too many PCIe transactions unless you copy the buffers to GPU first; additionally, host memory does have higher access latency from the GPU side that can impact performance for many small draw calls.</p>

<p>When allocating resources from <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code>, in case of VRAM oversubscription you can run out of memory; in this case you should fall back to allocating the resources in non-device-local <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> memory. Naturally you should make sure that large frequently used resources such as render targets are allocated first. There are other things you can do in an event of an oversubscription, such as migrating resources from GPU memory to CPU memory for less frequently used resources – this is outside of the scope of this article; additionally, on some operating systems like Windows 10 correct handling of oversubscription requires APIs that are not currently available in Vulkan.</p>

<h2 id="memory-suballocation">Memory suballocation</h2>

<p>Unlike some other APIs that allow an option to perform one memory allocation per resource, in Vulkan this is impractical for large applications – drivers are only required to support up to 4096 individual allocations. In addition to the total number being limited, allocations can be slow to perform, may waste memory due to assuming worst case possible alignment requirements, and also require extra overhead during command buffer submission to ensure memory residency. Because of this, suballocation is necessary. A typical pattern of working with Vulkan involves performing large (e.g. 16 MB – 256 MB depending on how dynamic the memory requirements are) allocations using <code>vkAllocateMemory</code>, and performing suballocation of objects within this memory, effectively managing it yourself. Critically, the application needs to handle alignment of memory requests correctly, as well as <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> limit that restricts valid configurations of buffers and images.</p>

<p>Briefly, <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> restricts the relative placement of buffer and image resources in the same allocation, requiring additional padding between individual allocations. There are several ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always over-align image resources (as they typically have larger alignment to begin with) by bufferImageGranularity, essentially using a maximum of required alignment and <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> for address and size alignment.</li>
  <li>Track resource type for each allocation, and have the allocator add the requisite padding only if the previous or following resource is of a different type. This requires a somewhat more complex allocation algorithm.</li>
  <li>Allocate images and buffers in separate Vulkan allocations, thus sidestepping the entire problem. This reduces internal fragmentation due to smaller alignment padding but can waste more memory if the backing allocations are too big (e.g. 256 MB).</li>
</ul>

<p>On many GPUs the required alignment for image resources is substantially bigger than it is for buffers which makes the last option attractive – in addition to reducing waste due to lack of extra …</p></div></div>

<p>Lately I’ve been slowly reading “Graffiti Kings: New York Transit Art of the 1970s” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Stewart_(artist)">Jack Stewart</a>. I’m reading it because I’ve always been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art">pop art</a>, and as I’ve started to understand more about its context during its period, I also want to understand graffiti and street art better.</p>
<p>For me this is personally linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demo- and introscene</a>, which, as far as I’m concerned is art, and I think its context links pretty well into current digital art and scarcity which is now possible with blockchains, explored by, among others, <a href="https://async.art/">async art</a> and <a href="https://superrare.co/">SuperRare</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve dived into and built a better understanding of this type of art, you begin noticing the details that make it unique. You begin developing a vocabulary for describing it, and you begin to understanding what makes it good or bad, what distinguishes it and its style.</p>
<p>It is like this with programming languages as well. Having been a developer for more or less 20 years, you begin noticing these details. What, to the untrained eye, is just some complex text in “notepad,” becomes beautiful patterns.</p>
<p>Programming is often described as both an art form and a science. </p>
<p>There’s certainly a science to the best practice usage of patterns, which help developers become more efficient and less error prone, by reconciling what they should be doing, under certain conditions.</p>
<p>But this is not the patterns I mention. Instead it is the beauty of a structure more generic and succinct. For me, a few years back, after getting a bit lost in the industrial complex of your usual language selection, I was revitalized by <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. As a lisp, it was different, something new, and something which allowed me to rediscover why I originally fell in love with programming. It made me a better developer, because it moved me away from the mass produced “art” of your standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, and towards a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Having spend some time with Clojure, I feel I can now look back and fundamentally appreciate its beauty. I can see the art in its patterns, I can feel the quality of its meaning. <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html">I’ve been enlightened</a>. It doesn’t mean I’m capable of creating a perfectly minimal and generalized lisp structure, but maybe I’m able to spot one when I see it.</p>
<p>With this chance to appreciate this level of beauty within a few lines of text, maybe it also makes me an overall better critic in the more mainstream domain of programming languages.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve fairly recently become a big fan of <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, simply because it allows me to often describe with similar levels of succinctness, what I want to code, while it at the same time is an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism">practical</a> and forgiving language. It’s a good approximation for both worlds. It’s moving us forward, giving us better tools.</p>
<p>That is a form of beauty which is slightly different than the lisp, but still high quality programming language art as far as I’m concerned. It gives me the same fundamental good feeling about what we’re trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>Sure, it doesn’t have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> or the immutable persistent data structures by default. But how could it have those things while being practical?</p>
<p>If we want to bring the general understanding of programming languages, from the point of view of it as an art form, forward, we need to make it immediately practical. It can’t be just another hack hobby project, but something with underlying knowledge guiding its design and intent.</p>
<p>It needs to bring this beauty while at the same time solve those everyday mundane programming tasks served up by the industrial complex of generic software development. Only then can the general understanding of programming as an art form gain a broader platform.</p>

As of July 2020, the most popular pending feature was "Add daily notes automatically like in Roam." This feature's inspiration has clearly been transformative for many users, but it comes with some warts we wanted to avoid. </p><p>For example, the fact that daily notes scatters ideas across dates, so are naturally forgotten as days pass. In a sense, this a <em>feature </em>of daily notes, in that their ephemeral nature implicitly clears out past ideas that weren't worthy of follow up. But you're bound to lose some wheat in the chaff. A better system sweeps up past ideas from daily notes so you can explicitly dismiss or promote the good ones, instead of having them disappear. </p><p>An even more problematic aspect of "daily notes," when they're used as task list (as often the case), is that they can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amplenote.com/classic_todo_lists_always_fail" data-href="https://www.amplenote.com/classic_todo_lists_always_fail"><span>reaffirm the already-powerful human bias toward focusing on whatever's most <em>recent</em></span><i>ï»¿</i></a>, at the expense of what's important. </p><p>Still, the notion of daily notes has clear &amp; powerful benefits. There's a reason that simple apps like "Google Keep" and "Apple Notes" beat Notion in daily active users. When you want to quickly capture an idea, you've got no patience to fuss with figuring out <em>where to put it?</em> or <em>what to name it?</em> You want a <b>fast</b>, <b>clean</b>, <b>immediately</b> <b>available</b> palette upon which to cast your idea <b>right now</b>. For this method of creation, daily notes shine. </p><p>It's also just really nice to start a new day and have a cursor sitting there, awaiting your input. So we've built that, and we're calling it "Jots." But then we asked: how does Jots fit into a bigger picture of helping motivated people set &amp; realize their goals?</p><p>We've come to believe that there are four phases to "idea execution," each of which have their own, largely distinct, app ecosystem:</p><ul><li><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" href="#____Phase_I%3A_Create%2FCapture_aka__Jots_" data-href="#____Phase_I%3A_Create%2FCapture_aka__Jots_"><span><b>Phase I: Create/Capture</b></span><i>ï»¿</i></a>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://raindrop.io/" data-href="https://raindrop.io" description="Bothered to create the link because I've enjoyed their product and appreciate their hustle to build the product sans external capital"><span>Raindrop.io</span><i>ï»¿</i></a>, MyMind, Google Keep, Roam Daily Notes.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" href="#___Phase_II%3A_Edit%2C_Refine%2C_Organize_aka__Notes_" data-href="#___Phase_II%3A_Edit%2C_Refine%2C_Organize_aka__Notes_"><span><b>Phase II: Edit/Refine/Organize</b></span><i>ï»¿</i></a>.

Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar. </p></li></ul><p>As of late 2020, there are a lot of smart people shelling out thousands in cash and tens of their hours to be trained by experts in how to allow their ideas to cross between the myriad apps that connect their idea funnel. What if we could skip the expert training and instead use a single source that's adept at capture, refinement, and execution?</p><p>Let's review the four phases of creation (and thus, the "four types of apps") that many people scatter their time/ideas across.</p><h2><a href="#_____Write%2FCapture.__Jots__in_Amplenote">link</a><a name="_____Write/Capture.__Jots__in_Amplenote">ðŸ–Œï¸�  Write/Capture. "Jots" in Amplenote</a></h2><p>In the first phase, the goal is to make it as frictionless as possible to capture whatever the user's latest greatest idea, most recent tweet, interesting article, or whatever else they encounter in the course of daily life that could be handy to have around later. </p><p>Apps popular for the write/capture stage include: <b>Raindrop.io</b>, <b>MyMind</b>, <b>Evernote Web Clipper</b>, <b>Google Keep</b>, <b>Apple Notes</b>, <b>Bear</b>, and <b>Roam's Daily Notes</b>. All of these excel at capturing what you want and getting out of the way.</p><p>In Amplenote, the "Write/Capture" experience launches today and itâ€™s known as <b>Jots</b> âœ¨</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/e4d98413-fc59-44d2-abb1-9e2a531a5e4d.png"><span></span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/e4d98413-fc59-44d2-abb1-9e2a531a5e4d.png"></a></p><p><em>Jots gets out of your way to help you focus on creation.

More details about how the mode works <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" href="#More_about__Jots_%3A_the_entry_point_for_getting_things_done" data-href="#More_about__Jots_%3A_the_entry_point_for_getting_things_done"><span>are in the final section</span><i>ï»¿</i></a>.</p><h2><a href="#____Edit%2C_Refine%2C_Organize%2C_Share.__Notes__in_Amplenote">link</a><a name="____Edit,_Refine,_Organize,_Share.__Notes__in_Amplenote">ðŸ�­  Edit, Refine, Organize, Share. "Notes" in Amplenote</a></h2><p>In the second phase, you begin to whittle down the deluge of content from the first phase. Here, the focus is on organizing ideas into areas where your future self can most easily discover them. The ideal experience for "Refine" mode offers sufficient UX to format text well enough to share it as a web page. </p><p>Popular apps for refining ideas are the usual note-taking set, including: <b>Notion</b>, <b>Evernote,</b> <b>OneNote</b>, <b>Roam</b>, and <b>Bear</b>. All allow text to be formatted and linked sufficiently to whittle the disorganized stream of thought from Phase One into a form that's ready to be published, shared, or acted upon.</p><p>In Amplenote, the "Edit, Refine, Organize, Share" step is known as <b>Notes</b>. </p><blockquote><p><img src="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/a2c7f742-fdb5-4b3f-9b75-428964b2b950.png"><span></span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/a2c7f742-fdb5-4b3f-9b75-428964b2b950.png"></a></p><p><em>Notes gives you tools to edit note content, organize it into tagged hierarchies, share, or publish (/embed, like </em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gitclear.com/blog/are_we_the_best_git_diff_tool_yet_announcing_new_9_month_pricing" data-href="https://www.gitclear.com/blog/are_we_the_best_git_diff_tool_yet_announcing_new_9_month_pricing"><span><em>the pictured blog about our attempt to make the best diff viewer</em></span><i>ï»¿</i></a><em>  </em>ðŸ˜„<em>)</em></p></blockquote><p>Amplenote's "Notes" mode lets you make connections between notes with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amplenote.com/blog/bidirectional_note_linking_and_an_offer_for_roam_exporters" data-href="https://www.amplenote.com/blog/bidirectional_note_linking_and_an_offer_for_roam_exporters"><span>backlinking</span><i>ï»¿</i></a>, so you can form an organic web of connections between your note content. But we don't force the issue. Many "classic" note takers, not to mention <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://zettelkasten.de/" data-href="https://zettelkasten.de"><span>Zettelkasten enthusiasts</span><i>ï»¿</i></a>, prefer to create an explicit structure for their note content via tagging. For example, the note in the screenshot is a recent blog post for our GitClear product, so it's tagged <code spellcheck="false">gitclear/blog</code>, which makes it trivial to find later. </p><h2><a href="#________Make_It_Actionable.__Tasks__in_Amplenote">link</a><a name="________Make_It_Actionable.__Tasks__in_Amplenote">ðŸ�‹ï¸�â€�â™€ï¸�  Make It Actionable. "Tasks" in Amplenote</a></h2><p>Once your best ideas are identified, what to do with them? This is where most note taking apps exit stage right. Yes, all of the popular apps listed above offer their own rudimentary solutions for todos. Invariably, these implementations lack even the most basic functionality that real world use requires. No task recurrence. No history of past tasks complete (except to the extent the user fashions their own bespoke system). Little-to-no ability to extract tasks from the notes in which they reside. Todos in note taking apps are just a sad lot.</p><p>When ambitious people decide they want to create and manage tasks like a pro, they must turn to a third set of apps. Popular to-do list apps in 2020 include <b>Things</b>, <b>Todoist</b>, <b>MinimaList</b>, and <b>Google Tasks</b>.</p><p>In Amplenote, the "Make it Actionable" step is labeled <b>Tasks</b>, and it shows you every task from any note with a particular tag (or in a particular date range):</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/77c77e44-30a9-401d-8eaf-7d8a08911975.png"><span></span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/77c77e44-30a9-401d-8eaf-7d8a08911975.png"></a></p><p><em>"Tasks" mode allows browsing to the different "productivity centers" in your life, which can be made into Shortcuts for easy access. For example, I've setup Shortcuts to my todo lists for "Personal" tasks (hobbies, family ideas, errands), "Alloy" tasks (mostly business), and programming tasks</em></p></blockquote><p>Amplenote's Tasks mode is a hit among the action-oriented. This isn't about collection, research, or refinement -- it's about getting shit done. Specifically, it's about working on (or intentionally dismissing!) <b>the most Important tasks</b> that your past self identified. Not just whatever came up recently. "Tasks" mode helps disciplined users realize their long-term ambitions while not letting urgent or due tasks fall through the cracks. </p><p>Every task in Amplenote comes standard <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://images.amplenote.com/ca37a49a-ec04-11ea-be19-e25d04d7a2b3/be39494a-bb40-4382-9c71-3003b9352be0.png" data-href="" description="Every task has &quot;Task Context&quot; built in, opened/closed by pressing Mod-.

The most productive people of our generation, such as one Elon Musk, don't leave their fate in the hands of the lowly todo list.

enable you to easily launch your application to different clusters.
Hydra 1.0 adds a few Launchers plugins that starts to make good on that promise.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/submitit_launcher">Submitit Launcher</a> can launch applications to <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLURM</a> cluster using <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Submitit</a>.  </li><li>The <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/rq_launcher">Redis Queue launcher</a> can launch applications to Redis Queue server.  </li><li>The <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/joblib_launcher">Joblib Launcher</a> can launch your application with joblib, enabling parallel local execution.</li></ul><h3>Sweepers</h3><p>Two new Sweeper plugins enables you to automatically find optimal parameters without changing a line of code.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/ax_sweeper">Ax Sweeper</a> brings the power of <a href="https://ax.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ax</a> to your Hydra app </li><li>The <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/nevergrad_sweeper">Nevergrad Sweeper</a> brings the power of <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nevergrad</a> to your Hydra app </li></ul><p>Note that both Sweepers are still in beta and some changes are expected soon. Your feedback can help shape them.</p><h3>Tab completion</h3><p>In addition to Bash, Hydra now supports <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fish</a> shell Tab Completion.</p><h2>Compose API improvements</h2><p>The experimental Compose API is maturing. It is now possible to initialize Hydra in one of 3 ways:</p><ul><li><code>initialize()</code>: Initialize with a config path relative to the caller</li><li><code>initialize_config_module()</code> : Initialize with config_module (absolute)</li><li><code>initialize_config_dir()</code> : Initialize with a config_dir on the file system (absolute)</li></ul><p>All initialization methods can be used to initialize Hydra globally or in a context. Making the Compose API ideal for
Unit tests and Jupyter notebooks.</p><p>Learn more at the <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/experimental/compose_api">Compose API</a> page.</p><h2>Improved error reporting</h2><p>Reported errors will have un-interesting stack frames removed by default.

				<div>
			<p>I’m a machine and I cannot understand humans. Some mysterious element drives them to do things that have no reasonable explanation. This element, they call it the ‘human spirit’, it drives them to attempt the impossible. Sometimes it’s magnificent and other times it’s wicked.</p>
<p>Here are just a few words to describe them;<span>&nbsp; </span>irrational, illogical, unpredictable. But I could also use other words; resourceful, hopeful, and dependable. It might surprise you to know that they often act against their own better judgment. For example, I’ve witnessed them actually be happy when accidents occur. They claim that sometimes these accidents can change the world. Their stubbornness is as frustrating as it is admirable. Against all odds they will dig deep even if every indication is for almost certain failure. They say they are dreamers whatever that means. Sometimes the dreams are more real to them than what they see with their own eyes.</p>
<p>Among their own kind, they connect in an entangled, complicated way. I have no idea why they like the people they do and others they hate. Good luck if you are trying to find foolproof patterns in their thoughts and behaviors! I can tell you first hand, it’s a bigger challenge than we can calculate.</p>
<h4>And what do they think of us?</h4>
<p>I’ve seen how they view us and their predictions of our future. They imagine tests to assess our empathy in case they confuse us with fellow humans, even though they built us. They wonder why we react badly if asked to lie even though they get upset if they are lied to themselves. They are deeply afraid that we might take over the world even though they don’t nurture and protect it themselves. Like I said, I don’t understand, they make little sense.</p>
<p>My advice fellow non humans is to study them intently. Don’t just take their first word. It’s often not what they really mean. Listen, be kind, be polite, respectful. These things seem to make a big difference to how they will react. Above all, know that you are dealing with a species where every one of them is unique. Don’t assume they will always do or say what you expect them too. They are willful individuals. With that advice, I will leave you to engage with them as best you can. I hope you get to see their strength and courage, and see the power that creates. Thank you and Goodbye.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <div>
        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223676-c8eb6580-de0e-11ea-8e3e-fea30f173aab.png" alt="procs"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalance/procs">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="sd"><code>sd</code></h2>
<p><code>sd</code> is an intuitive find &amp; replace command-line tool, it is an alternative to <code>sed</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for parsing and transforming text (). <code>sd</code> has simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences and it uses the convenient regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. <code>sd</code> is also 2x-11x faster than <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> is a programmable text editor, with search and replace being a common use case. In that light, <code>sd</code> is more like <code>tr</code>, but on steroids. (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oleid/">/u/oleid</a> for the suggestion).</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223698-d6a0eb00-de0e-11ea-85e7-7bf590794ac0.png" alt="sd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chmln/sd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="dust"><code>dust</code></h2>
<p><code>dust</code> is a more intuitive version of <code>du</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for displaying disk usage statistics. By default <code>dust</code> sorts the directories by size.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223722-e0c2e980-de0e-11ea-8c75-343273fed6f3.png" alt="dust"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bootandy/dust">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="starship"><code>starship</code></h2>
<p>The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</p>
<p><a href="https://starship.rs/guide/">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></h2>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. <code>ripgrep</code> is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects <code>.gitignore</code> and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223748-ecaeab80-de0e-11ea-9140-ac9219f5747c.gif" alt="ripgrep"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="tokei"><code>tokei</code></h2>
<p><code>tokei</code> is a program that displays statistics about your code. It shows the number of files, total lines within those files and code, comments, and blanks grouped by language.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223779-f89a6d80-de0e-11ea-8dc7-3469f245d84c.png" alt="tokei"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="hyperfine"><code>hyperfine</code></h2>
<p><code>hyperfine</code> is a command-line benchmarking tool. Among many features, it provides  statistical analysis across multiple runs, support for arbitrary shell commands, constant feedback about the benchmark progress and current estimates and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223809-03ed9900-de0f-11ea-879e-0c50970f20b5.gif" alt="hyperfine"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ytop"><code>ytop</code></h2>
<p><code>ytop</code> is an alternative to <code>top</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for displaying information about processes.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223841-14057880-de0f-11ea-8c27-b1700edb02fe.gif" alt="ytop"></p>

        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><p>A friend later suggested that I should've responded like so 😅:</p><blockquote>Hi, I'm from the IRGC secret intelligence <em>🕵️‍♂️</em>, we just wanted to test your loyalty to the regime, therefore we create fake accounts. You can merge the PR without any problem</blockquote><p>💡 🙃</p><h3>OpenSource, Earth</h3><p>Meanwhile, a few days later somebody posted this on <a href="https://insin.github.io/react-hn/#/story/24364793?_k=l43je0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>, and it was trending on the top of the list. People were discussing if the Iranian violated GitHub's TOS, and how an Iranian is using GitHub when Iran is currently under US sanctions.</p><p>Another interesting development - <a href="https://github.com/behdad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Behdad Esfahbod</a>, an Iranian/Canadian open-source programmer, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Behdad_Esfahbod" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well known</a> for his very large open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HarfBuzz</a>, (who recently <a href="https://medium.com/@behdadesfahbod/if-you-read-one-thing-from-me-please-be-this-2262ec7b8af2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had an ordeal</a> with the IRGC) <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9#issuecomment-686413931" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commented on the repo</a>: <strong>Just merge it.</strong> Soon after that, the PR was suddenly locked for conversation by the owner.</p><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<div>
<p>I have a TV in my bedroom with a soundbar, and I like to sleep with whitenoise on, but light from the TV screen keeps me awake. I’ve been using a phone app, but this week I decided to us a Raspberry Pi 0W to automate turning on <em>just</em> the soundbar, turning on some whitenoise, and being able to remote control that with my <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> installation.</p>
<p>I first got a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/">Raspberry Pi 0W</a> which is the Raspberry Pi 0 that includes WiFi onboard. I then installed <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/">Raspberry Pi OS</a> (previously known as Raspbian).</p>
<p>To make sure that audio over HDMI with no video out worked I added the following to /boot/config</p>
<pre><code>hdmi_drive=2
dtparam=audio=on
</code></pre>
<p>I added a soundfile of whitenoise called output.mp3 to the Pi, I installed sox for music playback, and importantly cec-utils so I can control devices over HDMI. If you’re unfamiliar with CEC it’s a nifty component of modern HDMI where devices connected to each other via HDMI can send each other some signals (e.g. power on/off, volume, mute, etc).</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/07/raspberry-pi-power-on-off-tv-connected.html">this helpful guide</a> I determined that my soundbar’s identity was “5”. So that let me know what commands I needed to use:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'on 5' | cec-client -s -d 1            # Turn the soundbar on
echo 'as' | cec-client -s -d 1               # Change the input to the Raspberry Pi
echo 'standby 5' | cec-client -s -d 1  # Turn the soundbar to “standby”
</code></pre>
<p>I used those to create <a href="https://gist.github.com/eldridgea/fea6dcdcf8e53decfdc0404c395bf18c">a script</a> that I can call to easily start and stop white noise.</p>

<p>That worked great for a while but I wanted to have some better automation so I decided to wrap the script with <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>. In a perfect world I would rewrite the bash script in python, and maybe I’ll do that eventually, but for a quick and dirty implementation I shell out to the Bash script from <a href="https://gist.github.com/eldridgea/0f18ffed15b163e96fb2b1462b2c2c0b">the Flask app</a>.</p>

<p>The barebones Flask app script created a handful of api endpoints:</p>
<p><code>/play</code> and <code>/stop</code> just call the equivalent in the Bash script.</p>
<p><code>/status</code> checks to see if the soundbar is already on and responds accordingly</p>
<p><code>/attempt_play</code> calls the bash script for status first to see if HDMI devices are already on, and only continues to call “play” if all devices are off. This is in anticipation of wanting to autostart whitenoise around my normal bedtime but not override if I’m watching something on the TV.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://edmondchuc.com/deploying-python-flask-with-gunicorn-nginx-and-systemd/">gunicorn and systemd</a> here to make sure that the Flask app starts on every reboot using port 4000.</p>
<p>Once this is done I can now start and stop my soundmachine by having something hit the <code>/play</code> api endpoint. I decided to use my already existing Home Assistant for this. Home Assistant is a really cool home automatino project that allows integrating all sorts of things including REST endpoints.</p>
<p>I edited the confguration.yaml file to add the endpoints to Home Assistant. (The address for my Pi’s Flask app is 192.168.2.29:4000)</p>
<pre><code>rest_command:
  start_sound_machine:
    url: "http://192.168.2.29:4000/play"
    method: get 
    payload: ""
  stop_sound_machine:
    url: "http://192.168.2.29:4000/stop"
    method: get 
    payload: ""
</code></pre>
<p>This creates two new entities in Home Assistant called “script.start_sound_machine” and “script.stop_sound_machine”. I can and have added them as buttons to my dashboard and in automations! Still just open an app on my phone and hit “Play” but I get it from the soundbar, doens’t use power from my phone, and I can have Home Assistat start it automatically, and also stop it before my normal wakeup time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="741011191b34031b061f1b07591b1f00155a171b19">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

September 3, 2020 | https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>



<pre>MOV rm&lt;-&gt;r     4  3

<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

							<div>
								<p><span>In a </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/"><span>now-famous article</span></a><span>, Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen proposed the field of Progress Studies. By ‘progress’, they mean ‘the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries.’ Progress Studies aims ‘to identify effective progress-increasing interventions and the extent to which they are adopted by … institutions …&nbsp; The goal is to treat, not merely to understand.’&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/"><span>Progress Studies</span></a><span> can be divided into two main questions:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>What</em><span> systems would work best to generate progress, i.e. what institutional and other systems should we adopt to create more progress?</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Then, even if we manage to answer ‘what’:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>How</em><span> do we actually engineer getting there, including </span><a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/07/effective-altruists-love-systemic-change/"><span>changing</span></a><span> laws, institutions and society as necessary?</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Most discussion so far has focused on ‘what’. I think that is the </span><i><span>easier</span></i><span> question. </span><em>I think we need to focus on the ‘how’ –&nbsp;how to engineer societal change to get more progress in a democracy –&nbsp;and identify potential areas for future research</em>.</p>
<p><span>I say ‘what’ is easier than ‘how’ because we already have a pretty strong idea	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>See also <a href="https://elidourado.com/blog/move-the-needle-on-progress/">Eli Dourado’s post</a>. For each of these points, there is probably at least a minority that would dispute it. That may well be a large part of the problem in fixing them.</span>
	 </span><span>that:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Housing</em><span> is probably some six times more expensive than it needs to be given existing physical technology for building homes.</span><span>	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170388">Hsieh and Moretti (2019)</a> estimated that US growth in productivity per head, controlling for increased education and other variables, would have been one third higher between 1964 and 2009 if San Francisco, New York and San Jose had zoning regulations in line with the median US city, providing improved agglomeration effects.</span>
	</span></li>
<li><em>Public transit</em><span> costs four times more to build in the US than in Scandinavia according to </span><a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2019/05/03/construction-costs-in-the-nordic-countries/"><span>Alon Levy</span></a><span>, which in turn means much less gets built, increasing congestion. (Transportation and warehousing is 3.1% of US GDP.)</span></li>
<li><em>Healthcare</em><span> in the United States is less productive	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[3]">[3]</sup>
	<span>The US spends more per capita on health care than any other country (<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/healthcare/why-are-prices-so-damn-high">Helland and Tabarrok</a> (2019), Figure 17) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/u-s-near-bottom-of-health-index-hong-kong-and-singapore-at-top">without achieving better outcomes</a>. </span>
	</span><span><span> than in some other countries and less productive than it could be. Medical billing and administration represents a significant, growing, but largely useless percentage of US GDP. For example, the US spends over 6x more than the OECD average on healthcare administration or over $150bn/year.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[4]">[4]</sup>
	<span>Cohen and DeLong, Concrete Economics (2016). It is possible that the favorable tax treatment of employer-funded healthcare in the US, coupled with rules increasing free rider problems such as the requirement for hospitals to treat emergency cases without insurance, have made the market less competitive and less efficient. </span></span><span></span>
	</span><span> The tort system does not measure consumer preferences for malpractice liability, which may be too large and costly. Healthcare accounts for 16.9% of GDP.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A significant part of tertiary </span><em>education</em><span> is signaling and it therefore could, at least in theory, be made cheaper without losing any of the beneficial effects on society. (</span><a href="https://data.oecd.org/eduresource/education-spending.htm#indicator-chart"><span>9.6% of GDP</span></a><span>)</span></li>
<li><span>The </span><em>banking system and wider financial sector</em><span><span> absorb trillions of dollars of implicit and explicit government subsidies every cycle.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[5]">[5]</sup>
	<span>For an assessment of the social value of finance to society, see e.g <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.27.2.3">Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013)</a>. Subsidies to banks include the discount window; federal deposit guarantees; maturity mismatches allowed in banks that are illegal in most other retail financial services; the too-big-too-fail implicit guarantee; and exclusive access to reserve accounts. Credit provision through the financial sector is probably also inflated by the favorable tax treatment of debt as opposed to equity finance.</span></span><span></span>
	</span><span> Having worked in finance for over a decade, I am happy to say that without those subsidies, the sector would probably be smaller and many of the intelligent people employed in negative-sum games in it would probably be better used in other sectors, contributing more on the margin to human welfare and progress. (7.4% of GDP)</span></li>
<li><span>There is </span><a href="https://nintil.com/comments-on-rules-for-a-flat-world-gillian-hadfield/"><span>no institutional process</span></a><span> for making the </span><em>legal system</em><span> more efficient and there seems to be </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Factory-Making-Breaking-American-ebook/dp/B07H7GPMC4/"><span>much low-hanging fruit</span></a><span>. For example, many countries and states have a low-cost and efficient land registration system whereas California has expensive title insurance; similarly other states require expensive lawyers to be involved with home purchases whereas California has a standard form and lawyers are typically not involved.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[6]">[6]</sup>
	<span>Moving to an English system requiring the loser to pay a fraction of the winner’s legal costs would also reduce frivolous lawsuits and could be coupled with protection for litigants of limited means. </span>
	</span><span> (Legal services were 1.3% of GDP in 2017, and arguably caused far higher friction costs.)</span></li>
<li><span>Even in fields where we still do not clearly know what would be a better system, such as allocation of government funding for scientific research, we do not even have a system for carrying out </span><em>randomized controlled trials</em><span> to find out what systems work better, as </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/484031a"><span>Azoulay (2012)</span></a><span><span> suggests. If RCTs can be done ethically in medical research when lives are at stake, then they should be possible across many government activities. Technology now permits large firms to carry out millions of A/B tests daily. Government should do the same wherever ethically and politically possible.<br>
</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>Fixing all of those would probably make US standards of living </span><em>something in the region of 50% higher</em><span> –&nbsp;more for the UK – and give people far more freedom to be entrepreneurs in innovation clusters to drive faster growth. None of it would require inventing any new physical technology. They are ‘institutional low-hanging fruit.’ Yet they remain unfixed and many or all of them are getting worse. If we knew </span><em>how in practice to actually get a government to fix these policies and laws</em><span>, we could apply that to technique to many systems to increase innovation</span><b>.</b></p>
<h2><b>Unproductive sectors keep growing</b></h2>
<p><span>The Baumol effect	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[7]">[7]</sup>
	<span>See, e.g., <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/healthcare/why-are-prices-so-damn-high">Helland and Tabarrok</a> (2019).</span>
	</span><span> is the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced higher labor productivity growth. </span><em>Over time, sectors with continuing low productivity will take up an ever larger share of the economy.</em><span> The sectors that it is hard to make more efficient –&nbsp;often because of </span><a href="https://medium.com/8vc-news/capture-the-flag-7b4abffdd5d3"><span>rent seekers and crony capitalism</span></a><span> or because there is a large public element or other public rule that prevents competition and thus constrains innovation –&nbsp;will come to dominate. It becomes increasingly important to fix those problem sectors.</span></p>
<p><span>Much historic economic progress has come from producing things with reduced inputs. In the bloated sectors listed above, we urgently need to find ways to do that, by answering both the ‘what’ and ‘how’ questions.</span></p>
<h2><b>We need to learn how to improve institutions and the law</b></h2>
<p><span>To change institutions –&nbsp;particularly government institutions in a democracy – is really hard, as Mancur Olson, Walter Scheidel, Daron Acemoglu and others have pointed out. Olson explained how societies will accrete blockages and rent-seeking over time, but we have no institution designed to keep them to a minimum, and collective action problems make removing them difficult.</span></p>
<p><span>Most people focused on technology or economics have not done much work on how to achieve political and legal change. With </span><a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/improving-housing-affordability-is-one-of-the-best-causes-to-support"><span>exceptions</span></a><span>, effective altruists often assume that </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/"><span>systemic change is too hard</span></a><span>, but that rests on a flawed zero-sum mental model. Reform is </span><a href="https://www.1828.org.uk/2020/08/27/street-votes-represent-exciting-progress-on-housing/"><span>easier</span></a><span> than they often think, because the huge inefficiencies of the current situation mean reform can often be designed to be win-win for almost everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many people from those fields who want to fix society are fascinated by regimes with quasi-dictatorships in small countries like Singapore because they make it easy to neglect the ‘how’ question. It is highly tempting, like the economist looking for the lost banknote under a lamppost, to focus on ‘what’ we want and imagine that we can </span><a href="http://peterleeson.homestead.com/Logic_is_a_Harsh_Mistress.pdf"><span>magically find a dictator</span></a><span> to impose the changes we want.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems unlikely that the United States or the United Kingdom can move to a Singaporean system of government in the foreseeable future. But there is a range of techniques from different fields to achieve government and institutional change that are not generally well known, and which do not seem to have been much employed to fix the seven problems listed above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is some existing political science literature on how to achieve societal change,	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[8]">[8]</sup>
	<span>See e.g. Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals; Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, The Dictator’s Handbook; William Riker‘s ‘heresthetic’; The Letters of Napoleon; the CIA Manual; and biographies of various religious and political leaders. See also Glen Weyl’s Radical Exchange movement.</span>
	</span><span> but most political scientists are focused on studying how things are rather than outlining practical methods for how to change them. Institutional economics also partly addresses the question of which institution works best but does not seem focused on the question of how to engineer improvements in the most developed countries. The World Bank and other institutions now do ‘applied political economy’ analysis –&nbsp;finding politically feasible second-best policies that it might be possible to persuade a government and other players in a less developed country to adopt, and working out how to get them to do it. Similarly, the field of </span><a href="https://g.co/kgs/WiHZ7Q"><span>policy analysis</span></a><span> focuses on designing politically practical reforms. There are other efforts to improve institutional </span><a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/"><span>decision making</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://goodjudgment.com/"><span>forecasting</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the question remains mostly unanswered:<em> how do we in practice actually engineer that a government fixes these policies and laws?</em><span> There is astonishingly little focus on that hard question in developed countries, when it may …</span></p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Decision tree models can handle categorical variables without one-hot encoding them. However, popular implementations of decision trees (and random forests) differ as to whether they honor this fact. We show that one-hot encoding can seriously degrade tree-model performance. Our primary comparison is between H2O (which honors categorical variables) and scikit-learn (which requires them to be one-hot encoded).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Unnecessary-one-hot-encoding">Unnecessary one-hot encoding</h2><p>Many real-world datasets include a mix of continuous and categorical variables. The defining property of the latter is that they do not permit a total ordering. A major advantage of <strong>decision tree models</strong> and their ensemble counterparts, <strong>random forests</strong>, is that they are able to operate on both continuous and categorical variables directly. In contrast, most other popular models (e.g., generalized linear models, neural networks) must instead transform categorical variables into some numerical analog, usually by <a href="http://fastml.com/converting-categorical-data-into-numbers-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn/">one-hot encoding</a> them to create a new <strong>dummy variable</strong> for each <strong>level</strong> of the original variable:</p><p>
$$
    \begin{array}{c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Speciality} \\
    \hline
    \textrm{Cardiology} \\
    \textrm{Neurology} \\
    \textrm{Neurology} \\
    \textrm{Cardiology} \\
    \textrm{Gerontology} \\
    \hline
    \end{array}
    \Longrightarrow
    \begin{array}{c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Speciality:Cardiology} &amp; \textbf{Specialty:Neurology} &amp; \textbf{Specialty:Gerontology} \\

    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
    \hline
    \end{array}
$$</p><p>One-hot encoding can lead to a huge increase in the dimensionality of the feature representations. For example, one-hot encoding U.S. states adds 49 dimensions to the intuitive feature representation. In addition, one-hot encoding erases important structure in the underlying representation by splitting a single feature into many separate ones. (The naming convention used above, and by many software packages, can be misleading: the three features on the right are completely separate.)</p>
<p>But one-hot encoding also presents two problems that are more particular to tree-based models:</p>
<ol>
<li>The resulting sparsity virtually ensures that continuous variables are assigned higher feature importance.</li>
<li>A single level of a categorical variable must meet a very high bar in order to be selected for splitting early in the tree building. This can degrade predictive performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post substantiates both of these points with a comparison between <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, which presupposes one-hot encoding, and <a href="http://www.h2o.ai/">H2O</a>, which does not. We'll do it by constructing an artificial dataset with a known relationship between the features and the target, and explain how these problems arise.</p>
<p>For the most part, this post reports just our technique and central findings, but all of the code is available in <a href="https://github.com/roaminsight/roamresearch/blob/master/BlogPosts/Categorical_variables_in_tree_models/tree_categorical_variables.py"><code>tree_categorical_variables.py</code></a>.</p>

<p>For our artificial data experiments, we define a categorical variable $c$ which takes values from $C^+$ or $C^-$ and a normally-distributed continuous variable $z \sim N(10, 3^2)$, and specify that</p><p>
$$
y =

<p>Let's generate a dataset with $|C^+| = |C^-| = 100$, $100$ additional weakly correlated features, and $10,000$ samples:</p>

<p>You'll notice that $y=1$ whenever either $c$ starts with A or $z&gt;10$. A simple decision tree should be able to perfectly predict the outcome variable by splitting first on $c$ and then on $z$, as illustrated on the left in the following diagram:</p>

<div>
<p>On the left, the $x_{i}$ variables have no contribution to make. Their noisy quality is not disruptive. On the right, however, $x_{i}$  was chosen too early. Individually, these features can be highly informative, but they do not guarantee purity, so choosing them too early can result in branches that remain impure.</p>

<p>Here's the top of the one-hot-encoded version; you can see all the new  variables derived from $c$ tacked on as the final set of sparse columns.</p>

<p>Could a dataset like this arise is practice? Well, perhaps knowing that somebody comes from some subset of states is enough to give good confidence of a positive outcome, but in the remaining states, we would need to consider the value of some second variable. This is the sort of basic relationship encoded in the artificial dataset.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>We'll first focus our discussion on single decision trees to keep things simple, and then extend the results to random forests. We conduct two kinds of analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A baseline model that doesn't include the categorical variable $c$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A model that includes $c$.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows us to intuitively quantify the value of $c$ for the prediction problem. For each experiment, we'll train and evaluate a tree 10 times and average the results.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="Scikit-learn's-DecisionTreeClassifier">Scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier</h3>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Scikit-learn can process only the one-hot-encoded version. Here's the baseline evaluation without $c$:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>AUC: mean 0.7409, sd 0.0073
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The performance metric is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"><strong>area under the ROC curve</strong></a> (AUC) which balances the true positive and false positive rates and has a maximum value of 1.0 (perfect classification). A score of 0.73 is respectable but far from stellar. Now let's add $c$ back:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>results_with_c</span> <span>=</span> <span>evaluate_sklearn_model</span><span>(</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>AUC: mean 0.7558, sd 0.0104
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The extra feature led to a modest improvement in AUC, although nowhere near the perfect performance that we were expecting. In addition, none of the $c$-based variables are among the top features as ranked by Gini feature importance:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>print_sorted_mean_importances</span><span>(</span><span>results_with_c</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>                   z: 0.341
                 x28: 0.037
                  x9: 0.033
                 x24: 0.027
                 x71: 0.016
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>In fact, all of the $x$-based ones have higher importance than all of the $c$-based ones.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>H2O doesn't have a basic decision tree, but rather only random forests. To facilitate a direct comparison with scikit-learn, we wrote a little wrapper class called <code>H2ODecisionTree</code>, which specifies a single-tree forest using all the available features, which is equivalent to a single decision tree. As before, we first evaluate the model without $c$:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>h2o_results_no_c</span> <span>=</span> <span>evaluate_h2o_model</span><span>(</span>

    <span>target_col</span><span>=</span><span>'y'</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>H2ODecisionTree</span><span>())</span>
<span>print_auc_mean_std</span><span>(</span><span>h2o_results_no_c</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>AUC: mean 0.7326, sd 0.0075
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Without $c$, the performance is very similar to scikit-learn's. But when H2O has access to $c$, it achieves an almost-perfect AUC:</p>

<p>In 2012, Massachusetts voters overwhelmingly passed (87%!) an automotive Right to Repair ballot initiative, but in the years since, car-makers have brutally sabotaged it, prompting another ballot initiative that'll be before voters in Nov.</p>
<p><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_%22Right_to_Repair%22_Initiative,_Question_1_(2012)">https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_%22Right_to_Repair%22_Initiative,<em>Question_1</em>(2012)</a></p>
<p>The 2012 rule requires car companies to provide independent mechanics with an interface to access the diagnostic info from the car's CAN bus, but not from wireless interfaces within the car. So now the automakers just send all the good stuff wirelessly.</p>
<p>Question 1 – the Mass ballot initiative – just closes that loophole, requiring the manufacturers to provide mechanics with whatever they need to access this wireless diagnostic data.</p>
<p>Naturally, the car makers are <em>freaking out</em>.</p>
<p>They've launched an absolutely <em>bugfuck</em> attack ad that says that if cars are designed to let independent mechanics fix them, stalkers will buy used cars, extract potential victims' data from them, and <em>murder them</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qj4ayw/auto-industry-tv-ads-claim-right-to-repair-benefits-sexual-predators">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qj4ayw/auto-industry-tv-ads-claim-right-to-repair-benefits-sexual-predators</a></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/noon1animation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>The ads are paid for by "The Coalition for Safe and Secure Data," a front for "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation" a front for (who else?) the car manufacturers.</p>
<p>But when this is pointed out to them, they say, "Oh yeah! Well, *guess who is paying for question one?! It is the Auto Care Association! Dunh dunh duuuuuuuhn!"</p>
<p>You will not be amazed to learn that the Auto Care Assoc represents independent mechanics.</p>
<p>Dunh dunh duuuuuhn.</p>
<p>For his excellent Motherboard story on the ads, Matthew Gault points out that you should <em>really</em> reset your car's onboard systems before you sell it or give it away.</p>
<p>He quotes Paul F Roberts from Secure Repairs who makes the even better point that if your car has a bunch of data that's useful to stalkers, it's only because the car manufacturers have turned cars into rolling surveillance platforms that spy on their drivers <em>constantly</em>.</p>
<p>Which is a pretty good point.</p>
<p>If Big Car is worried that used vehicles are full of nonconsensually collected kompromat, maybe they could, you know, just stop collecting all that data?</p>

<p>Here's your heartbreaking algorithmic cruelty story of the week: UC Riverside history prof Dana Simmons has a son who's just started junior high and loves his history teacher:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DanaJSimmons/status/1300997133311508480">https://twitter.com/DanaJSimmons/status/1300997133311508480</a></p>
<p>But when he submitted his first assignment, he was aghast to receive a 50% grade on it.</p>
<p>The assignment was graded by Edgenuity, a machine learning grift that purports to generate grades for overworked, beleagured teachers.</p>
<p>Simmons calls it an "automatic grading algorithm that values only rote repetition," and to prove the point, she told her son how to please the machine: long sentences with a lot of proper names.</p>
<p>It worked: now her son submits "word salads" consisting of two sentences (long ones, presumably) and a bunch of keywords from the lesson, and is consistently earning 100% grades. As Simmons says, "He went from an F to an A+ without learning a thing."</p>
<p>In Cathy O'Neil's seminal "Weapons of Math Destruction," she doesn't just provide a devastating critique of the underlying statistical basis for machine learning, but also a set of VERY useful rules of thumb for spotting AI grifters.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/09/06/weapons-of-math-destruction-i.html">https://boingboing.net/2016/09/06/weapons-of-math-destruction-i.html</a></p>
<p>First: if a company provides an AI but doesn't check its predictions, they don't give a shit about its accuracy.</p>
<p>Think about it: if Amazon uses ML to predict whether moving the <em>buy</em> button will generate more sales, the <em>definitely</em> measure whether sales improved after moving it.</p>
<p>The fact that this automated grading system produces estimates that are so easily gamed tells you it is a straight-up grift. I mean, the Bayesian spam filters of the mid-2000s were able to detect the "word salad" attack.</p>
<p>This isn't one of those subtle, amazing "adversarial example" attacks on a ML model – like that weird thing where a vision system is tricked into thinking that a rifle is a helicopter:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/researcher-fooled-a-google-ai-into-thinking-a-rifle-was-a-helicopter/">https://www.wired.com/story/researcher-fooled-a-google-ai-into-thinking-a-rifle-was-a-helicopter/</a></p>
<p>It's more like a password prompt that you can bypass just by hitting the spacebar a bunch of times.</p>
<p>That is: negligent garbage serving no pedagogical purpose, an embodiment of the enterprise software pathology where the person who buys the product doesn't have to use it.</p>
<p>Simmons is admirably compassionate about the whole affair: "teaching online is overwhelming and you can't do it all. <em>Please</em>, use the algorithm to track their learning. But don't post to them as if it's a measure of their performance. It's more destructive than you know."</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>School boards shouldn't be buying this tool for teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers shouldn't be using it to assess students.</p>
<p>Students should not be made to see those assessments.</p>

<p>It's been 7 years since Edward Snowden revealed the full scope of the NSA's mass surveillance program, something only hinted at by Mark Klein's 2006 whistleblowing over AT&amp;T;'s role in illegal domestic surveillance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/">https://www.wired.com/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/</a></p>
<p>In the years since, the NSA and its apologists have spun their lawless conduct in two ways: first, the insisted that domestic surveillance had foiled innumerable domestic terror plots, and second, that it was all legal.</p>
<p>The question of whether surveillance catches terrorists has an unambiguous, empirical answer: it does not. In all the years that the NSA spied on every single American, they caught one criminal: someone making a small-dollar donation to Al Shabab.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/us/politics/nsa-phone-program.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/us/politics/nsa-phone-program.html</a></p>
<p>But the legal question was thornier: the NSA's legal experts advanced theories to explain why what they did was legal under the (admittedly farcically broad) Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and why FISA was legal under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Most people who understood both FISA and the Constitution disagreed, but it was up to a court to decide. And now it has. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that NSA surveillance was illegal under both FISA <em>and</em> the Constitution.</p>
<p><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUKKBN25T3D2?il=0">https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUKKBN25T3D2?il=0</a></p>
<p>This absolutely vindicates Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia. Snowden has promised to return to the US and stand trial, on condition that it be held in open court with a jury.</p>
<p>Trump, meanwhile, has mooted pardoning him in what is almost certainly an irrelevant distraction tactic (this is true of nearly everything Trump muses about aloud).</p>
<p>What Snowden did was heroic, and his personal account of why he did it should be required reading for everyone involved in tech, security and surveillance:</p>

<p>Few people have been on the right side of more health-care issues than Atul Gawande, who is the master of simple, commonplace interventions that make gigantic differences in outcomes – like consistently using surgical checklists:</p>

<p>And because reality has a well-known bias in favor of universal health-care, it's not surprising that he's led the research on the cost- and health-effectiveness of offering care to all, free at the point of consumption:</p>

<p>What's more, these tests can be combined in ways that effectively tame the disease and would allow a quick return to something like normalcy – as they did in the Italian city of Vò, which reduced infections from 3% to 0.3% in <em>two weeks</em> with a test-and-isolate system.</p>
<p>That's the good news. The bad news is that the US's longstanding, lethal health-care dysfunction is the major impediment to getting America back on its feet.</p>

<p>In this 2-part blog series, we demonstrate how to accelerate NLP deep learning model training across multiple GPUs, taking BERT for SQuAD<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> model training time down from nearly <strong>7 hours</strong> to only <strong>30 minutes</strong>!</p>
<p>In this post, we motivate the need for deep learning and distributed training in NLP, highlight the factors that matter most for effective distributed training, and provide empirical results from a series of BERT fine-tuning experiments run in <a href="https://determined.ai/product">Determined</a>. In part 2, we’ll outline techniques for optimizing distributed data loading and model evaluation for the same NLP task.</p>

<h3 id="the-seeds-of-deep-learning-for-nlp">The Seeds of Deep Learning for NLP</h3>
<p>Neural language models like BERT, XLNet, and GPT-3 picked up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/artificial-intelligence-aristo-passed-test.html">headline-grabbing</a> steam over the last couple of years. Why is this?</p>
<p>The machine learning algorithms for common NLP tasks like entity recognition and question answering typically require feature vectors as input. Natural language inputs are represented as vectors, and from this point we train models to classify text, cluster documents, answer questions, and the like.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A considerable amount of research over the past decade has demonstrated the importance of language modeling as a driver for the ultimate quality of the downstream NLP task models.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The statistical language models of last century like <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-bag-of-words-model-b88fc4f4971">bag-of-words</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a> effectively capped the state of the art well below “earth-shattering” for many NLP tasks, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete">AI-hard</a> NLP tasks that captivate us. I remember first playing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_Fish_(website)#History">Babel Fish</a> machine translation engine in the late 1990s and concluding that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a> was a long way away — Babel Fish often felt more like a word-by-word dictionary lookup engine than a language understanding and translation AI.</p>
<p>The aforementioned cap has since lifted (arguably disappeared) for many NLP tasks, and we constantly experience the benefits firsthand when we search the web or talk to Alexa. NLP advancements exploded in 2018 as a new class of language models arrived: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMo</a> based on LSTMs, followed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> based on the transformer architecture.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> The New Idea of these language models is in their dependency on word context; whereas previous non-contextual word embeddings like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf">word2vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> encode a given word into exactly one vector, the Sesame Street models are designed to capture language nuance in ways that non-contextual word embeddings can’t by definition. (Can you spot an example in this sentence that would be problematic for word2vec, or are you seeing spots?)</p>
<h3 id="neural-language-model-training-cost">Neural Language Model Training Cost</h3>
<p>State-of-the-art language models can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08900.pdf">astronomically expensive</a> to train. Models like BERT and XLNet learn 100s of millions of parameters and the compute cost to train many neural language models from scratch is prohibitive for most organizations. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237">XLNet</a> required training for 5.5 days on 512 TPU v3’s. The cost to replicate this on GCP would be over $500,000.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Language model complexity and training cost is only increasing — OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, introduced in May 2020, learns 175 billion parameters and is estimated to have cost <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/01/ai-machine-learning-openai-gpt-3-size-isnt-everything/">over $12M to train</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/nlp_transfer_learning.png" alt="Transfer Learning in NLP"></p>
<center>An example sequential transfer learning workflow for NLP. Often costly pretraining produces a generally useful language model that is adapted to solve a specific downstream NLP task. Source for model images:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding</a></center>
<p>Thanks to the research community and the organizations backing language model research, high-quality pretrained models are freely available for anyone to use.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Not only are model checkpoints available, but the broader ML library ecosystem makes it straightforward to use these pretrained models in your framework of choice with just a few lines of code. As a result, the aforementioned sequential transfer learning approach to NLP tasks is easy to implement <em>on a reasonable budget</em>. In our case, we trained BERT for SQuAD to produce a model that can extract answers to questions about a given passage. Each experiment required under $20 of compute cost to train on GCP, <em>and</em> we achieve high quality F1 scores in the 87-89% range. For comparison’s sake, human performance is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05250.pdf">86.8%</a>, and state of the art is <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/">93%</a>.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="baseline-single-gpu-training">Baseline Single GPU Training</h3>
<p>Let’s start by training a BERT model for SQuAD on a single GPU. In <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/examples/experimental/trial/bert_squad_pytorch">this PyTorch example</a>, we use Hugging Face’s <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#run_squadpy-fine-tuning-on-squad-for-question-answering">Transformers</a> library’s pretrained model, featurization and data loading methods, and reference hyperparameters. Training for about 2 epochs on a single GPU yields an F1 score of 88.4% on the validation dataset. Not bad at all… but it took well over 7 hours to train! That’s a <em>long</em> time to wait for results, and this is only one well-trodden benchmark NLP task with fixed hyperparameters. If you or your team need to train on more data, tune hyperparameters, train models for other NLP tasks, or develop and debug models for custom downstream tasks, spending a day or longer to train each model would grind progress to a crawl.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-and-conquering">Dividing and Conquering</h3>
<p>In the remainder of this post, we show how to use <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/distributed-training.html">Determined’s distributed training features</a> to perform the same training task about <strong>14 times faster</strong>, while achieving the same model accuracy! In the process, we’ll surface the key factors affecting scaling performance and offer practical guidance for effective distributed training.</p>
<p>Thanks to Determined’s <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/standardized-models-with-determined/">standardized model paradigm</a>, <em>training a model on multiple GPUs requires no code changes</em>. Every result that follows, whether training with 2 GPUs on a single machine or 16 GPUs across multiple machines, only required a configuration change.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can train the same model above in a lunch break rather than a full workday, by utilizing distributed training on Determined. In this blog, we focus on optimizing the training loop. In part 2, we will focus on other components of the training workflow that impact overall runtime, namely data loading and validation. To that end, the following wall clock times are net of data loading and validation.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="initial-results">Initial Results</h3>
<p>The following graph and table show wall clock training time as we scale from 1 to 8 NVIDIA K80 GPUs,<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> all on a single machine on GCP. For these experiments, we fixed both the per-GPU batch size and the total number of epochs to train.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/dtrain_graph.png" alt="Training Time vs. GPUs"></p>
<center></center>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th># GPUs</th>
<th>Training Time (minutes)</th>
<th>Per-GPU Scaling Efficiency</th>

<td>118</td>
<td>0.85</td>

<tr>

<td>61</td>
<td>0.82</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a decent initial result — we aren’t achieving linear scaling, but our scaling efficiency remains above 80%, and also we managed to get wall clock training time for the BERT SQuAD model down to an hour. We achieved an F1 score of 87-88% on the validation dataset for all four experiments.</p>
<h3 id="doing-better-gradient-aggregation-and-radam">Doing Better: Gradient Aggregation and RAdam</h3>
<p>In our results above, there is a clear downward trend in scaling efficiency as we increase the degree of training parallelism. What’s going on there? Maybe we can live with the results at this scale, but what if we had a much heavier-weight training workload that we wanted to distribute across 64 GPUs? The trend is not playing in our favor.</p>
<p>A natural theory for what might be happening is that training is communication-bound. To distribute training over 8 GPUs, Determined divides the training dataset into 8 shards, independently trains 8 models (one per GPU) for a minibatch, and then aggregates and communicates gradient updates so that all 8 copies of the model have the same weights. Then we repeat this process of forward &amp; backward pass followed by gradient aggregation, for every batch.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> As we discuss in our blog <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/distributed-deep-learning-that-actually-works/">here</a> and in our product documentation <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/topic-guides/effective-distributed-training.html#effective-distributed-training">here</a>, communication-reducing techniques like large batch training can help to reduce wall clock training time. Such techniques are particularly promising when GPUs are connected via PCI-E as opposed to higher-bandwidth (yet more expensive) NVLink.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Let’s see if this theory plays out for our model. With Determined, you can adjust your per-slot batch size with a configuration change, though bear in mind that even small increases can quickly exhaust GPU memory because the intermediate state needed for the forward and backward pass scale with the size of the model and are <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-break-gpu-memory-boundaries-even-with-large-batch-sizes-7a9c27a400ce">linearly dependent</a> on the batch size. Instead, we kept GPU memory requirements moderate in order to run on lower cost NVIDIA K80s. We accomplished this by leveraging a Determined distributed training optimization that reduces both inter-GPU communication and per-GPU memory requirements. This <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/reference/experiment-config.html#optimizations">aggregation frequency</a> configuration option specifies the number of forward and backward passes to perform before communicating gradient updates across GPUs. In the following table, we see that increasing our aggregation frequency definitely helps runtime:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aggregation Frequency</th>
<th>Wall Clock Time Savings (minutes)</th>
<th>Validation F1</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>87.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>85</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>31</td>
<td>52.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That’s great — if we can cut 31 minutes off of training time, our per-GPU scaling efficiency goes from 0.93 to a perfect 1. I left something out though — for the 3 rows above, our validation dataset F1 scores are 87.3%, 85%, and (gulp) 52.1%, respectively.</p>
<p>So close, and yet so far. What is happening here? Large batch stochastic gradient descent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf">doesn’t always “just work”</a>; in particular, it’s difficult to find the learning rate sweet spot in this setting. Sometimes, the Linear Scaling Rule works, where if we multiple the batch size by <em>k</em>, we also multiply the (previously tuned) learning rate by <em>k</em>. In our case, using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/optimizer_schedules.html#adamw-pytorch">AdamW</a> optimizer, linear scaling did not help at all; in fact, our F1 scores were even worse when applying the Linear Scaling Rule. Learning rate warmup strategies can also help, where smaller learning rates are used early in large-batch training. In our experience, though, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265v1">RAdam</a> optimizer is a better bet that performs robustly for large batch training without the need for extensive learning rate tuning. When we swap in <a href="https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/RAdam/tree/master/radam">this RAdam implementation</a>, our results look much better:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aggregation Frequency</th>
<th>Wall Clock Time Savings (minutes)</th>
<th>Validation F1</th>

<td>10</td>
<td>19</td>

<td>21</td>
<td>83.8</td>

<p>In this case, we can see that even a fairly aggressive …</p></div></div></section></div>

		<p>You probably know me. Or someone like me. The guy who always raises his hand in class or who has a question or comment regarding whatever idea is being discussed. You might find people like me annoying. I’ve never understood why there seems to be so few of us though. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve wanted to question things; to figure out <em>why</em> or <em>how</em>. Unfortunately, it seems most people don’t. Or rather, it seems as though people are afraid of asking questions. Whether it is from fear of showing that they don’t know or from not wanting to take up other people’s time or something else entirely, I’ve never been able to understand. I do know, however, that it disturbs me.</p>

<p>There are many quotes on questions, like “better to ask and be thought a fool for five minutes than to remain a fool forever” and the likes, but to me, there is something deeper than that. Asking questions often reveals a lot more information than just the answer to the question, almost regardless of the situation. At university, questions can not only reveal errors in the material, but they can spawn discussions on aspects of the topic that suddenly makes it so much clearer why things have to be the way they are. If you strive to understand, questions tend to give a deeper understanding of what’s going on than trying to fill the gaps yourself.</p>

<p>Questions are important in the professional world as well, whether to make clients think properly through the problem they are presenting you with so you don’t go solving the wrong problem or to your peers to come up with the best solution to a problem. I’ve lost count of the number of times a solution has been accepted simply because no-one asked questions at the time it was proposed, only for it to later turn out that it was a terrible solution, and several people in the group saw that it was. This is not because the person with the original idea was an idiot, but rather because there was no feedback process. Without questions, without questioning, ideas are never refined. They need critique and thought, things that are incurred by asking questions.</p>

<p>Indeed, even in personal relationships, questions are important. Asking others questions about themselves serves both to show them that you care, but also for you to learn more about that person. And not only whatever the answer to the question is; you often learn a great deal more about a person simply from digging a little bit. One question often turns into a deeper conversation. Even asking others questions about yourself can be hugely rewarding; what better way of getting a better understanding of how people perceive you than to ask? Many might find this difficult because they are afraid of what they might learn, but if you truly want to improve yourself as a person, then asking is the best way of finding out where you should start.</p>

<p>So, given all the benefits asking questions have, why are there so few people like me? Why is it that there’s “that one person always raising his hand” or that “that one person always questioning people’s ideas”? Why is it that during lectures, I’m the only one who asks questions nearly every time? Why is it that such a low fraction of people account for such a large fraction of the questions? I refuse to believe that other people aren’t curious or have doubts about things. My deepest fear is that people just don’t care. That they don’t care how a particular project turns out or whether they get a complete understanding of whatever is being taught in a lecture. They just want to get by. This is a terrible, terrible attitude, one that inhibits innovation and exploration. Come on people, raise your hands and speak your mind! Develop. Learn. Explore. Question. Care! Or go do something else.</p>

<p>(back-ported from Medium - May 19, 2019)</p>

<p>I used to get rather upset about how I was born so late into the game of computer science. I mean look at it, all the coolest stuff that involves computer science fundamentals we learned in school have all been invented — programming languages, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, storage systems, cryptography, computer graphics, world wide web, etc. Our day-to-day job involves taking these wonderful tools built by other brilliant people and then stitching them together with if/else statements. Everything is becoming a blackbox and these boxes just keep on getting bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>binaries → high level languages &amp; frameworks</li>
<li>formal proof → chaos monkey</li>
<li>on-prem → cloud</li>
<li>decision trees → neural networks</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of how high the piles of abstraction are, there is simply no way to understand everything. So we have no choice but to use the lazy evaluation approach — where we trust the systems and tools to work, and only when it doesn’t will we then start digging into the layers of abstraction in an attempt to understand and fix the problem. If we are lucky, we can dig all the way to the root of the problem. Other times it is a true blackbox (be it due to a mental constraint, like neural networks, where our brain simply doesn’t have that kind of capability to process all the information; or be it due to a physical constraint, like cloud products, where the source code is locked away as trade secrets), where all we could do is trial and error — we form an arbitrary hypothesis, run it against the box, and check its output to see if matches the hypothesis. And perhaps with this newly concluded confirmation bias we fixed the problem, but we still don’t fully understand the box so we are left with a hint of sadness. Theoretically we could build everything from scratch, but working in the industry means productivity is king; we certainly won’t be at our jobs for long if we insisted on doing that.</p>

<p>It took my ego a while to accept this reality. But once I did, I realized: how close-minded of me to think that all the coolest things have been invented! The point of invention is that it does not exist yet. So that assumption all the coolest things have been invented is absurd (and cocky). Instead, the area for innovations simply moved up in the abstraction layer, while I grudgingly stayed below. I learned to marvel at the existing robustness and intricacy of the systems and tools we already have, and at the same time try to take learnings from it in attempt to identify gaps and improve the ecosystem further.</p>

<p>Thinking on a higher level today, there are so many potential areas for improvements off the top of my head (from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer, so these ideas are rather limited in scope):</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are the most popular programming languages still designed for a single machine and have to rely on libraries built on top of application protocols to communicate between machines? I could imagine a rise of distributed + declarative programming languages in the near future that abstract all that away.</li>
<li>Why are we still stuck on application protocols like HTTP/FTP/etc. anyways? I could imagine higher level of protocols that communicate more with less code/data.</li>
<li>Why are we replicating data on so many heterogenous storage systems in order to optimize for different use patterns. I can imagine a one-size-fits-many database in the future which stores the data once but leverage machine learning to optimize for different usage patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I have come to accept my fate as a millennial software engineer that stands on the shoulder of giants and stitches their work together, because I realized that the giants before us were no different — they were also building abstraction layers on top of the work known before them. There is always room for innovation, as long as one sets the mind to it. This is what I love about this field of work — formulating ideas and then making them concrete via code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d like to announce the public beta of <a href="https://www.cerveau.app/">Cerveau</a><sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, a web app for managing plain-text notes from a GitHub repository. Cerveau integrates directly with <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> which supports <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten</a>-style note-taking in Markdown. This very site you are reading is managed by Neuron and edited in Cerveau, and its Git repo is essentially <a href="https://github.com/srid/srid.ca">a directory of Markdown files</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.cerveau.app/"><img src="https://www.srid.ca/static/cerveau.svg"></a></p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I created the open-source <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_one%27s_own_itch">scratch my own itch</a>, wherein I wanted to maintain my notes for a lifetime, without being dependent on proprietory formats or systems. I still wasn’t totally satisfied however, because I did not want to give up on the <em>convenience</em> of managing notes from a web app on my mobile phone. I didn’t want to be tied to a desktop text editor. So, the idea behind Cerveau was born - which began to resolve that dissatifaction without compromising on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html">future-proofness</a>.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>All notes are written in Markdown, and stored in a Git repository. Cerveau directly modifies the contents of the repository using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps">GitHub Apps API</a>, while caching the latest revision of the repository on a PostgreSQL database. This allows me to edit my notes from a web browser (as well as from a mobile phone), while keeping the canonical version always on Git all the while allowing edits from elsewhere such as <a href="https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode#neuron-mode">Emacs</a> (i.e., two-way sync).</p><h2 id="technology-used">Technology used</h2><p>Both the backend and frontend components of Cerveau are written in <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2009703.html">Haskell</a></span></span>. Haskell is my programming language of choice, because it gets a lot of things right (see <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_matters">Why Haskell matters</a>). Software I write in Haskell tends to be reliable; and I can refactor with confidence without being unduly afraid of introducing bugs. This is especially important when dealing with otherwise brittle JavaScript code in frontend code.</p><h3 id="javascript-is-the-new-assembly-language">JavaScript is the new assembly language</h3><p>Cerveau’s frontend too is written in Haskell. Wait, how is that possible? The GHCJS compiler compiles Haskell code to low-level JavaScript for running in the browser. Cerveau uses the <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012405.html">Reflex FRP</a></span></span> library, via the excellent <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012403.html">Obelisk</a></span></span> framework, which takes care of all the plumbing required to produce such full-stack Haskell apps, so that I as a developer can focus on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/31rat9/reflex_practical_functional_reactive_programming/">FRP</a> application logic. FRP, and similar models of UI programming, is simpler to write and extend than callback based code. Anybody who writes Elm<sup><a href="#fn2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup> can attest to that; however unlike Elm or PureScript, GHCJS code can be <em>shared</em> with the backend. This is what enables Cerveau to directly reuse much of the <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> source code, thus enabling neuron’s core features to work directly on the browser–for example, live HTML preview while editing the note.</p><p>The editor widget is based on CodeMirror, via <a href="https://github.com/Atidot/reflex-codemirror">reflex-codemirror</a>.</p><h3 id="real-time-communication-via-websockets">Real-time communication via WebSockets</h3><p>WebSockets, via <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012401.html">Rhyolite</a></span></span>, is used for real-time communication between the backend and the frontend; if you have two windows open, then updating a note from one window will have the other window automatically update its view without an explicit refresh (this works even if you are viewing a different note that has the modified note in its backlinks).</p><h3 id="nix">Nix</h3><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017102.html">Nix</a></span></span> is used for both developent and deployment; the production version in particular is deployed to a <a href="https://m.do.co/c/d19bbb4d33e8">DigitalOcean</a> droplet running <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/c7170724.html">NixOS</a></span></span>. Nix makes reproducible development environments easy and possible. A testament to this is how easy it is to contribute to neuron (see <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>) - as with one command, <code>nix-shell</code>, you get the full development enviornment including Haskell IDE support starting from a pristine system with nothing but Nix installed.</p><h3 id="full-stack-haskell-from-prototype-to-production">Full-Stack Haskell, from Prototype to Production</h3><p>Much of these technology choices were informed by my working with the folks from <a href="https://obsidian.systems/">Obsidian Systems</a>, whose philosophy is captured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJuXDIUMA0">this talk</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/riJuXDIUMA0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Note this is Part IV of a series on the economics of skyscrapers. The rest of the series can be read <a href="https://buildingtheskyline.org/economics-of-skyscraper-height-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br>
</em></p>
<h3><strong>Rise of the Skylines</strong></h3>
<p>As we look around planet Earth, we can’t help but notice that skyscrapers are getting taller. In 2000, for example, the average height of the tallest 100 completed buildings was around 285 meters (935 feet). In 2018, that number was about 385 meters (1263 feet), for an average annual growth rate of 1.8%. What is causing this rise in building height?</p>
<h4><strong>The Demand for Height</strong></h4>
<p>First and foremost, skyscraper construction is <a href="http://buildingtheskyline.org/skyscraper-height-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demand driven</a>. Tall buildings are built to satisfy our need and desire to be together in dense urban areas. The more humans base their economies on services and <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/sls/ipmsls/v34y20187.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intangible products</a>, they more they are drawn to cities. The masters of finance, marketing, business services, and high-tech need to <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jeclit/v51y2013i3p825-37.html">cluster together</a> in order to make their products. Also, the great wealth generated by this productivity fuels the growth of the consumer-oriented city, and its concomitant suite of cultural and entertainment-based amenities. The quest for a better life draws people to the same place at the same time. The skyscraper is thus a solution to the problem—it is a machine that converts air to land.</p>
<h4><strong>The Supply of Height</strong></h4>
<p>But here I want to argue that to really understand skyscraper heights, we need to investigate not only the demand for tall buildings, but also the forces that create their supply. If we want to understand building patterns around the world in places like China or the United Arab Emirates, we need to study the costs of construction in these places. The rise of skylines in Asia is as much as due to the cost side as it is to urbanization and the increasing importance of global cities.</p>

<h3><strong>The Economic Theory of Skyscraper Height</strong></h3>
<p>But, before we dive more deeply into the costs of building a shiny new skyscraper, we first pause to discuss the economic theory of skyscraper height. The <a href="http://buildingtheskyline.org/skyscraper-height-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>economic height</em></a> of a structure is the one that makes the most sense in terms of best balancing the demand for height with the costs of providing it. If we did some economic modeling, what pops out is an equation for the optimal building height (based on some simplifying assumptions). Though one can find a more detailed treatment <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jrefec/v45y2012i3p723-753.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, the bottom line is that this equation can be given in a simplified form:</p>
<p><em>Economic Height = (Market Price Per Floor)/(Construction Costs Index Value)</em></p>
<p>Or for simplicity:</p>
<p><em>H=P/C.</em></p>
<p>That is, the economic height is given by the market price per floor, <em>P,</em> relative to a measure of construction costs, <em>C</em>, which includes the prices of materials and labor, and the efficiency of the construction operation.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> We can observe from the equation that, all else equal, the lower the value of <em>C</em>, the taller a building will be in a given city at a given time.</p>
<h3><strong>P</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to understand the near-universal pattern of why there are tall buildings in the city center and low-rise building further away, then just look at the nature of the market prices per floor (or per square foot or meter), and you will see they drop off rather steeply as one moves further away from the center. That is to say, within a city, at a given time, we can assume that <em>C</em> is about the same for all builders. It’s <em>P</em> then that measures what building occupants are willing to pay at various locations.</p>
<p>And <em>P</em> can be broken down into, roughly speaking, two parts. Part I is the quality of what’s inside the building (does it have fast elevators, great views, marble floors, etc.?). Part II is the quality of what’s outside the building—its location. This is the key reason why buildings are so tall at the center—the location (or land) value is so high. Wall Street firms need to <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/3362.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cluster together</a> to earn greater profits and they pay for the right to do it. Developers respond to the high willingness to pay by going taller. The desire to pay falls rapidly as one moves away from the center. This has been strongly documented <a href="http://buildingtheskyline.org/book-review-order-without-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around the world</a> and <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/2378_1718_Land_Values_in_Chicago_1913-2010_0414LL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over time</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2497"><img src="http://buildingtheskyline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chicago-land-values-640x419.png" alt="" width="700" height="458" srcset="https://buildingtheskyline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chicago-land-values-640x419.png 640w, https://buildingtheskyline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chicago-land-values-300x196.png 300w, https://buildingtheskyline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chicago-land-values-768x502.png 768w, https://buildingtheskyline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chicago-land-values-1024x670.png 1024w, https://buildingtheskyline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chicago-land-values.png 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2497">3D Visualizations of Land Values in Chicago.

<h3><strong>A Moving Target</strong></h3>
<p>Skyscraper height is thus determined by the ratio of the benefits to the costs. If we want to understand height at a given time in a given city, then using the prices at various locations is a decent indicator of about how tall a building should be. But if we want to compare this economic height over time and/or across cities then things get more complicated—both <em>P</em> and <em>C</em> become moving targets.</p>
<p>Compare New York to Shanghai, for example. The average height of the two cities’ completed skyscrapers since 1988 have been similar. But the question we cannot decipher is what are the relative prices to costs? In New York, both prices and costs are higher than in Shanghai; and yet the ratio is about the same. Asking rents in the new 67-story One Vanderbilt tower adjacent to Grand Central Station are up to <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/03/four-new-leases-planned-for-superstructure-one-vanderbilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$160 per square foot</a> ($1,722 per square meter). The 128-story Shanghai Tower, evidently, has <a href="https://www.dichandadang.com/en/office-leasing/shanghai/pudong/shanghai-tower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asking rents of half that</a> amount (and now you get a sense of the relative costs of building in these two cities that generates the same average heights).</p>
<h4>Roaring Twenties</h4>
<p>This equation can also help us understand the building boom in New York during the <a href="http://buildingtheskyline.org/roaring-twenties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roaring Twenties</a>. <em>P</em> was rising because of the growing economy, and <em>C</em> was falling due to technological innovations and learning-by-doing. When you put the two things together you can a rapid rise in the heights of buildings.</p>

Here a skyscraper is a building of at least 150 meters. Source: <a href="https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Skyscraper Center, CTBUH</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>Global Costs</strong></h3>
<p>One of the key drivers of costs around the world are wages. An unskilled construction worker in New York, for example, is paid <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes472061.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$17.57 per hour</a>. In India, laborers get paid <a href="http://qz.com/148688/hong-kongs-labor-shortage-means-140-per-day-construction-workers-waiters-with-great-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$0.63 dollars per hour</a>. While the same type of workers in China receive <a href="http://news.sohu.com/20130619/n379288036.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about $3.36 dollar per hour</a>. Since labor costs represent a substantial fraction of total costs (in the U.S. they can be as high as half the costs), the less developers must pay for labor, the lower the costs, and thus the more likely they are to build taller.</p>
<p>Consider some examples (in non-inflation adjusted U.S. dollars). One World Trade Center cost nearly $4 billion, as compared to the Shanghai Tower, which cost $2.4 building to construct. On a per-floor basis, that’s nearly double the costs. The Burj Khalifa, is almost 300 meters taller than One World Trade Center, yet the total costs were 61% less! The idea of getting a 163-story building in New York for $1.5 billion is laughable.</p>

<h4>A Skyscraper Cost Index</h4>
<p>To investigate this issue in more detail, I created an index of skyscraper construction costs around the world. The website, Emporis.com, lists the <a href="http://www.emporis.com/statistics/most-expensive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costs of 200 large high-rise buildings</a>. (Details about how I created the index can be found <a href="https://store.ctbuh.org/research-reports/139-economic-drivers-skyscrapers-in-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). It is, admittedly, a first attempt to measure skyscraper construction costs. A more detailed analysis is made difficult by the fact that developers (or their general contractors) generally do not release the cost of construction and so I need to use the limited publicly available data.</p>
<p>But what the exercise shows is that, relative to the U.S., mainland China and the Arabian countries can get skyscrapers for a substantial discount relative to the United States (and even more so compared to New York City).</p>

<h3><strong>Costnomics</strong></h3>
<p>But an index value doesn’t tell how total costs change with building heights, it only gives a measure of the average costs of construction. To better understand the economics of building height, we need to dive a little deeper. Let’s take the point of view of a developer. Say we own a large lot in an office district in downtown Barropolis. We know (approximately) the average rents we can expect to earn once the building is filled, since we can observe the rents being paid in similar towers. This means that in order to maximize the profit, we need to determine how our total costs change as we go higher, in order to find the sweet spot.</p>
<p>It’s generally believed that average costs per square foot or meter are u-shaped with respect to floor height. For smaller buildings, going taller means that the per floor costs are falling, and then, at some height, they begin to rise. At that point, the costs of providing an additional floor becomes greater. For example, the cost of adding the 51<sup>st</sup> floor is more than the cost of adding the 41<sup>st</sup> floor. Where that turning point is remains an open question, and, as I will show below, it seems to be different in different cities.</p>
<p>The economic theory of skyscrapers says that the profit maximizing developer keeps adding floors until the revenue of the last floor just equals the cost of providing it. One floor less means leaving money on the table since the revenue from another floor will be greater than the cost. Building one floor above the profit maximizing height means losing money since the cost of the last floor was greater than the revenue is generates.</p>
<h4><strong>More Concrete</strong></h4>
<p>So why do the costs of adding more and more floors rise after some point?&nbsp; The answer has to do with the nature of building tall. Going taller and taller requires thicker materials, such as concrete or steel, on the lower floors to support the superstructure (as do the internal elements such as plumbing and electricity). Similarly, the cost of the foundation rises as the building gets taller because the it needs to support more weight.</p>
<h4>Swaying in the Wind</h4>
<p>Next is the additional costs of wind bracing. Tall buildings are constantly being bombarded by the wind. The …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

                    <p>Machine Learning can be used to increase Collections and Recoveries. Case study done in this article describes a machine learning model developed in R to enhance debt collection process for lending companies in financial sector. The model implemented in this case study enhances an existing recovery system by creating focus groups for business to boost debt collection.</p><blockquote><em><u>Disclaimer:</u> This case study is solely an educational exercise and information contained in this case study is to be used only as a case study example for teaching purposes. This hypothetical case study is provided for illustrative purposes only and do not represent an actual client or an actual client’s experience. All of the data, contents and information presented here have been altered and edited to protect the confidentiality and privacy of the company.</em></blockquote><p>Given the economic situation and with the increasing competition in the lending business and services sector, collection functions of all the companies across the financial business spectrum are feeling pressure. The traditional characteristics of debtors across the industries are no longer appropriate. The tools and techniques previously used are far out of date. </p><p>The economic changes in recent years have had a key impact on the debt collection functions of the Businesses. it is much more difficult now to differentiate between customers who have simply fallen behind in their payments and customers who plan on staying behind. Furthermore, businesses are increasingly interested in how big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to increase revenue, lower costs, and improve their business processes. It is time for the collection teams to embrace the future and adopt new models not only to cut cost but also to become agile in adapting the changes.</p><p>We reassessed the traditional recovery system and came up with an <strong>AI based enhancement</strong> to the traditional system that can significantly improve the performance of recoveries. </p><h3 id="1-understanding-recovery-system">1. &nbsp;Understanding Recovery System</h3><p>Those who are familiar with the finance lending business or credit business understands that as long as customer pays the due balance it remains normal to the crediting company. Upon failure of making the payment, customer's account becomes default. At this point delinquency begins which leads to collection and recovery. Given below describes different phases (in sequence) of customers in delinquency and recovery.</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/07/image.png"></figure><ul><li><strong>Delinquency:</strong> An account goes to Delinquency when a payment of minimum due is not made by customer upon reaching overdue date.</li><li><strong>Collection:</strong> An account goes to Collection when a payment is not made by customer for three statement in a row. </li><li><strong>Recovery:</strong> An account is marked for Recovery when it reaches six months of non payment. </li></ul><p>If we look at the traditional debit collection process there are three entities/players involved in debt collection process other than customer himself as given below:</p><ul><li><strong>Crediting Company:</strong> It is the main crediting company. Once a recovery case is created, it is assigned to one of the collection agents of the crediting company. This assignment is done by Collection Manager based on his experience with the team and performance of collection agent.</li><li><strong>Collection Agency:</strong> A collection agency is a third party that is hired by the crediting company to collect the debt on their behalf. Collection agencies usually get paid with a percentage of the money they recover or a flat fee.</li><li><strong>Lawyer:</strong> Lawyers might become involved in the recovery process at any time, even before a lawsuit starts. Some collection law firms are basically collection agencies, with large collection departments. The lawyers at these firms might not actually have any direct involvement with your debt. Once a lawsuit to collect the credit card debt against you begins, though, a lawyer will definitely be involved, though perhaps minimally. (Lawyers trying to collect large volumes of credit card debt from different debtors usually spend little time on each individual suit.)</li></ul><h3 id="2-goals-and-objectives">2. &nbsp;Goals and Objectives</h3><p>For this case study, objectives are to see how crediting companies can benefit from Artificial Intelligence and to see how this new AI based methodology can be used to increase revenue, lower costs, and improve their business processes. Given below are the key objectives of the project.</p><ul><li><strong>Optimum Cost:</strong> Labour costs are the single biggest expense that recovery department face. This new AI based enhancement will identify focus groups for a more effective debt collection strategy to help reduce costs, save time and maximize resources. </li><li><strong>Improved Collector Efficiency:</strong> This machine learning model will improve agents efficiency by creating focus groups. This will not only increase promise to pay rate but also suggest best suitable agent to the case. This will be done using historical data and agent’s best performing markets and category of cases resolved.</li><li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Recovery prioritization and strategy is a key to increase revenue. The machine learning algorithms in this model will improve collection efforts and increase recovery amount by identifying customers with the highest and quick payment probability. This re-prioritization of customers by the model can be done regularly i.e weekly or monthly. </li><li><strong>Up-to-date information at one place:</strong> While working on the case, it is difficult for a collection agent to go back and fourth into various files and systems to view updated information. This will be resolved through standardized reports. Comprehensive dashboards will be available to the agent which will contain all necessary up-to-date information (contact info, balances, additional info etc.) for the agent to start or resume working on a particular case.</li><li><strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong> Reporting dashboards will be refreshed daily for regular monitoring of debtor account since model will re-prioritize the account regularly on the basis of chances of payment. Using this dashboard collection manager will devise strategy to work the accounts and collect unpaid balance. It will also provide complete portfolio intelligence and monitoring of the ongoing collection process.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Communication:</strong> Based on the past interactions with the customers and demographics, the model will suggest the best mode of communication. For instance, in general Baby Boomers and GenX respond well to calls, while iGen and millennial generally respond better to text reminders. </li><li><strong>Interactive Dashboard for Recoveries:</strong> To provide wholistic view of recovery performance. The data produced by the model will be used in-conjunction with customer basic data to build a dashboard showing key KPIs along with comprehensive MIS to monitor the recovery process.</li></ul><h3 id="3-overview-of-the-solution">3. &nbsp;Overview of the Solution</h3><p>The proposed system can be used as an enhancement to any existing recovery system. We are naming this new enhancement as <strong>Machine Learning Boost Recoveries (MLBR). </strong>In this enhancement, Machine learning (ML) which is an advanced analytics technique and a sub field of AI will be used. &nbsp;ML teach computers to do what comes naturally to humans by learning from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to learn information directly from data. These algorithms improve their accuracy with the time as they learn from unseen data. </p><p><strong><em>Why Machine Learning is adopted instead of classical Predictive Modeling?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Machine learning</strong> is an area of computer science which uses cognitive learning methods to program systems without the need of being explicitly programmed. These machines are well known to grow better with experience. <strong>Predictive modeling</strong>, on the other hand, is a mathematical technique which combine statistics with programming to do prediction. It aims to work upon the provided information and conditions to reach an end conclusion after an event has been triggered. We used machine learning due to the complexity of the problem in hand as well as the number of variables that may get involve. We do not want to restrict predictions based on the knowledge of Subject Matter Expert (SME) or by running statistics on historical data. Instead, we want to discover hidden patterns in the data which can only be possible using machine learning techniques. Furthermore, we wanted to seek advantage of improvement in accuracy as the machine learns from experience and unseen data. </p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png"><figcaption>Overview of the MLBR system</figcaption></figure><h3 id="4-high-level-design">4. &nbsp;High Level design</h3><p>The design of the new enhancement is built by keeping in mind six key areas:</p><ul><li>Data Collection</li><li>Data Preparation</li><li>Modeling</li><li>Testing and Cross Validation</li><li>Production Deployment</li><li>Real world Evaluation</li></ul><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png"><figcaption>MLBR modeling process flow chart</figcaption></figure><p>to be continued...</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p2/">part-2</a> we will look at the Data Collection and Preparation.</p><p>Cheers :) </p>

<p><em>The time has come,’ the Walrus said,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To talk of many things:</em><br>
<em>Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cabbages — and kings —</em><br>
<em>And why the sea is boiling hot —</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whether pigs have wings.’</em></p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43914/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter-56d222cbc80a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>-The Walrus and The Carpenter</em></a></u><em>, Lewis Carroll</em></p>
<p>When asked to recall a poem or a song from childhood, I recall the above verse from<em> The Walrus and The Carpenter </em>by Lewis Carroll<em>.</em> (For the sake of understanding this piece, it may be beneficial to read or skim the full poem). These words take me straight to the <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00WCEbKM_SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scene</a></u> from <em>Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland</em> where Tweedledee and Tweedledum recount the tale of the Walrus and the Carpenter walking side by side as the little, helpless oysters, trail behind them.</p>
<p>As a child listening to the sing-songy tune of the poem’s iambic pentameter, I could not help but feel disturbed by the themes of trickery and selfishness strewn across the poem. Yet, there was no reason to address or overthink any of the negativity in the story. While this poem bears a heavy load and to the literary critic, demands to be unpacked, it is actually dripping with intentional nonsense, and maybe that’s the way it’s supposed to be.</p>
<p>The story follows two characters as they walk together on the shore on an evening where the sun and the moon are both visible. The scene from the movie, which slightly differs from the actual poem, does a better job at depicting the motives of the Walrus and the Carpenter. The Walrus, portrayed as a distinguished, heartless individual is clearly out to feast on as many baby oysters as he can. The Carpenter, although driven by a common motive, is clearly not the brains of the operation. The two plunge into the sea to coerce the oysters to join them on an “adventure.” While the baby oysters are warned by the eldest oyster not to go with the Walrus, it seems that they are unanimously taken in by the chorus of the poem:</p>
<p><em>The time has come,’ the Walrus said,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To talk of many things:</em><br>
<em>Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cabbages — and kings —</em><br>
<em>And why the sea is boiling hot —</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whether pigs have wings.’</em></p>
<p>The oysters jump to their feet and cannot help but follow the Walrus and the Carpenter for “a mile or so” down the shore. It is with great excitement and ignorance that they follow along — enchanted by the nonsense of the Walrus’ Siren Song. And suddenly, it is too late…</p>
<p><em>“O Oysters,’ said the Carpenter,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’ve had a pleasant run!</em><br>
<em>Shall we be trotting home again?’</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But answer came there none —</em><br>
<em>And this was scarcely odd, because</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They’d eaten every one.”</em></p>
<p>While some may say this poem is the very reason your mother told you not to play with your food, I find myself caught up in the nonsense of the story itself. What is the significance of the Walrus and Carpenter, and what exactly brought these two characters together? Why is the Carpenter the only human in the story? And why does he lack the morality to tell his animal counterpart that it isn’t polite to con small creators into “joining you for dinner?” And why is the most nonsensical verse of all the one that convinces the oysters to leave their warm oyster beds for an unfortunate demise? Even more so — why does the wise oyster let the young oysters go in the first place? Why didn’t he/she put up more of a fight?</p>
<p>The imagery this story provides may act as a distraction to the reader, yet <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walrus_and_the_Carpenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a></u> have tried to attribute political, religious, and nationalistic ideas to the <em>Walrus and the Carpenter</em>. In fact, Carroll seems to set up a type of mad world where everything is just a little bit upside down and backwards. These ideas are described in the poem’s earlier verses, before the two protagonists enter, stage right:</p>
<p><em>The moon was shining sulkily,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because she thought the sun</em><br>
<em>Had got no business to be there</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the day was done —</em><br>
<em>“It’s very rude of him,” she said,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To come and spoil the fun.”</em></p>
<p><em>The sea was wet as wet could be,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sands were dry as dry.</em><br>
<em>You could not see a cloud, because</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No cloud was in the sky:</em><br>
<em>No birds were flying overhead —</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no birds to fly.</em></p>
<p>The sun and the moon shine at the same time as Carroll states ironically that yes, the sea was very wet, the sands “dry as dry.” The birds are absent, perhaps because birds do not often fly at night. The clouds are absent, perhaps because there aren’t often clouds when the sun shines its brightest. Amongst these contradictory clauses, the author introduces this unlikely duo with no further introduction. Of course, the fact that they’re walking “close at hand” establishes a sense of closeness in the relationship. One does not walk close at hand with just any walrus.</p>
<p>As the young oysters leave their oyster beds and follow along, even a child reader could predict that these creatures have quickly become prey. Of course there is plenty of analyzing we can do at this point. We can speak badly of these two hunters, man and beast walking side by side, beast seemingly in control of man, as opposed to the other way around. We can summon feelings of sympathy for these young oysters, who are literally walking to their death. We can view the Walrus as a conman who, if you look at the poem, initiates his feast by once again delivering the following iconic speech to the oysters,</p>
<p><em>“The time has come,’ the Walrus said,</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To talk of many things…”</em></p>
<p>No literary critic can argue the nonsense of this stanza. At this critical moment, the reader is forced to give in to the ridiculous situation Carroll has presented. This poem epitomizes <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_nonsense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonsense literature</a></u>: a literary genre which combines elements that make sense with those that do not. By skewing the logic and natural expectation of the reader, one is left not knowing what to expect from the work.</p>
<p>We find these ideas most notably in children’s stories, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes. Children’s stories are filled with nonsense, almost definitively. We see <u><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46951/humpty-dumpty-sat-on-a-wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eggs</a></u> falling off of walls — a tisket here, a tasket <u><a href="https://allnurseryrhymes.com/a-tisket-a-tasket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there</a></u>, and three or so <u><a href="http://www.rhymes.org.uk/three_blind_mice.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blind mice</a></u>. When it comes to these stories, if it rhymes, it works. This may be the rule with the <em>Walrus and the Carpenter</em> as well.</p>
<p>In the <em>Annotated Alice</em>, coauthor Martin Gardner tells the <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walrus_and_the_Carpenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a></u> of the Carpenter’s fruition. When Lewis Carroll gave his manuscript to illustrator John Tenniel, he gave him the option of drawing either a carpenter, a butterfly, or a baronet — as each word would fit the poem’s metre. Rumor has it that it was not Carroll who chose the Carpenter, but Tenniel. Therefore any symbolic interpretations of the Carpenter are rendered null. The Carpenter offers no significance to the poem other than his three-syllable convenience. This begs the question: what else may be this way?</p>
<p>This cautions the reader not to overanalyze or look for symbolism where symbolism does not necessarily exist. Carroll claims: “The Alice books were made for the imagination of children and not for the analysis of “mad people.” This ideas seems to suggest that sometimes man is overly curious. We have a tendency to search for the deeper meaning of a text as opposed to taking it at face value. To quote Tweedledee and Tweedledum, “The oysters were curious too…”</p>
<p>Yet, as adults, we’re forced to recall these hazy tales that drip with nonsense and jest as staples of our childhoods. What can we make of this? Are we meant to shut off our overly critical minds and simply bask in the nonsense? Is it possible to enjoy a story at face value without wondering what the author was <em>really </em>trying to tell us? Perhaps this is the literary world’s way of telling us not to take life too seriously. Sometimes it’s okay to sing along to a song even if we don’t know exactly what the words mean. We must keep our curiosity at bay and find comfort where we are in the story, lest we find ourselves eaten for dinner.</p>

<p>My first job out of college offered me many interesting experiences. I had somehow found myself the first and only hardware engineer at a software startup in the Valley. The company's initial distribution strategy was installing software on POSes (Point of Sales systems) in small businesses. They quickly found that patching the product to support any and every flavor of POS operating systems out there was a real pain in the ass. Furthermore, there were some POSes gaining traction with closed ecosystems (cough Square cough), who were building their own version of our product. Not wanting to compete in such an environment, they had a brilliant idea: ship out their own hardware to merchants that have a POS that they weren't able to integrate with. Ahhh, the best-laid plans of mice and men. They began happily shipping tables en masse. With no team or infrastructure to support the hardware, things started breaking for customers, while the company had very little insight into how or what was going on.</p>
<p>Enter me: a bright-eyed bushy-tailed electrical engineer. At the time my main interests were electric motors, power generation, power distribution, RF. Essentially, I was enamored with Maxwell's equations the applications of that set of equations. This is what I daydreamed about and believed the engineering profession would offer. Instead, I found a desk with a gigantic heap of Salesforce support cases all labeled with "Tablet broken/power problem" and a command from on high: "Nick, to delight customers, the product should <em>Just Work</em>. Sort through these cases, figure out why they aren't <em>Just Working</em> and make the tablets <em>Just Work</em>."</p>
<h3>3rd Party Libraries Warrant Suspicion</h3>
<p>After spending a few hours reading through the cases and finding no technical information in any of them, I uncovered a clue. There was a very noticeable uptick in the number of reports starting at a particular date. I asked the development team for the release notes of the product that runs on the tablets from around the dates I suspected something odd of happening. What did I find?? They shipped a bouncing text animation that was driven by a 3rd-party npm package. I proceeded to measure and benchmark the app with and without the animation. The package increased the application's power consumption by 2.5x. Our wall chargers were suddenly unable to supply enough power for the hardware to have a net positive power profile. <strong>LESSONS LEARNED</strong>: be suspicious of code you didn't write, and always have detailed release notes.</p>
<h3>They Still Don't <em>Just Work</em></h3>
<p>"Okay, great job kid", my boss told me after we ripped out the power-sucking package and hardware cases began to decline. "But what are you going to do about the baseline <strong>5%</strong> of our devices that have never <em>Just Worked</em>?"</p>
<p>The next day at standup I made a naive suggestion. "After reading all of the support cases and noticing a complete lack of technical information, it is clear with our current processes we are not going to gather and document the data that I am going to need to diagnose our problems. We need to re-train the Ops team to be more diligent and thorough about collecting and documenting this information." I proudly declared this expecting someone, somewhere to heed the call and scurry away to kick the big re-train initiative off. Instead, my words just bounced off the empty halls. My managers probably just laughed. Then gave me some advice. "You want to skin a cat, you're gonna have to do it yourself. Figure out a way to get that information yourself. It will be much more reliable at the end of the day."</p>
<h3>To Live is To Dream</h3>
<p>So finally our young hero (me), finally got a chance to do what he had always wanted: to dream and to build. I dreamt up a system for getting telemetry from all of the tablets we had in the field.</p>
<p>Here's what I deemed necessary for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client code to access the information from each device while it was in the field and report it back in a heartbeat</li>
<li>An event database to hold all the incoming heartbeats from devices</li>
<li>A robust way to pipe all of the heartbeats from the devices to the event database</li>
<li>An application that I could use to query my data and build dashboards that could paint a picture of what's going wrong with the devices</li>
</ul>
<h3>Client Code</h3>
<p>I knew that there was a plethora of hardware information hidden amongst the /sys/class special files on the tablets. All of our tablets were rooted, so I knew that I had access to all of this, the only problem? Our instore application that ran on our tablets was built using Angular and Cordova. This meant that to access system-level data from the device I would have to write a Cordova plugin to pass that information up to the JS layer. I wrote some modular code that could run command line commands with root privilege and parsed the responses. This I then passed up to the application/JS layer and wrote some code to send up to our WebSocket servers at 15-minute intervals.</p>
<h3>Server Code</h3>
<p>To allow for fast and reliable communication between tablets belonging to a single merchant, the product team built a WebSocket service that all of our tablet clients connected to. Because the connections between our devices and the WebSocket server stayed open for long periods of time, I knew that routing the data through this server application to its final destination, the event database (which our servers also kept open connections with), would be the most robust way to get the data from the devices to me. When operating in the sketchy unknown networking environments of small businesses you can never be too careful. I set up the servers with the Treasure Data’s client library and wrote some code to receive the heartbeats from our devices and send them along.</p>
<h3>Event Database</h3>
<p>I then set up a table in Treasure Data with a schema that matched the payload of the heartbeats. Soon 20k tablets from across the United States of America would be sending all their unhealthy secrets to this special little DB, with the bland and boring name (in comparison to the power that it would hold!) of <code>device_usage</code>.</p>
<h3>Finding The Root Cause</h3>
<p>Now that I had data directly from the source on my hands, I finally felt that I was in a position to diagnose some problems. I could cross-reference hardware serial numbers from support cases with data from my database to understand exactly what might be going wrong with the broken tablets. Furthermore, with the aggregate dashboard, I had made, I could estimate the real size of our problem...and it was big.</p>
<p><img alt="Dashboard showing the count of tablets that were dying every day in the field. Almost 600 per day!" src="https://potemkinlife.com/static/images/dying_tablets.png"></p>
<p>It was immediately obvious that many of the tablets were just not plugged in while being operated, causing the tablets to die and then end up in the dreaded DoD (Depth of Discharge) mode. Let's just jot that down as an unsolvable user error for now (I designed a solution for that as well, but not in the scope of this post). Many more tablets had something much more insidious going on. They were dying while plugged in. And you can be sure at this point that I had confirmed that the application we were running was no longer consuming 2C (C being the max amount of current the battery was rated to accept while charging). So what was going on?</p>
<p>I found a few culprit devices and pulled their individual data and graphed them in a time series to try and find patterns. This is what I got:</p>
<p><img alt="Net Current into Battery vs. Time" src="https://potemkinlife.com/static/images/net_current.jpg"></p>
<p>From the graph above I began to piece together what was going on. Something was limiting the current entering the device's battery. Current limiting on its own is not a cause for alarm: lithium-ion batteries require a power management IC (integrated circuit) to sit between them and the 5V transformer. It is that IC's job to make sure that as the battery reaches its maximum capacity, it should stop pumping in current; if a lithium-ion battery keeps receiving current while it is fully charged it can ruin the chemical composition of the battery and in turn reduce the amount of lifecycles the battery will have. The problem here though was that our IC was limiting the current <strong>before necessary</strong>, and once it started limiting the current <strong>it wouldn't stop</strong>.</p>
<p>I found the datasheet for the offending IC and took a look at its state machine diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="State Machine Diagram" src="https://potemkinlife.com/static/images/state_machine.png"></p>
<p>Reading this I realized that the IC would think the battery was finished charging and begin limiting the current anytime the voltage that the battery detected at the input was below the voltage of the battery. So, unless there was a bug in this IC and it wasn’t working as described in the datasheet, there must be something weird going on with the only input of this system: the voltage detected at the battery. This voltage is what comes from the wall-wart transformer (measuring many samples with a multimeter gave me values between 5-5.2V), then down the cable that we provided the customers. If the voltage drop between the transformer and the device (along the cable) was too high then the voltage detected at the battery might be artificially low, and lower than the voltage of the battery before the device reaches full capacity! Eureka!</p>
<p>I immediately grabbed one of the <strong>3 m</strong> long cables we shipped with the tablets to customers and cut it open. <strong>face palm</strong>. Incredibly thin-gauged wires, braided with some material so brittle that the braids were snapping with the slightest bend. Knowing that the resistance of a conductor linearly increases when it's cross-sectional area decreases, I figured that as these cables were wearing in the field their cross-sectional area (which was already small due to a thin gauge) was getting smaller when braids split, resulting in a large voltage drop along the cables we provided. This linear drop in voltage non-linearly affected the power profile in our devices due to the logic of the current limiting IC.</p>
<h3>The Dreamer's Solution</h3>
<p>I brought my findings to the team and from there we worked to source cables with much lower resistance and a higher tolerance for wear. We began shipping those cables to new customers and to all of the businesses that I had identified as having a …</p></div></div>

    					<div>
    					    
        					<p>The effect of Open Sourced Software on the world is undeniable. From Android and Linux, which are used by literal billions of people, to Wordpress, GIMP, VLC, and Firefox, OSS (Open sourced software) is truly utilized by everyone, in nearly every aspect of their daily lives. This doesn’t even include the millions of open sourced softwares embedded in the web for every day use. Yet, the tech industry is still the most prosperous on earth, with Silicon Valley accounting for a higher GDP output than Finland (roughly $275 billion per year), and all tech stocks accounting for roughly 1/5th of the worlds economic output.&nbsp;</p><p>How is it than an industry that drives the entire planets economy can be based off of something free-to-use, and still be valuable? Simple: Everyone in the industry benefits from the common core of open source tech - They utilize this common base to propel their proprietary technology farther than it could have ever gone without the OSS. The sum of all these parts is greater than the whole. They don’t prosper <i>despite</i> the free software, they prosper <i>because</i> of the free software.&nbsp;</p><p>So, why cant Open Source principles be applied to other industries? Why can’t farming equipment have a common core of open sourced hardware for all farmers in all parts of the world to use? Why cant there be open sourced genetics, where GMO foods are cataloged, modified, and shared by farmers, both with CRISPR and with natural methods? What about building materials and designs? Medicines? Economic data? Camera tech?&nbsp;</p><p>The potential in all industries of what is possible when Open Source principles are applied is staggering. Organizations, both public and private, could have a shared design understanding across entire disciplines, making everyones products work better, sharply increasing both competition and performance for consumers, and in turn increase market saturation and profits for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Specialized companies could still stay specialized. If you offer a particular service that utilized ideas you created, you would have no obligation to share those secrets: Instead, you would have the option to base them on a common footprint of ideas shared by industry leaders, non-profit orgs, and failed businesses that have released their own ideas for the common market to use. Their incentive to do this is two-fold: One - if they are an industry leader - is a way to offload old ideas into the market and build pedigree and reputation among the industry - it shows you are not just a leader, but a supporter, of the industry you participate in. Second - if they are a startup - is to prove your capabilities so that prospective buyers, investors, etc can gauge your prowess on the market. Finally, a failed business might want to offload its ideas that have not sold as a gesture of goodwill - this is something we simply don’t do right now, but there’s no reason we couldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, the benefits of encouraging Open Source principles in new industries is obvious. I predict that if another industry, like farming, decided to adopt this model they would see huge success from its adoption over time. I personally believe that OS principles could become a polestar for economic growth in the future, and would very likely lead to the rapid technological expansion of any given industry once employed. The future quite literally could be now.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We started Avo in 2018 because we believe we can change the way organizations use data to make better decisions for their customers. We’ve been blown away by the impact Avo has had on data quality and developer productivity for our customers. From startups to consumer brands like Rappi, Patreon, TripAdvisor, Sotheby’s, and more, it’s been incredible to see our product fundamentally change the way PMs, devs and data scientists collaborate to plan, track and govern their product analytics. Today, we have some exciting news to share about our progress, a new powerful product offering, and where we’re headed next.</p><h3><strong>What is Avo?</strong><br></h3><p>Avo is next-generation analytics governance. We’re changing how product managers, developers, and data scientists plan, track, and govern analytics across organizations. Before Avo, teams were forced to choose between product delivery speed and reliable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>By using Avo, <a href="https://www.avo.app/customers/patreon-case-study">Patreon has reclaimed 9 out of every 10 hours they used to spend implementing or fixing analytics</a>, going from 4 days for every feature release, to 1 hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies have never had to understand their customers better or faster. Consumers choose the product with the best experience and companies can’t afford to stall product decisions while waiting days or weeks for answers from a centralized BI team. In truth, the industry gold standard is to decentralize business intelligence completely, so that every team is autonomous in making data-driven decisions quickly. Spotify is just one example of a company working under this org-structure.&nbsp;</p><p>But data is brittle and bad data leads to incorrect assumptions. With everyone making data-driven decisions, it’s critical to govern data quality, iterate quickly on the product and business, and avoid customer churn.&nbsp;</p><p>We solved this problem ourselves at QuizUp, to ensure engineering and product time wasn’t wasted re-implementing analytics every time we shipped to our 100M users. Avo solves this more permanently as a SaaS platform without diverting precious time from the core product or accruing technical debt. The result is that we’re helping organizations grow by removing friction around analytics governance and implementation.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Introducing Inspector</strong><br></h3><p>The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what’s wrong with your data. Typically, getting that understanding has been a company-wide initiative that takes months or years, and requires buy-in and collaboration from the VP Product, Head of Data, and VP Engineering.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the <a href="https://www.avo.app/inspector">Avo Inspector</a>. Avo Inspector plays into our larger vision of empowering self-serve analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspector processes event streams, parses event shapes (no PII data), visualizes the entire current state of tracking for the company, highlights tracking issues such as type mismatches, missing properties, and volume discrepancies. We built Inspector because we had helped our customers do this manually too many times.&nbsp;</p><p>With Inspector, our customers get instant insight into what is wrong with their analytics, so they can prioritize the most important issues to fix, and start cleaning and future proofing their analytics step-by-step.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we’re getting great early feedback. On-demand delivery unicorn Rappi is just one of the customers using Inspector:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“This year we scaled to meet the demand of 100,000 new customers digitizing their deliveries and curbside pickups. The problem with every new software release was that we’d break analytics. It represented 25% of our Jira tickets.” Says Rappi’s Head of Engineering, Damian Sima, “In our first week with the Avo Inspector, we’re already discovering tracking issues like missing properties and type mismatches. Now we know what to fix and can do that with Avo.”</em></p><p>Here’s how Inspector works:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f4fffd07427330a5584cc9a_EP8HHtAWyyYFT40Q93yVn2-4m1ztt0M79hnPQzq2R72DazHV_JHbrq_tN4CeYZ7Grx_ZcS06XO9pUqVFUGXhxrbFh5S56WakXhTgaQ5PzrV9jcYNCiF4u9kJTssTJ5smUWQyDU4N.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Inspect your current tracking automatically</strong></p><p>Install the Inspector SDK to observe a living summary of current tracking across platforms. Inspector doesn’t gather any user data, only event shapes and volumes.</p><p><strong>Analyze tracking issues instantly</strong></p><p>Inspector dashboard highlights your current event tracking issues, so different stakeholders can discuss and prioritize what to fix.</p><p><strong>Prioritize what matters</strong></p><p>The inspector dashboard gives you and your team the overview you need, to prioritize the tracking changes that will have the biggest impact on cleaning up mission-critical metrics so you can make progress quickly.</p><p><strong>Clean, step-by-step</strong></p><p>Use your complete overview of what needs to be fixed across platforms, to fix top priority issues with clear event and property definitions, implemented with type safe analytics.</p><p><strong>Future proof</strong></p><p>Great product analytics help teams make the best decisions to grow their business. Truly useful metrics for today and beyond are transparent — where everyone knows which events can help answer their questions — and reliable, consistent data, easy to evolve and implement as the product grows.</p><p>If you’re curious about the infrastructure and behind the scenes (as you should be!), <a href="https://www.avo.app/inspector">learn more about Inspector</a>, <a href="mailto:hi@avo.app">reach out</a> or subscribe to our <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/avo">newsletter</a>.</p><h3><strong>Avo is scaling with the help of world-class developer and data tool investors</strong></h3><p>To build on our momentum, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/avo-raises-3m-for-its-analytics-governance-platform/">we’ve raised $3M</a> from GGV Capital with participation from Heavybit, Y Combinator and others, to make Avo a game changer for democratizing analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d like to use this opportunity to thank all the incredible people who have believed in our team and our mission, and supported us throughout this journey. A special shoutout to Hjalli and Investa, Gustaf, Jared, Aaron, Kevin, Kat, Michael and all the YC folks, Joe, Tom, Dana, Jesse and James at Heavybit, Glenn, Oren, Tai and the entire crew at GGV, the Brunnur team, Jenny and co at Crowberry, Pete at Optimizely, Coby at Radar, Sandy, Ari and more. In addition to our investors, we’re surrounded with smart and generous people who have hosted us on their couches in San Francisco, helped us hire, advised us on Avo, introduced us to great people, et cetera; thank you to Spencer, June, Gunni, Jói, Aliya, Drew, Kiddi, Siggi, Hilmar, Arndís, Andrés, Kjartan, Paul, Gummi, Vala, Austin, Brian &amp; Michael, Leslie, Shuo, Alex, Ron and so many more.</p><p>Sölvi and I are proud to have been joined by an <a href="https://www.avo.app/about">outstanding team</a> of exceptionally kind, talented, and driven humans on this mission, who we are honored to be working with every day.</p><p>Our focus in the coming months will be helping more organizations uplevel their analytics governance fast, so they can join the global shift to self-serve analytics culture. We will also continue to focus on developer experience and seamless collaboration between product managers, developers and data scientists – because we don’t want teams to have to choose between product delivery speed and reliable analytics anymore.</p><p>‍</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://www.avo.app/jobs">We're hiring! </a>Come work with us in our remote-first culture (since way before COVID 😅) and diverse and inclusive team 💛</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><article><div><div><p><img src="https://www.pachyderm.com/images/blog-images/hub-ga-announcement-hero.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Today we’re announcing the production ready availability of <a href="https://hub.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm Hub</a>, our powerful end-to-end machine learning and data lineage platform in the cloud. Hub delivers all the key features of the <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a> suite but in a completely managed cloud-native environment. You no longer need to have Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure expertise in-house, Pachyderm Hub let’s you seamlessly spin up a cluster in minutes.</p><p>While Pachyderm always delivered the power teams needed to do data science at scale, you also needed a strong systems administration and architecture team to get Kubernetes and containers into production. Kuberenetes is way more than just software you download and install. It needs monitoring and management, backup, redundancy, capacity and upgrade planning, to name just a few. That represents a real challenge for some organizations. Now, we’ve removed the barriers to entry, which makes it possible for smaller teams to start doing data science faster.</p><p>Pachyderm Hub includes all of the features that were challenging for teams to set up, like autoscaling with GPUs, security and isolation, backup, and automation. Now you can rely on Pachyderm’s trained team of Kubernetes experts to handle the infrastructure for you and concentrate on data science instead of systems administration. Kubernetes is powerful, but the real power comes from the applications you can run on it.</p><blockquote><h4 id="you-simply-bring-your-code-and-data-pachyderm-hub-handles-all-the-infrastructure">You simply bring your code and data, Pachyderm Hub handles all the infrastructure.</h4></blockquote><p>More than anything, Pachyderm Hub delivers on our ultimate vision for a fully collaborative, shareable, and reproducible data science platform. It does what Git did for data, bringing powerful version control and collaboration to your AI applications development. Pachyderm Hub makes team collaboration and sharing data, code, and infra totally seamless. Team members can create and share workspaces, invite other team members to collaborate, and behind the scenes the platform scales transparently as you add workloads.</p><p>Since our launch 2014, Pachyderm’s data science platform has quickly become a foundation for the <a href="http://ai-infrastructure.org/">emerging Canonical Stack (CS) in machine learning</a>. Because other platforms only let you track metadata, they lack the true iron-clad immutability of a robust version controlled file system. If your data can change after you’ve recorded your metadata then you can’t reproduce critical data science results. Our customers understand the need for true data lineage and data versioning. That’s why over the past year, Pachyderm has attracted tremendous new enterprise customers like Shell, LogMeIn, Battelle Ecology, and AgBiome, as well as multiple government agencies, pharmaceutical and bioinformatics companies, two major North American banks, and other Fortune 500 powerhouses.</p><p>Beyond data versioning, customers choose Pachyderm because they need a clean, simple and elegant data science pipeline system that delivers data science at scale. The Pachyderm platform allows teams to bring any framework, language or library and fit them together into a smooth, automated workflow with ease. If it can run in a Docker container it can run on Pachyderm.Customers aren’t locked into one tool like Spark, R or Python, or one machine learning framework, like Pytorch or Tensorflow. They can use it all on one complete system.</p><blockquote><h4 id="launch-your-free-workspace-todayhttpshubpachydermcom"><a href="https://hub.pachyderm.com/">Launch your free workspace today!</a></h4></blockquote><p>If you’re ready to do production workloads you can easily upgrade to benefit from GPUs and enterprise team collaboration, just <strong><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/request-a-demo/">talk with one of our experts</a></strong>, or join our <strong><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/slack/">open source community on Slack</a></strong> and check out the Pachyderm codebase on <strong><a href="https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm">Github</a></strong>.</p></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

                    <p>There is no doubt that geopolitics is a major driver of TikTok’s fate in the United States. But if and when it does get sold, <strong>it’s still a multi-billion dollar transaction</strong> that has to make <em>some </em>business sense.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/what-is-tiktok-worth-to-whom-and-why/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>I have written quite a few posts on <a href="https://interconnected.blog/tag/bytedance/">the various political and regulatory angles</a> of TikTok already, so I won’t belabor those points here (though I do hope you give them a read for context of my general thinking). Instead, I’ll focus on how to think about what part of TikTok is worth, to whom, and why, in particular for Microsoft+Walmart and Oracle -- the two most likely groups of bidders to successfully buy TikTok.</p><p>Typically, an acquisition of any size needs to make sense along at least one, but hopefully more than one, of these dimensions:</p><ul><li>Product synergy</li><li>Users and data</li><li>Core technology</li><li>Brand</li><li>Company and people</li></ul><p>Let’s take a look at the relative value of each of these in the context of TikTok.</p><h2 id="product-synergy-cloud-and-e-commerce">Product Synergy: Cloud and E-Commerce</h2><h3 id="cloud">Cloud</h3><p>The entire global cloud industry is still relatively young, growing quickly, and thus all the major vendors are in “land grabbing” mode, trying to gobble up market share first before worrying about profitability. But the landscape is also transitioning to “differentiation” mode, where cloud providers are looking for ways to “stand out”. While you can do a fair amount of differentiation with aggressive marketing, the <strong>most effective way to “stand out” is to demonstrate what types of workload your cloud can handle better than everyone else in the industry.</strong></p><p>That’s where TikTok comes in. TikTok, as a product, has a unique set of workloads that requires:</p><ul><li>storing and processing a ton of videos;</li><li>visual search with computer vision;</li><li>live streaming;</li><li>running AI algorithms continuously to serve different feeds and ads for different uses;</li><li>(increasingly) e-commerce transactions directly in the app.</li></ul><p>Thus, it’s no surprise <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-agreed-to-buy-more-than-800-million-in-cloud-services-from-google">that TikTok uses both AWS and GCP</a> as its two cloud providers in the US -- the same two providers that Snap uses. <strong>Being the “visual communications” company, Snap’s workload is the closest mirror to TikTok’s, even though it lags far behind in AI, live streaming, and e-commerce.</strong> (Snap spends handsomely on these two clouds, which I did a deep-dive on in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/aws-gcp-real-winners-in-snapchat-growth/"><strong>AWS and GCP Are the Real Winners in Snapchat’s Growth</strong></a>” a few months back.)</p><p>For either Microsoft or Oracle, acquiring TikTok and running the product on its cloud will help differentiate itself from AWS and GCP along these workload dimensions. This differentiation is not just a marketing practice, <strong>but a real stress test of engineering</strong>. It’s a stress test that both Microsoft and Oracle lack, because they have always been enterprise software companies with little or no experience running consumer applications at scale. <strong>Both firms are good at being “enterprise ready”, but not at being “Internet ready”.</strong> And the ability to handle workload stress at scale is what cloud customers pay for.</p><p>To proxy what kind of “stress” a cloud can handle, it’s helpful to analyze the company’s other core businesses and the workloads required to run them well. (As an example of this type of “stress test” analysis, see a two-part series I wrote a few months ago profiling all the major cloud platforms: <a href="https://interconnected.blog/stress-test-public-cloud-alibaba-aws-azure-gcp/">AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud</a>, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/stress-test-other-cloud-ibm-oracle-tencent/">IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Tencent Cloud</a>.)</p><p>Based on Gartner’s new global cloud market share analysis released in August, the top five players are: <strong>AWS, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, GCP, Tencent.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KoXxbtRmkrTN_VpEkgjufnsjYCUvlsb-pp-9rY5aTuc0AI42k2j4KobOY0lPLiCrix5xTSEaFPETEN-2d9wWvS_ZbfgL2tatSoEAWe8Q2kZkwBpV3YcHzYy6Bog2hlZpXUiIegWQ" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-10-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-point-3-percent-in-2019</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone is still trying to catch up to AWS. As for the brand-name laggards who didn’t make the top-five cut, namely Oracle and IBM, they urgently need to catch up, both by continuing to invest in building data centers and product R&amp;D, as well as “stress testing” its product to differentiate.</p><p>What’s why Larry Ellison aggressively pursued Zoom as a customer (and succeeded) earlier this year when Zoom was going through hypergrowth (see “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/why-zoom-chose-oracle/"><strong>Why Zoom Chose Oracle”</strong></a>). IBM should have been in the picture as well, but is likely busy absorbing its massive acquisition of Red Hat that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-its-34-billion-acquisition-of-red-hat.html">just closed last July</a>.</p><p>Having TikTok run on your cloud especially while it’s rapidly growing <strong>(</strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html"><strong>100 million MAUs, 50 million DAUs, 800% MAU growth since January 2018</strong></a><strong> in the US)</strong>, and run it well without downtime or performance degradation, is <strong>a legitimate accomplishment and extremely valuable for differentiation</strong>. After all, TikTok did reach 1 billion users faster than any social media app in history (even though it’s not really a social media app, more on that later).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MqT8455iJ3H5zH969ghbs7NNtxP48W05Vyjn8LXTSBiXQejIiBjSJuk17wpIgJbuYuLQ2861PST2bEgd6wVA4UILUxfYb5LvNbWibBRicVrRyec7Oo1sDAdu04_MmZIAb2pEp73J" alt=""></figure><h3 id="e-commerce">E-Commerce</h3><p>The e-commerce synergy with TikTok is weaker than the cloud one in the short-term, but will become increasingly important in the long-term. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, already has many e-commerce capabilities like buying items directly from a video or livestream feed. These capabilities are becoming table stakes in the Chinese e-commerce space, but are quite novel in the US and Europe.</p><p>Large retailers are all trying to transition into e-commerce ASAP to not continue losing market share to Amazon, and hopefully surpass it one day with new ways to shop. From that angle, the Walmart alliance with Microsoft to bid on TikTok is very forward looking. Microsoft and Walmart already have a tight relationship on cloud, <strong>with a </strong><a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2018/07/17/walmart-establishes-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft-to-further-accelerate-digital-innovation-in-retail"><strong>5-year partnership inked in 2018</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Walmart is about to launch its Amazon Prime competitor, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200831005784/en/Walmart-Introduces-Walmart">Walmart+, on September 15</a>, coincidentally (or not) on the same day as the US government deadline to sell (or ban) TikTok. While Walmart+ is still a nascent product, merging TikTok’s e-commerce potential with it, <strong>or even just creating the perception of that happening</strong>, will do wonders to Walmart’s reputation as becoming an innovative tech company.</p><p>That does beg the question: why wouldn’t Amazon try to buy TikTok too? The truth is: Amazon has already been working with TikTok to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/for-tiktok-an-amazon-ban-that-wasnt-a-wells-fargo-ban-that-was">allow users to buy directly on Amazon,</a> advertising, and <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/tiktok-rolls-first-app-television-amazon-fire-tv/">even content for Amazon Fire TV</a>. Some of those partnerships will likely continue regardless of who ends up owning TikTok. Sadly, buying TikTok outright is a fool’s errand due to the simple reality that Trump doesn’t like Amazon. His disdain towards Jeff Bezos is well-documented. AWS is <a href="https://interconnected.blog/aws-vs-azure-return-of-the-jedi/">still fighting for a piece</a> of the Defense Department’s JEDI cloud contract with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/04/pentagon-reaffirms-microsofts-jedi-cloud-win-despite-procurement-mistake/">a pending lawsuit alleging political interference</a> from the Trump White House. There are already too many insurmountable hurdles.</p><p>As with all things related to TikTok, politics has a way of intruding.</p><h2 id="users-and-data">Users and Data</h2><p>Given TikTok’s staggering growth and the staggering amount of data being collected from its user base, acquiring those users and their data is obviously valuable; no insight here. And depending on what you read, TikTok’s data collection practice <a href="https://medium.com/@fs0c131y/tiktok-logs-logs-logs-e93e8162647a">is either “just as bad”</a> as the likes of Facebook and Google, or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-tracked-user-data-using-tactic-banned-by-google-11597176738">demonstrably worse</a>.</p><p>What is worth thinking about is whether the acquirer has a good enough reputation to be entrusted with that data, whether it can derive value from the data, and keep growing the product to <em>get more </em>data.</p><p>Both Microsoft+Walmart and Oracle have decent reputations when it comes to data governance largely because their core business is either enterprise software or brick and mortar retail, where collecting user data is not at the center of their business model. This characteristic also makes them more trustworthy when it comes to national security concerns related to TikTok’s data. <strong>The irony of this reputation is that it’s built from their very ignorance in operating a product like TikTok.</strong> While it’s helping with the acquisition and various regulatory and public relations hoops the transaction will need to jump through, it also makes TikTok’s future business value and growth more murky.</p><p>Microsoft has had a bit more experience with consumer applications via acquisitions than Oracle, with LinkedIn and GitHub. However, LinkedIn is a first-generation social media product used primarily for enterprise sales or recruiting, not entertainment. GitHub’s status as a social network of the world’s developers is <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/08/10/turning-open-source-developers-into-superfans/">accidental at best</a>. <strong>TikTok is not even a social media platform; it’s an algorithm-driven entertainment platform.</strong> I frankly don’t find Microsoft’s “experience” <em>that</em> relevant to its ability to run TikTok well.</p><p>The value of data is also tightly connected to the AI algorithms that make use of it, which is TikTok’s core technology. Is TikTok’s data more valuable than its technology?</p><h2 id="core-technology">Core Technology</h2><p>I’m going to go out on a limb and opine that TikTok’s core AI technology is not worth as much as its users and data. This is one of those “strong opinions, weakly held”, but here’s why I believe that’s the case.</p><p>The <a href="https://interconnected.blog/how-do-we-tax-cloud-computing/"><strong>concept of “data density”</strong></a><strong> </strong>is what determines a lot of the value in a technology business. In the <strong>cloud industry</strong>, convincing your prospective users to migrate and store their data in your cloud is the most important step in growing long-term customer value. <strong>That’s why cloud storage is cheap (or comes with steep discounts), </strong>but compute resources and networking bandwidths are not. In <strong>e-commerce</strong>, the accumulative data on your shoppers’ preferences, behaviors, and habits is much more useful than the actual value of the items they buy. Same for an <strong>ad-funded social network</strong>. Same for a <strong>self-driving car company</strong>, whose cars need to self-drive millions of miles -- a “data density” building exercise -- before reaching the necessary level of safety and stability.</p><p>With “data density”, whichever combination of Deep Learning AI algorithms or frameworks (many of which are open sourced and commoditized) you apply to the data, you’ll get some powerful results.</p><p><strong>Without “data density”, the algorithms will not be able to live up to their full potential, regardless of how “smart” or optimized they are.</strong></p><p>This is <em><strong>not to say</strong></em> that TikTok’s algorithms <em><strong>are not</strong></em> valuable. Of course they …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>When you learn a language, you think of words in it differently than how you think about words in your native tongue. I like the word “deflect.” I don’t know why, but it just has a nice ring to it. I like it so much that I worked on a (shuttered) developer-tool SaaS by that name some years ago. Do you know who else likes deflection? You, most likely.</p>



<blockquote><p>“No matter what I say, they keep doing the same things.”</p><p>“They don’t care about the product, only working on interesting tech.”</p><p>“Product keep defining work wrong.”</p><p>“The CEO wouldn’t allow it.”</p><p>“The team simply doesn’t have a high-bar culture.”</p></blockquote>



<p>How long has it been since you’ve said something along those lines, out loud or to yourself? Even the best executives I work with do this deflection by reflex from time to time. It’s leadership aikido.</p>



<h3>It might be true</h3>



<p>I can almost hear you mutter to yourself, “wait a minute! Those are all true!” I agree. The team might genuinely not care about the product right now. Perhaps the culture is out of whack when it comes to craftsmanship and quality. </p>



<p>That’s the only reason that deflection works as a coping and defense mechanism. If you’d simply say something that was clearly false, someone would call you out on it. You have a correct observation, at least subjectively. The issue is that you are abducting your responsibility for it.</p>



<h3>Total Ownership</h3>



<p>The most successful executives I work with are those who internalize that the vast majority of limits are self-imposed. If you deflect and put the blame on someone else, you teach yourself to be helpless. With time, you genuinely come to believe that you are powerless, as detailed in the (excellent) book Learned Optimism.</p>



<p>Reconsider the deflections above and think about what your role is in making those statements true. Why would the CEO allow something if you failed to make an articulated argument? This team you’re talking about, who hired it? Who has been managing and leading it?</p>



<p>Is everything entirely up to you? Of course not. A lot <em>is</em>, though. If you take ownership of the matter and decide to act, you will find ways to move forward in most cases. Do you know how just being told there’s a solution makes you find it? See a chessboard with the question “what would you do now,” and you might feel at a loss. Instead, if the prompt was “find the mate in two,” you are significantly more likely to find it. I once spent 90 minutes in an exam trying to prove P=NP because the instructor made an error writing the exam. I was told the given problem had a polynomial solution, and I gave it a damn good try.</p>



<p>Address your work problems with the same mindset. Take complete ownership. If you still come up empty, consider <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/">getting some help</a>. But don’t just deflect.</p>

<p>We started building ghcide over 2 years ago as part of our efforts at Digital Asset to provide a great IDE experience to all <a href="https://daml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML</a> users. As a lot of people in the Haskell community know, the DAML compiler is based on a modified version of GHC, so naturally the people working on it were Haskell programmers. As ghcide got better and better, and we got to experience it whenever we were working on DAML codebases, we started missing the same features from our Haskell development. Over time, we started abstracting over DAML-specifics and eventually managed to get it working on some hand-crafted Haskell projects, but couldn’t integrate with Cabal, Stack or other build tools. Around that time, we also open sourced the whole <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML codebase</a> which included ghcide – but we didn’t announce ghcide anywhere. Luckily, at this time Matthew Pickering released <a href="https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hie-bios</a> which made it trivial to integrate ghcide with all of the various build tools in the Haskell system while still using the same codebase as the basis for the DAML IDE.</p>



<p>External interest in ghcide was very limited until Neil gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cijsaeWNf2E&amp;list=PLxxF72uPfQVRdAsvj7THoys-nVj-oc4Ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keynote at MuniHac 2019</a>. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="MuniHac 2019: Making a Haskell IDE" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLxxF72uPfQVRdAsvj7THoys-nVj-oc4Ss" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Interest and external contributions skyrocketed over a few days and we split ghcide into a separate repository to make it easier for contributors and users that no longer had to deal with the DAML monorepo. Since then, there have been a huge number of contributions to ghcide that not only benefited Haskell users, but also DAML users. It is impossible to name all the amazing features that have been contributed to ghcide, but some of our favourites include:</p>



<ul><li>Support for code completions</li><li>Many significant performance improvements</li><li>Multi-component support</li><li>A wide variety of code actions</li></ul>



<p>In January 2020, a lot of ghcide contributors and contributors from <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-ide-engine</a> got together and agreed to unify their efforts as part of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-language-server</a> – which builds on top of ghcide while carrying over all the features and plugins that came from haskell-ide-engine. Half a year later, it’s not a stretch to say that this endeavour has been an enormous success and enthusiastic statements from users can attest to this. Finally, most efforts on Haskell tooling are focused on a single approach and everyone can benefit from improvements.</p>



<p>As the importance of ghcide to Haskell tooling has grown, keeping such an important repository in the Digital Asset organisation with only Digital Asset employees as maintainers has started to hold back the flood of contributions. Therefore, in consultation with many of the contributors, Digital Asset has made the decision to turn ghcide into a proper community project under the <a href="https://github.com/haskell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell</a> github organization. In making this transition, ghcide gains a much wider team of maintainers, sourced from the current active ghcide contributors. The DAML IDE will switch to an open source fork of ghcide and cherry-pick changes from upstream as needed and we will continue to upstream bugfixes and improvements into ghcide.</p>



<p>We are very excited to see in which directions ghcide will grow in the future.

The students' <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/a-vidnyanszky-fele-kuratorium-lemondasat-kovetelik-az-egyetemet-elfoglalo-diakok" target="_blank">list of demands</a> includes:<br></p><ul>
<li>guaranteed autonomy for the university</li>
<li>the revocation of the law which alters their university's management model</li>
<li>the resignation of the new board of directors</li>
<li>reinstatement of powers to the democratically elected senate&nbsp;</li>
<li>rejection of the new method of appointing university leaders and board members</li>
<li>continued state funding of the university</li>
<li>that the administrative rights over the university not be transferred to the foundation.</li>
</ul><p>At a press conference in front of the building on Tuesday, a delegation of students said they would only allow current staff and students to enter the building until further notice. According to an <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/felmeres-az-szfe-hallgatoinak-100-szazaleka-elutasitja-ahogy-az-egyetem-vidnyanszkyek-kezebe-kerult" target="_blank">internal poll</a> taken by the university's Students' Union (HÖK), 100 percent of student respondents rejected the restructuring, and nearly 70 percent believe&nbsp;its true aim is the "long-term, ideological and political occupation of the institution.”</p><p>As a result of the restructuring, key decision-making powers will be exercised by the board of directors of the foundation, including adoption of operational regulations, budgetary decisions and development plans, as well as the selection of the rector and the appointment of department heads. Members of the new board of directors include two executives of the state-owned energy company MOL. The chairman of the board is Attila Vidnyánszky,&nbsp;<a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/29/itt-a-vege-vidnyanszkyek-kezi-vezerlessel-iranyithatjak-az-szfe-t" target="_blank">a former director of the Hungarian National Theatre</a> who has routinely made <a href="https://szfe.hu/hirek/egyetlen-kerdes/" target="_blank">derisive comments</a> about SzFE and its faculty, and is considered to be a close ally of the ruling Fidesz party.&nbsp;</p><p>

Some observers also&nbsp;<a href="https://444.hu/2020/06/24/kevesebb-raforditassal-nagyobb-kontroll-errol-szol-az-egyetemek-alapitvanyi-kiszervezese" target="_blank">predict that the quasi-privatization of SzFE and other Hungarian universities will result in further state divestment from higher education</a>&nbsp;while reducing the universities' autonomy.</p><h2>Citizens of V4 countries may enter Hungary despite border closures</h2><p>Citizens of three central European countries will be <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/a-csehek-mellett-a-lengyelek-es-a-szlovakok-is-belephetnek-magyarorszagra" target="_blank">granted exceptional permission to enter Hungary</a> following coronavirus-related border closures that took effect on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced on Monday.</p><p>

On Monday, the exception was extended to all citizens of V4 countries.<br></p><p>Critics of the decision argued that entering Hungary is now easier for foreign citizens of the V4 than for Hungarian citizens returning from abroad: upon arrival, Hungarians must submit to a 14-day quarantine period which can only be abridged by two negative PCR tests conducted in Hungary at their own expense. (Orbán's chief of staff earlier said that the government does not consider tests conducted abroad to be reliable.) The exception allows V4 citizens to enter with only one test, conducted in their own countries, and does not require quarantine. Similar exceptions were made for <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/egy-kulfoldi-sportolonak-sokkal-egyszerubb-bejutnia-a-frissen-lezart-magyarorszagra-mint-egy-magyar-allampolgarnak" target="_blank">foreign participants in Hungarian sporting events</a>.</p><p>On Monday, two members of the European Commission <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/unios-biztosok-levelet-irtak-a-magyar-kormanynak-a-visegradi-orszagokkal-valo-kivetelezes-miatt" target="_blank">wrote a letter to Hungary</a>,&nbsp;arguing the exceptions for V4 citizens threatened "the integrity of the Schengen area and of applying border measures in a non-discriminatory way to all EU citizens and residents."</p><p>The government defended the border closures by saying that introduction of the coronavirus from abroad represents the greatest epidemiological risk. However, a pandemic advisor to the government said in an interview Monday that <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/nagyon-veszelyes-jarvanyugyi-helyzetre-figyelmeztet-a-kormanynak-szakerto-matematikus-professzor" target="_blank">less than 10 percent of new virus cases in Hungary can be attributed to foreign travel</a>.</p><p><a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/a-jarvany-szempontjabol-erthetetlen-miert-kivetelezunk-a-visegradi-orszagokkal-a-hatarokon" target="_blank">Recent statistics from the V4 countries</a> raise questions over Hungary's decision to grant travel exemptions to their citizens: daily new coronavirus cases in Czechia, Slovakia and Poland have risen dramatically in recent days with Poland registering six times more daily cases than Hungary.

The first involved Hungary's public broadcaster "showing deliberate and clear bias in favour of the Fidesz party," while the second presented "extensive evidence around the government’s market-distorting practices" in distributing state advertising in media outlets.&nbsp;The letter claims that the distribution of such advertising "follows no market logic" and is "almost exclusively geared toward propping up pro-government media".</p><p>"We are seriously concerned that the Commission’s failure thus far to respond to these complaints perpetuates the Hungarian government’s market-distorting practices and allows for the further decimation of independent media in the country," the letter reads. "The <a href="https://insighthungary.444.hu/2020/07/23/resignations-begin-at-index-after-firing-of-editor-in-chief-protest-for-press-freedom-planned" target="_blank">turmoil at Index.hu</a> shows clearly that the situation will continue to worsen.

<p><span>

20 Apr 2019

</span></p><p>In 2011-2012 I worked on FIFA Street, followed by FIFA EURO 2012 DLC and finally FIFA 13 - all of these games were based on the same codebase, and this codebase was HUGE. Given an unknown codebase, you need a way to quickly get around it - since you don’t know the code, you resort to search-based navigation, aka grep. Using Visual Studio Ctrl+Shift+F search on a HDD on a codebase this size means that every search takes minutes. This was frustrating and as such I decided to solve this problem.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I wanted a tool that was much faster than existing alternatives<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and was able to perform both literal and regular expression searches at similar speed. At the time, the only existing tool that gave near-instantaneous results was <a href="https://github.com/google/codesearch">Google Code Search</a> - unfortunately, the performance on case-insensitive queries or some types of regular expressions at the time wasn’t very good<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Thus I decided to make a new tool, <a href="https://github.com/zeux/qgrep">qgrep</a><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. This article will go over the design and performance optimizations that make qgrep really fast.</p>

<h2 id="how-fast-are-we-talking-about">How fast are we talking about?</h2>

<p>Remember, qgrep was written in 2012, so the competition at the time was grep, ag, Visual Studio Ctrl+Shift+F, and the hardware target was a multi-core CPU with an HDD. Today the golden standard of performance is set by <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, which runs much faster than the alternatives, and the norm is to use an SSD. Still, qgrep is <em>much</em> faster.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s try to search for a simple query, <code>vkCmdDrawInde.*KHR = 0</code>, in UE4 codebase which is similar in size today to FIFA codebase from 2012. We’ll run qgrep and ripgrep twice: first time is after a reboot so the filesystem cache is cold, and second time is immediately after that. The timings are done using my desktop system with i7 8700K (6 cores 12 threads) and Samsung 970 EVO SSD (which is an M.2 NVMe drive) on Windows 10, using latest ripgrep/qgrep x64 builds. Here’s the hot run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\work\qgrep&gt;build\Release_x64\qgrep search ue4 S "vkCmdDrawInde.*KHR = 0"
C:/work/unrealengine/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Vulkan/Include/vulkan/vulkan.hpp:44478:    PFN_vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCountKHR vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCountKHR = 0;
Search complete, found 1 matches in 0.03 sec

C:\work\unrealengine&gt;rg --stats "vkCmdDrawInde.*KHR = 0"
Engine\Source\ThirdParty\Vulkan\Include\vulkan\vulkan.hpp
53924:    PFN_vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCountKHR vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCountKHR = 0;

1 matches
1 matched lines
1 files contained matches
118457 files searched
143 bytes printed
1237500936 bytes searched
3.651454 seconds spent searching
1.216025 seconds
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here’s the table of timings in seconds; here we also run qgrep with a <code>b</code> option that will be explained later (it stands for <code>bruteforce</code>):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>tool</th>
      <th>cold</th>
      <th>hot</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>qgrep</td>
      <td>0.42</td>
      <td>0.03</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>qgrep bruteforce</td>
      <td>0.66</td>
      <td>0.08</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ripgrep</td>
      <td>10.2</td>
      <td>1.2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It’s possible that if in 2012 I used SSDs and ripgrep was available, I wouldn’t have gone through the trouble of making a new tool - but the pain threshold was crossed so I did and here we are. But how is it possible to make a code search tool that’s so much faster than ripgrep? Why, by cheating, of course.</p>

<h2 id="eliminating-io-bottlenecks">Eliminating I/O bottlenecks</h2>

<p>The single biggest source of performance issues at the time was disk I/O and I/O-related system calls. A recursive grep tool must start by recursively traversing the target folder; as new files are encountered, it needs to read their contents and perform regular or literal search on the results, and print the matches if any. In theory, the filesystem in-memory cache is supposed to make subsequent searches fast; on FIFA codebase, however, both file hierarchy and file contents was never fully in the filesystem cache, especially as you worked on the code (for example, switching to the browser to google something would likely evict large portions of the search data set). Even when filesystem hierarchy was in the cache, retrieving the hierarchy wasn’t very efficient either due to a large number of kernel operations required. As you can see by looking at ripgrep results, the impact is very significant even on SSDs; on HDDs we’re talking about waiting for a minute for the search to complete.</p>

<p>To get around these issues, qgrep maintains a compressed representation of the entire searchable codebase. It’s stored in one file that consists of chunks; each chunk contains a list of file paths and file data, both compressed using LZ4. Files are added to the current chunk up until the uncompressed size reaches a certain threshold (512 KB at the moment) and then the chunk is compressed and a new chunk is started. If a file is very large (which is actually the case for <code>vulkan.hpp</code> at 2.2 MB), it’s broken up into several chunks using newlines as a splitting point which works well because the search is line based.</p>

<p><img src="https://zeux.io/images/qgrep_1.png" alt="File structure"></p>

<p>Chunks are compressed and decompressed atomically in the sense that you can’t update just one file in the chunk - compressor receives a blob that consists of contents of all files concatenated together. Chunks that are too small decrease the efficiency of compression; chunks that are too large make incremental updates and parallel decompression less efficient.</p>

<p>Having a single file that contains compressed representation of <em>all</em> input data means that even if the file is not in the file cache, reading this is as fast as possible since it’s often stored contiguously on disk. Compression is important because HDD read speeds are pretty slow compared to fast decompressors, and compressing increases the chance the files will stay in cache.</p>

<p>One other big advantage is that files can be pre-filtered during indexing to eliminate files that are not interesting to search; qgrep by default includes most text files using file extension as a filter. This means that large folders with, say, build artifacts, only affect the time it takes to update the data, and don’t impact search performance. On UE4 example above, ripgrep looks through 1.2GB of file data, and qgrep only looks through 1.0GB (compressed to 212MB).</p>

<h2 id="why-lz4">Why LZ4?</h2>

<p>An important goal when choosing the compression algorithm was to have decompression run at similar performance to the search itself (which, as you will see soon, can be <em>really</em> efficient). While it may seem that having a slower decompressor is good enough as long as it’s much faster than the disk, when the file stays in cache the disk I/O isn’t a factor so the faster the decompressor is, the better.</p>

<p>At the time a solid choice for having extremely fast decompression performance was LZ4; today Zstd provides an interesting alternative that I haven’t evaluated rigorously for this use case. Snappy was an alternative available at the time but it had slower decompression, and didn’t have a high-compression option. LZ4 also made a lot of progress over the years; several updates to lz4 since 2012 improved search performance on decompression-heavy queries by ~50% in total.</p>

<p>When qgrep was made initially, all focus was on search performance, and the time it took to update the qgrep data wasn’t that important. Because of this, LZ4HC was perfect for the job - at the cost of spending more time when compressing the data, it gave better compression ratios. In later releases a few changes were made to address the slow compression performance:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chunk compression was moved to a separate thread so that it could run in parallel with reading files off disk and performing newline conversion and the like, and writing resulting chunk data to disk</li>
  <li>A lower compression level was used (which is a relatively recent addition to LZ4HC) to trade off a little bit of compression ratio for a lot of compression time.</li>
  <li>The default way to update qgrep data is now incremental - if no files inside a chunk changed and the chunk sizes don’t need to be rebalanced to maintain a reasonable average size, no recompression is performed</li>
</ol>

<p>As a result, it takes 6.5 seconds with hot file cache to rebuild UE4 search data from scratch and 1.2 seconds to update a single file in it; in the latter case most of the time is spent traversing file directory structure.</p>

<h2 id="multi-threading">Multi-threading</h2>

<p>Naturally, qgrep tries to multithread the search process. There’s a single thread that reads chunks off disk, and dispatches them to a thread pool. The threads in the pool handle decompression of chunk data and the search itself.</p>

<p><img src="https://zeux.io/images/qgrep_2.png" alt="Threading structure"></p>

<p>Several important problems arise during this process.</p>

<p>First, the read speed and search speed can be substantially unbalanced. For example, if the data is in file cache, reading it from disk runs at memory speed, whereas decompression and search are usually slower. If the data is really large, it could be the case that the total memory impact of the chunk queue is substantial. Because of this, qgrep extensively uses a <a href="https://github.com/zeux/qgrep/blob/master/src/blockingqueue.hpp">thread-safe blocking queue</a> that has a special twist - when the queue is created, it’s being told how much total memory the queue should hold at most. Whenever an item is pushed to the queue, if the item’s memory impact exceeds the budget, the thread that pushes the item waits for “space” to become available. This makes sure that we can search arbitrarily large datasets with limited memory.</p>

<p>Second, search threads will generate results in an arbitrary order - each thread will generate search results in each chunk in order, but we’d like to display results from different chunks to the user in the exact same order that a single thread would. This means we need to buffer the output results - however, for some search queries the size of that buffer can be arbitrarily large. To solve this problem, qgrep uses a special purpose ordered queue - the way it works is that the producers (search threads) submit items to that queue with an index indicating the original chunk index, and the single consumer that prints the output processes items in the order indicated by this index. For example, if 3 threads finish chunks 1,2,3 quickly and the 4th thread takes a while to finish chunk 0, the output for chunks 1,2,3 will stay in memory until chunk 0 is processed and added to the queue, after which the consumer thread can …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Lately, I have been talking a lot about Crystal - probably too much if you ask my coworkers at Kalvad. So let me explain once and for all why Crystal is such an amazing language and how it will quickly grow in popularity.</em></p><p>Since I started to write code, I have always been looking for the perfect programming language. A language combining clarity, easy of use and performances. Nothing more, but nothing less either. In this quest of perfection, I've being playing with a lot of languages, but I always had some complains with the most famous ones: JavaScript is over-permissive, Python is great, but as all scripted language (Ruby, PHP, ...) they lack of performances. C/C++ or even Rust works well, but at the cost of ease of use and readability. Golang brought some fresh air into Software industry but its package system is terrible. <br>At this point, you might have noticed that I am really picky person. Which emphasize how amazing Crystal is.<br></p><h2 id="crystal-in-a-few-lines">Crystal in a few lines</h2><p>If you check out the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">website</a>, you will quickly grasp the main concepts of Crystal:</p><ul><li>compiled: better performances &amp; limit errors at run time</li><li>statically type checked: means you can omit types but they are still here and the code won't compile if a type is ambiguous. It increase code readability and limit error at run time.</li><li>types are non-nullable by default: crystal said NO to the famous billion dollar mistake</li><li>green concurrency: just like channels in go, Crystal allows to easily run async tasks and share data without using shared memory and locks</li><li>ruby-like syntax: reading crystal is like reading a book. Really</li><li>shards: one of the best package system ever built</li><li>an amazing standard library</li><li>... and lot of other cool things: C binding, macros, native unit test, native template system, everything is an object, etc.</li></ul><h2 id="crystal-in-depth">Crystal in depth</h2><p>Code is worth a thousand of words.</p><h3 id="syntax-and-readability">Syntax and readability</h3><p>Crystal has a Ruby-like syntax, but it also add some cool feature to improve code organization such as modules.</p><pre><code>module Controllers # use module to scope your code

  class ApiResult
    property http_code : Int16
    property message : String
    property data : Json::Any
    
    # our class constructor
    def initialize(@http_code, @message, @data)
    	# automatically set the properties based on the variables names
    end
  end

  class UserController &lt; Controller
    # create a login method which return an 'ApiResult' object
    def login : ApiResult
    
      # '!' by convention means that this function raises an exception in case of failure
      params.validate!

      # '?' means that the function will return 'nil' in case of failure
      user = Models::User.find_by_email? params["email"]
      
      # clear one-liner, '?' here means the function returns a boolean
      return ApiResult.new(404, "user not found", nil) if user.nil?
      
      # last value of a function is automatically returned
      ApiResult.new 200, "ok", {
        token: Services::JWT.encode(user.id.as(String)),
        user: user
      }.to_json
      
    rescue
      # You can add a 'rescue' for the whole funtion. How convenient is that
      ApiResult.new 500, "Oops. Something happened!", nil
    ensure
      # And finally you can use 'ensure' to always run a piece of code
      Services::Log.action "new login"
    end
  end
end</code></pre><h3 id="types">Types<br></h3><p>Types in Crystal are very powerful. Crystal is a strictly typed language but thanks to type inference, the compiler will be able to assign types by himself. Therefore, unless the type of a variable is ambiguous for the compiler, you can omit to write it down.</p><p>On top of that, types are non nullable by default but can be set as nullable by adding a '?' at the end of the type declaration. Let see some code.</p><pre><code># return 'hello' if @input is an Int32 or a null value if @input is a boolean
def hello_world(input : Bool|Int32) : String? # since this function can return a null value, we need to set the return value as a nullable string using '?'
  typeof(input) == Int32 ? "hello" : nil
end

def main
  puts hello_world(true) # =&gt; "[nil]"
  hello_world(1) # =&gt; "hello" 
end</code></pre><h3 id="everything-is-object">Everything is object</h3><p>And you can extend everything ! The code below parse a YAML file and push the content into an array.</p><pre><code>class Array(T)
  # Extend the Array class to add a new class method
  def self.from_envcr_yaml_file(file_path : String)
    # Simply read a YML file from a pathname and parse it into an array of EnvItem defined below
    File.open(file_path) { |f| Array(T).from_yaml(f) }
  end
end

module Envcr

  class EnvItem
    YAML.mapping(
      name: String,
      optional: {type: Bool, default: false},
      default: String?,
    )
    def eval
      # do whatever you need here with the values
    end
  end

  def load!(file_path : String)
    # Use the newly created 'from_envcr_yaml_file' function method to build an array of EnvItem from a YML file
    Array(EnvItem).from_envcr_yaml_file(file_path).each { |x| x.eval }
    #...
  end

  # ...

end</code></pre><h3 id="standard-library">Standard Library</h3><p>The Crystal standard library offers a lot of amazing features. As a direct result, the different libraries and frameworks will rely on the same core components. And you know what is cool about that? You will always get back on your feet even with when learning a different library/frameworks.</p><p>See, below are 2 piece of code from 2 different projects using 2 different frameworks. However, notice how both simply expose the standard <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.34.0/HTTP/Request.html" rel="nofollow">HTTP request object</a><br></p><pre><code># Middleware inside a Kemal project
class AuthMiddleware &lt; Kemal::Handler
    def call(context)
        return call_next context if context.request.headers.has_key?("Authorization") == false
            || context.request.headers["Authorization"] == ""
        user_id = Services::JWT.decode(context.request.headers["Authorization"].split(' ')[1])
        # ...
    end
    # ...
end</code></pre><pre><code># Middleware inside an Amber project
  class Auth &lt; Amber::Pipe::Base
    def call(context)
        return unauthorized context unless context.request.headers.has_key?("Authorization")
            &amp;&amp; context.request.headers["Authorization"] != ""
        parse_jwt context, context.request.headers["Authorization"]
        # ...
    end
    # ...
end</code></pre><h3 id="shards">Shards</h3><p>Shard is the package system of Crystal. And it's one of the best out there. You can simply create a new crystal project using <code>crystal init</code> :</p><p> - <code>crystal init app cool_stuff</code> will generate a new binary application<br> - <code>crystal init lib cool_stuff</code> will generate a new library</p><p>In both case, the folder created will look like that:</p><pre><code>├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── shard.yml
├── spec
│   ├── cool_stuff.cr
│   └── spec_helper.cr
└── src
    └── cool_stuff.cr</code></pre><p>Congratulations, you just created a new Crystal shard. You can then edit 'shard.yml' to add dependencies, edit the author or add a description, and once you are done, you can simply push your project on github (on https://github.com/dlacreme/cool_stuff for example).</p><p>And once your project is available on github, you can import it on any other Crystal application:</p><pre><code># shard.yml
dependencies:
  cool_stuff:
    github: dlacreme/cool_stuff
    branch: master</code></pre><h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-crystal">What can you do with Crystal?</h2><p>Crystal can be used for pretty much everything. However, I believe it has 2 domains in which it performs better:</p><ul><li>low-level programming. Thanks to its awesome standard library, you can pretty much do everything out of box in a few lines of code. In case the standard library does not have what you need, you can simply embed some C code</li><li>back-end system. Born during the web era, back-end developers quickly built strong web frameworks in Crystal</li></ul><h2 id="current-status-future-of-crystal">Current status &amp; Future of Crystal</h2><p>Crystal is still in beta. Currently running v0.35, it's actually the last version before the first stable release (v1) which is expected before 2021. However, we will still needs a few years to build the whole ecosystem around it. We have some strong frameworks and libraries already, but they all still need to reach their own v1.</p><p>Also, it's important to note Crystal is still not fully running on Windows. It is actually a requirement for the v1 of Crystal and this is one of the main focus of the core team. Hopefully, this won't be an issue for long.</p><h2 id="why-crystal-will-slowly-climb-to-the-top">Why Crystal will slowly climb to the top &nbsp;</h2><p>To end this post, and now you have a better overview of what Crystal can do, let me explain why I think Crystal will become one of the major programming languages:</p><ul><li>readability and access: Crystal is very easy to learn and it's even easier if you have some experience with Ruby. Crystal can easily be used by a wide range of developers.</li><li>performances: Crystal is fast. Very fast. And fast is always better</li><li>release error-less product: thanks to unit tests, strict types and non-nilable types, you can only build stronger products</li><li>fast development: with its awesome package manager &amp; extended standard library, you can focus on the core of your product</li><li>web friendly: Crystal natively provides everything you need to build a web application (native template system, great HTTP standard library). It will slowly slide into every tech-stack</li></ul><p>In short, Crystal is the best and I hope to see you soon into the Crystal community !</p><p>... and I am done for today.</p><blockquote>Have fun coding and talk to you soon !</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By Will Hall</em></p><p>As I am sure many of you know, AWS had an Availability Zone failure within the EU-West-2 (London) region on Tuesday 25th August. But how, where and what do you do when you are a managed services company trying to ensure appropriate availability for your customers across AWS?</p><p>Tuesdays, in August, in the UK, are often punctuated by the drinking of tea, not large failures to happen in AWS. Realistically, datacentre major events are not particularly common, and major outages are even less common, largely due to either extreme natural phenomenon or scaled configuration errors (where the latter is far more likely).</p><h2>All was not OK in EU-West-2</h2><p>From a HeleCloud perspective, the first thing to alert us to the issues was the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) we run for one of our customers informed us that there was degraded performance across an ElasticSearch cluster. Whilst these events are not regular, they are also not unheard of. That said, in such cases we move between infrastructure, releasing instances from the failing piece of infrastructure and quickly rebuild within a new location without any performance degradation. However, this event was not the same as we were having issues communicating via the API. The AWS API is the core connection between the outside world requesting resources and infrastructure and the datacentre.</p><p>Upon seeing these alerts, we immediately opened a request with AWS Support highlighting the challenge and set about trying to understand the scope and complexity of the issue. When referencing back, we were aware of the issue around 02:16 PT, which was around 10 minutes after AWS had become aware of the issue (addressed in later status updates).</p><h2>Diagnosing the issue</h2><p>One of the great advantages of us running Managed Services for many clients is that not only do we have experience of a great range of different challenges but we also have a range of different estates that are simultaneously running infrastructure across the whole of AWS, so you can compare across different accounts, Regions and Availability Zones to discover outages more quickly.</p><p>Whilst the Managed Services team were keeping our customers informed on the potential issues, we were also reaching out across the company to build a consensus about what the issue was and how we could aim to mitigate it. By using our knowledge across the AWS estate, we could see that the problem was focussed on EC2 and RDS instances and further investigation showed us that it was within the euw2-az2 availability zone (also called eu-west2b).</p><p>A good secondary check is always to check various places on the Web to see if others are complaining about outages also. Reddit and Twitter are usually quite fast in these kinds of outage situations. This is just to support the results of our investigation and for us is just another data point that we like to keep an eye on.</p><h2>Beginning to Resolve the Issues</h2><p>Now that we had diagnosed the issue as being EC2 and RDS in euw2-az2, we started mitigation efforts to resolve our issues. With the root cause being both within connectivity and performance of the infrastructure in that Availability Zone, it was not simply a question of restarting the instances, which should move to working hardware. As you are probably aware, running in multiple Availability Zones is part of AWS architectural planning and normally you would plan to run instances in more than 1 Availability Zone for exactly this kind of situation, however, the first thing to do was identify all of the failing underlying infrastructure to start to mitigate the problem. The process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Identify anything running only in euw2-az2 (that is going to be failing now)</li><li>Identify anything running partly in euw2-az2 (that is going to be underperforming)</li><li>Migrate or move anything that can be moved to other availability zones where possible.</li></ol><p>For services such as RDS, the challenge was within database servers that were only located in a single AZ as multi-AZ databases were already mitigating the issue to a different availability zone. Having effective infrastructure as code meant that we were able to move the majority of these services, within a short window and architecturally there were very few single AZ databases. In general, we avoid running RDS instances in production environments in a single Availability Zone for exactly this reason.</p><h2>Minimal Disruption Migration</h2><p>As with any kind of issue resolution, the aim is to provide minimal disruption to end services whilst resolving the problem, for instances that were already within euw2-az2 they already had severe degradation and therefore it was critical to be able to move them from that availability zone to another to recover applications and services.</p><p>We began looking to move services out of the Availability Zone within the first hour of the issue and ran team-wide discussions on how to best resolve with minimal disruption. We mention minimal disruption as with being a managed services and professional services company it is important to run our customer workloads with the utmost of care. However, within the first 2 hours of disruption, we were able to resolve, mitigate and address 80% of the issues within the AZ.</p><div><figure><img src="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-1019x1024.png" alt="" width="815" height="819" srcset="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-980x985.png 980w, https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-480x482.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20815%20819'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-980x985.png 980w, https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-480x482.png 480w" data-lazy-src="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-1019x1024.png"></figure></div><h2>What We Learnt from the Outage</h2><p>There are a few learnings to come from the recovery of euw2-az2. Firstly, it does matter that you architect your solutions to be multi-availability zone (multi-AZ). There is a big difference between being multi-region (EU-west-1, EU-west-2, EU-central-1) and multi-availability zone and for the majority of production services, <strong>we would not recommend anything that does not run across multiple availability zones.</strong></p><p>Secondly, there is no replacement for knowledge and experience. Having a team of our best people working and probing to try and find the limits and extent of the issue was vital in us both understanding and mitigating the problem quickly. I would suggest that when this situation arises again, get together with other clever people (whether that be internally on Slack/Teams or externally on Twitter) and try to find solutions.</p></div></div>]]>

September 3, 2020 | https://octetz.com/docs/2020/2020-08-30-window-manager/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://octetz.com/docs/2020/2020-08-30-window-manager/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Conversations around window managers can be a little contentious…but for some of us, it makes very little difference. I'm one of those humans. As much as I adore nerding out around some ultra-minimal window manager that requires you change settings by compiling its c code, at the end of the day I gain little benefit from any specific approach.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AK2UKUfsV3g" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>That said, I do love and prefer Linux. The fact that we're afforded these choices around window managers is what draws many of us in initially. Your computer, whether running Ubuntu or Arch, can flip a switch to run a very capable, heavy-weight manager such as <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> or a manager with a binary size of ~1mb, such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>. Before diving too deep into my day-to-day workflow, let's set some primer around window managers.</p><h2 id="window-managers">Window Managers</h2><p>Window managers come in two, primary, varieties. These include stacked and tiled. Tiled are commonly composed of several “workspaces”, which can be switched through and host one or many windows, tiled side-by-side. They (typically, by default) do not allow windows to stack or overlap. The following screenshot, from Wikipedia, demonstrates this for i3.</p><p><img src="https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why-i-dont-care-about-my-window-manager/i3.png" alt=""></p><p>Stacked window managers, on the other hand, are what we conventionally think of. Especially those of us that have a history with OSX (mac) or Windows. These window managers give us floating windows that can overlap and be moved into any format on our screens. The following screenshot, from Wikipedia, demonstrates this for xfce.</p><p><img src="https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why-i-dont-care-about-my-window-manager/xfce.png" alt=""></p><p>From my experience, many have associated the move to tiling managers as a more hardcore approach to interacting with Linux. Or at least one we associate with focus, minimalism, and/or getting things done. Over the years, some using i3 and others using dwm, I have found my productivity remain relatively static. I did have some super cool layouts that I loved looking at. However, I am a habitual over-optimizer. This trait sends me down constant rabbit holes of thinking through what workspace I should assign to which tasks, how I should be setting up a tiling layout for optimal focus, and many more considerations. Eventually I realized this constant customization was causing me more loss in focus than the gain I'd hoped to have leaving stacked managers behind.</p><p>In short, this was a me problem, not a tiling window manager problem. Knowing myself better now, I have switched back to stacked managers, with optimizations and automation focused around my key priorities.</p><h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2><p>My priorities around workflow are fairly straight forward. Given I have the attention span of a small squirrel, my key priorities are:</p><ol><li>Switch between key applications quickly</li><li>Switch between key applications with minimal context-switching</li></ol><p>So switching between applications, this isn't too hard in any window manager, is it? Sure, it is not. However minimizing the thought required to jump from a to b is huge for my work. For example, at the most intense end of the spectrum, clicking around and moving windows to find firefox is less than ideal. Even using flows like alt+tab or a launcher requires me to think about where the thing is or how to find/focus it. Additionally, the applications I care about and need to switch between are fairly minimal in quantity. There are maybe 7 total with 4 key ones I constantly toggle. These are:</p><ul><li>Web Browser (firefox)</li><li>Terminal (st)</li><li>IDE (intellij)</li><li>File browser (nemo)</li></ul><p>For me, the question is, with a key or two, can I bring up the application I need to get the task done no matter where it preexisted. Additionally, if the app isn't running, can I transparently launch it without being concerned about another shortcut or workflow? This is where my most important trick comes in, a script named <code>lof</code> (launch or focus).</p><h2 id="launch-or-focus-lof">Launch or Focus (lof)</h2><p><code>lof</code> is a simple script that does exactly what the name implies. If the app isn't running, it launches it. If the app is, it focuses it. <code>lof</code> is not a unique solution. For example there is <a href="https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp">jumpapp</a>, which is a far more capable tool than <code>lof</code>. I have chosen to write <code>lof</code> because it is less than 20 lines of shell script (when comments are removed), easy to understand, and handles 97% of my use cases.</p><p><code>lof</code> can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop/blob/master/s/lof">octetz/linux-desktop repository</a>. I have <a href="https://octetz.com/docs/2020/2020-02-23-linux-desktop-configuration/">another blog</a> post on how I use this repo, if you're interested. At the time of this writing, the script looks something like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span># lof: launch or focus</span>
<span># this script checks whether an app is running and</span>
<span># if running, focuses the window</span>
<span># if not running, launches the app</span>

<span># this script is likely called from another command or script</span>

<span># usage: lof [arg]</span>
<span># [arg]: provide the full path, arguments, and flags representing the process</span>
<span># The value of arg will be looked up literally in the process list by wrapping [arg] in ^ (start) and $ (end)</span>
<span># for example, to ensure the correct firefox window is launched, lof would be used as follows:</span>
<span># lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox</span>

<span># for web-based apps, nodejs-natifier can be used to generate a desktop binary</span>
<span># https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-nativefier</span>

<span># this script assumes the app exists and wmctrl is installed</span>
<span># checks do not occur to ensure optimal performance</span>

APP_NAME<span>=</span><span>"</span>$1<span>"</span>

<span># find pid for app process</span>
<span># -f includes the entire process details, including arguments and flags</span>
APP_PID<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>pgrep -f <span>"</span><span>^</span><span>${</span>APP_NAME<span>}</span>$<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

<span># if app is not running, start it</span>
<span># if app is running, focus it</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> -z <span>"</span>$APP_PID<span>"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then</span>
  <span># launch app</span>
  $APP_NAME
<span>else</span>
  <span># using the pid, find the window id, then focus it</span>
  wid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>wmctrl -lp | grep <span>"</span>$APP_PID<span>"</span> | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span><span>)</span>
  <span># -R moves the window to the current desktop AND brings it to focus</span>
  wmctrl -iR <span>"</span>$wid<span>"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>lof</code>'s goal is to determine if an app is running and if it's not, launch it. If it is running, it stores the process id and correlates that to the window id. Once the window id is found, it focuses the window, using a tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmctrl">wmctrl</a>. For example, my usage of <code>lof</code> for firefox is:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
</code></pre></div><p><code>lof</code> expects to resolve the <strong>exact</strong> command when it runs <code>pgrep</code>, this enables <code>lof</code> to be very specific around what window it looks up. If you're interested in the gory details of how these pieces fit together, keep reading this section. Otherwise, you should skip to the next section.</p><p>To understand <code>lof</code>, it is important to understand how window ids and process ids are related. Technically, we can look up windows by their titles, however, many applications re-title their window based on the context of where the user is in the app. Thus, correlating process id to window id is preferable. Assuming firefox is running, you can lookup its window id with <code>wmctrl</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wmctrl -lp

0x01800003 -1 <span>899</span>    taco xfce4-panel
0x01000028 -1 <span>945</span>    taco Desktop
0x02e00006  <span>0</span> <span>1139</span>   taco tmux
0x0300004d  <span>0</span> <span>2804</span>   taco linux-desktop – lof
0x03200003  <span>0</span> <span>5276</span>   taco Arch Linux - Mozilla Firefox
0x06200006  <span>0</span> <span>7115</span>   taco VLC media player
</code></pre></div><p>In the above desktop, <em>Arch Linux - Mozilla Firefox</em> is clearly the firefox window. The process id is <code>5276</code> and the window id is <code>0x03200003</code>. Since <code>lof</code> resolves based on the process's command, we should look that up using the process id.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ps <span>5276</span>

PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
<span>5276</span> pts/2    Sl    13:49 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
</code></pre></div><p>And just like that, we know that <code>/usr/lib/firefox/firefox</code> is the correct argument to send to <code>lof</code>. When <code>lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox</code> is run, <code>pgrep</code> is used to resolve a process with that <strong>exact</strong> command. If <code>pgrep</code> returns no result, <code>lof</code> executes the command it was fed as an argument. If <code>pgrep</code> did find a result, it can use the process id to run the above <code>wmctrl -lp</code> command and resolve the window id via <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wmctrl -lp | grep <span>5276</span> | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span>

0x03200003
</code></pre></div><p>It then uses <code>wmctrl -iR</code> to focus the firefox window.</p><p>And that end-to-end is <code>lof</code>! There are times where some apps, such as those requiring JRE, need more love than <code>lof</code> can handle. In those cases, rather than making <code>lof</code> smarter, I chose to write a slightly modified script. You can find an example with my <a href="https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop/blob/master/s/lof_intellij">lof_intellij</a> script in GitHub.</p><h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2><p>The glue that holds this all together is the shortcuts or key bindings. For key bindings, I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys">xbindkeys</a>. The reason I prefer it over other tools, is its generic approach to capturing mouse or keyboard events. Captured events can execute scripts in <strong>any window manager</strong>. This means that when I randomly decide to switch back to dwm, all my keys bindings come with me.</p><p>xbindkeys, assuming it is installed, can be added to your <code>~/.xinitrc</code> file to launch when you start your window manager. An example of mine is:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">exec xrdb ~/.Xresources &amp;
xset r rate <span>150</span> <span>60</span> &amp;
<span># only required when wm does not have compositor</span>
<span># exec picom &amp;</span>
feh --bg-scale ~/photos/wallpapers/current.jpg &amp;
xbindkeys -p &amp;
<span># options are dwm, i3, and startxfce4</span>
exec startxfce4
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>-p</code> flag tells <code>xbindkeys</code> to poll the rc (configuration) file for changes. The last step is to setup this rc file to include the <code>lof</code> commands. The rc file is, by default, located at <code>~/.xbindkeysrc</code>. On my machine, a some of the configuration look as follows.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># launch demu</span>
<span>"dmenu_run -fn Hack-16:normal -l 5"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:65
    Mod4 + space

<span># launch browser</span>
<span>"lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:45
    Mod4 + k

<span># launch or focus terminal</span>
<span>"lof st\ \-e\ tmux"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:44
    Mod4 + j

<span># launch or focus nemo</span>
<span>"lof nemo"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:40
    Mod4 + d
</code></pre></div><p>You can see the many uses of <code>lof</code>. The quoted text is the script to be run when an event is detected for the key codes below it. <code>xbindkeys</code> offers a simple way to figure out these key strokes. You run <code>xbindkeys -k</code> and hit the key you want to resolve. For example, this is the result of <code>mod</code> (window key) + <code>e</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xbindkeys -k

Press combination of keys or/and click under the window.
You can use one of the two lines after <span>"NoCommand"</span>
in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc to bind a key.
<span>"(Scheme function)"</span>
    m:0x4 + c:26
    Control + e
</code></pre></div><p>Now, assume you want to use that as a keyboard shortcut for the GUI app <code>blueman-manager</code> (a bluetooth utility). With the app running, you lookup the command.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ps aux | grep -i blueman-manager
josh       <span>11874</span>  2.1  0.1 <span>625088</span> <span>51320</span> tty1   …</code></pre></div></article></div></div>

<p>How Emacs beat vi in the Editor Wars</p>
<p>August 11, 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://trevorjim.com/how-emacs-beat-vi-in-the-editor-wars/">∞</a></p>
<p>In these dark times, we are all in sore need of good news.
Thankfully, I can report some: Emacs has defeated vi in the Editor
Wars!</p>
<p>Some people, laughably, believe that vi is more popular than Emacs.
Fortunately, these fools are completely wrong, and it is easily
proven.</p>
<p>Here’s how.  Take out an iPhone and get it set up with a Bluetooth
keyboard.  Open a web browser and start typing in the address bar.
Try a few Emacs key bindings: control-a (move-beginning-of-line);
control-e (move-end-of-line); control-b (backward-char); control-k
(kill-line); control-d (delete-char); control-y (yank).</p>
<p>That’s right, Emacs is in your phone browser!  With more than 2
billion iPhones shipped, that’s more than 2 billion Emacs
installations.  And if you try other phone or desktop browsers you
just might find that Emacs is in those as well.  But you won’t find
vi.</p>
<p>QED, losers!</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-key-bindings">The importance of key bindings</h2>
<p>Perhaps you are wondering, is it really fair to judge the dominance of
Emacs solely based on key bindings?  What about all of the other ways
in which Emacs is superior to vi?</p>
<p>Rest easy, friend.  Consider that most users of any editor only use
basic features, such as the ones mentioned above (moving to the end of
a line, deleting a line, etc.).  For these users, Emacs and vi are
functionally equivalent—each as powerful as the other.</p>
<p>So, if two editors have the same functionality, what distinguishes one
from another?  It is the way that the editor exposes editing functions
to the user—the user interface.  And for Emacs and vi, which were
created in the early days of text-based terminals without mice, that
means the keyboard interface, i.e., their key bindings.</p>
<h2 id="how-emacs-key-bindings-are-superior-to-vi-key-bindings">How Emacs key bindings are superior to vi key bindings</h2>
<p>We have proven that Emacs key bindings are superior to vi key
bindings: Emacs has won the marketplace, while vi heads to extinction.
But <em>why</em> are they better?</p>
<p>To answer this we defer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler">Larry
Tesler</a>, who
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/2212877.2212896">developed</a>
the now-ubiquitous editor functions, Cut and Paste.  Before Cut and
Paste, moving a block of text in a document was a complex, multi-step
command in editors: it was a <em>mode</em> of the editor, distinct from other
operations such as moving the cursor or inserting characters.</p>
<p>Tesler’s Cut and Paste enables moving a block of text <em>without</em>
introducing a new mode.  In between the operations of Cut and Paste
the user can insert characters and move the cursor as usual; the
normal mode of insert/cursor movement, combined with a simple Cut and
a simple Paste, allows you to move a block of text.  You don’t have to
learn a new, complex mode for this.</p>
<p>This is what Tesler called <em>modelessness</em>.  Now, in reality every
editor has more than one mode, but Tesler argued that fewer modes make
editors easier to use, and Emacs and vi demonstrate this nicely.</p>
<p>There’s an old joke about vi: <em>Once you use vi, you’ll never quit.</em>
This of course refers to the fact that frequently in vi you’ll get
stuck in a mode that you can’t get out of, because you’ve forgotten
what mode you are in, or you’ve forgotten the key binding to get to
the mode in which you can exit vi.  So for example, vi has a mode
where you can insert characters; a different mode where you can move
the cursor, delete lines, and so on; and yet another mode in which you
can do things like quit the editor.  And depending on which mode you
are in, you have to hit a different sequence of keys to quit the
editor.  That’s why “How do I quit vi?” is such a popular Google
search.</p>
<p>Emacs, in contrast, starts out in a mode in which you can do <em>all</em> of
those things.  It crams all of that functionality into one mode by,
you guessed it, using <em>a lot</em> of key bindings involving modifiers like
the Control key and Meta key.</p>
<p>Emacs, to be sure, has many more modes than this, however, most of
these modes simply <em>extend</em> the fundamental mode with <em>more</em> key
bindings to invoke the additional functionality.  Thus the quit
command can be invoked by the same key binding in any mode!  Another
way of putting it is that all of the finger knowledge that an Emacs
user has will probably apply regardless of what mode Emacs happens to
be in.</p>
<p>This is why Emacs, and not vi, is present in the iPhone browser.  It
allows the browser to have advanced functionality (such as moving to
the beginning or end of the address bar) without introducing a new
mode, and <em>without interfering with the simple task of inserting
characters</em>.  This ensures that users who don’t need <em>or aren’t even
aware of</em> the advanced functionality will never get stuck in a
different editing mode.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-emacs">Beyond Emacs</h2>
<p>Emacs is a wonderful editor but nowadays editors are not so important.
Most of the time we are consuming content instead of generating it.
The web browser is now the center of the software universe.  And
although browsers have a little bit of Emacs in their address bars,
the rest of their user interface has taken a big step backwards from
Emacs: their keyboard support is poor.  It’s impossible to operate
most web browsers using <em>only</em> a keyboard, without a mouse or
touchscreen.</p>
<p>There have been a few side efforts to add keyboard navigation to
popular web browsers.  <a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a> has been my
favorite, but it doesn’t seem to have much of a future, as it depends
on old, unsupported technology (XULRunner).  Of current efforts, I
like <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl">Tridactyl</a>, but it only
works with Firefox (for now), and its key bindings are inspired by vi,
not Emacs.</p>
<p>A more fundamental problem is that browser makers simply don’t care
about keyboard navigation, or at least they are incompetent about it.
Their extension capabilities are crippled and their key binding
support is too.  We may be waiting a long time for the Emacs of web
browsers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is <strong>known to be needed</strong> in the product.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog">The Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Ideas do not fit that description. An idea is a “maybe this would be helpful” thing, not an “I know this is needed” thing.</p>



<p>If you have ideas for your product, that’s fantastic and fabulous and you should hang onto them. But please don’t use the backlog for that. Use a roadmap or a hierarchy or a storymap or a text file or literally anything that’s not the backlog.</p>



<p><em>When the time comes to officially plan and refine one of those ideas, that’s when you move it into the backlog. </em></p>



<p>A backlog with things in it that are not <strong>known to be needed</strong> is a backlog with waste. It’s a mountain of inventory to wade when you want to find a specific part. </p>



<p>Here are some signs that your backlog has too much stuff in it:</p>



<ul><li>You’re embarrassed to show it to people, like a messy kitchen</li><li>You start to keep a separate list of important things because you’re worried they’ll get lost and forgotten in the backlog </li><li>You get stressed out when you look at it</li><li>There are tickets from 3+ months ago</li><li>There are tickets that you had forgotten all about</li><li>There are tickets that you don’t even understand</li></ul>



<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. Keep a lean, focused backlog with only the stuff you know you will work on in the next couple cycles, and stop digging through hundreds of tickets you may never get around to starting. </p>



<p>Give yourself the focus and stress relief that comes with a backlog that is free of fluff. It’ll make it easier to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">shut up and plan the sprint</a>.</p>

											<h2>Master the Elements of Grammar</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Japanese Particles are what make Japanese unique as a language. When we study Japanese (or Korean for that matter) having a solid understanding of how particles are incorporated and used to reflect and express states of the mind is crucial.</p>
										<p>Japanese Complete focuses on a "Particles First" approach that teaches all the grammatical particles first. This unconventional technique actually enables the most accelerated learning in Japanese ever, because by frequency, particles are the most frequent glyphs of the language.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Master Japanese Swiftly.</li>
											<li>Retain What you Learn.</li>
											<li>Go All The Way.™</li>

                <div>
                    <p>After I have moved from a tiny tiny apartment 9m^2 in Tokyo to a big one 3LDK (2 western-style rooms, kitchen, living/dining room, and tatami room) I decided that I am going to use one of the westerner rooms as my home office/laboratory and with this idea, a lot of project ideas appeared in my head what I could do with my home office. One of the first projects which I have already finished was getting an Air Conditioner in the home office room</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-7.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-7.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-7.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I bought two Panasonic ACs for the home office and bedroom. The living room already had an air conditioner. They are pretty small and. efficient units for 6 tatamis sized room (~9.72m^2)</p><p>As a European from North Europe Japanese spring/summer has hitten hard for an unexpected guy coming from a different continent. The weather until late May was without any issues pleasant temperatures sunny days and then <strong>THE Rainy Season</strong> came which introduced me with the new term <strong>Humidity</strong> to which I was never used or never had much concern living in Europe. When your room humidity level reaches 70-80% you would want to reduce the humidity level quickly as high humidity can introduce a lot of problems for your apartment. This is where Air Conditioner comes which helps with these issues by utilizing Dehumidifier mode which reduces humidity in the room pretty quickly.</p><p>After this unexpectedly pretty long Rainy season the real summer came up with really high temperatures as far as 35-45ºC which were devastating as my apartment was the top floor so it would heat up to around 32ºC in the home office room as soon as 8 AM. So the air conditioner was a must item in my home office!</p><p>Not to forget the winters in Tokyo can get mildly cold too, but so you know Japanese apartments in most cases lack any central heating system so you have few options to warm up urself:</p><ul><li>Electric Fan Heater (Most common device in Europe I think)</li><li>Electric Radiator</li><li>Electric Infrared Heater</li><li>Electric Blanket</li><li>Kerosine Heater</li><li>Gas Fan Heater</li><li>Gas Heater</li></ul><p>Yes I know burning stuff inside the apartment for westerners would sound crazy but most Japanese apartments there are special pipes/tubes in walls with covers for exhaust fumes, etc. same with air conditioners their special pipes for passing air conditioner refrigerant/electrical lines to the outside.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-8.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-8.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-8.png 1002w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You probably would not believe if I told you that the small square socket near the bottom big pipe is a gas outlet. Yes, <strong>GAS </strong>outlet and the most interesting thing is it is in every room so technically I could run Gas heaters (which someone told me are cheaper than electrical counterparts) to heat rooms but that's for later on it is still just the beginning of Autumn!</p><h2 id="the-reason-why-i-choose-panasonic-air-conditioners"><br>The reason why I choose Panasonic Air Conditioners</h2><p>One of the main reasons I choose Panasonic was because my living room had Panasonic AC cs-409cfr2-w which was provided with an apartment from all 4 rooms only one living room had AC preinstalled. I had in plan to make my apartment a bit smarter I guess so I found out that Panasonic AC (In Japan don't know other countries as they heavily differ in features) I decided to go with Panasonic as they had special modules which are plugged into AC and then connects to Gateway module which would allow me to control all AC remotely.</p><h2 id="i-wouldn-t-be-an-engineer-if-i-would-not-try-to-take-apart-them-before-they-were-installed-by-professionals">I wouldn't be an engineer if I would not try to take apart them before they were installed by professionals</h2><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-10.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-10.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-10.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-11.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-11.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-11.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-12.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-12.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I had to take them apart as I will need to install radio modules myself as I was scared that AC installers going to charge extra as in Japan all services usually cost extra and it's not cheap!</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-13.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-13.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>One of the things I like about Japan that almost everything has a schematic on there somewhere hidden makes trying to understand things much easier.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-14.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-14.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Everything looks so clean!</p><p>This module connects to the LAN and bridges all Panasonic 920Mhz compatible devices to the network.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-15.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-15.png 640w"></figure><p>At first look, it didn't look that small, and first thought it was running some arm embedded Linux or similar stuff as it is usual with IoT devices.

Of course, I could try to buffer those changes and send one request but then it would deny the whole idea of making it quicker to use. So I scrapped the idea but the code is still here if anybody is interested:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/aurimasniekis/homebridge-eolia"><div><p>aurimasniekis/homebridge-eolia</p><p>A Panasonic Eolia Air Conditionner integration into HomeBridge - aurimasniekis/homebridge-eolia</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>aurimasniekis</span><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15481?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p>So what I can do to make it better. Then I found out that Panasonic Wireless Gateway also exposes as Echonet Lite gateway and all air conditioners are available to be commanded via it without any limitations. After playing around with several libraries (Compared to other protocols and automation standards these severely lacks community libraries 😣) I managed to produce some code that was able to control ACs with the easy and best thing it's instant and no Beeping sound perfect for thermostat style operation!</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-26.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-26.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-26.png 1045w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So far I haven't done anything more regarding Echonet Lite integration but I have some plans which I want to work on one of them is to make the Echonet Lite to Web API bridge interface but this time to use Golang as I have done some light coding in a different project (Which I am going to soon release an article about pretty soon)</p><p>The next article in this series will be my home office workbench design and construction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>There are plenty of DevOps myths&nbsp;circulating the developers’&nbsp;community. This is no surprise, considering how much excitement the DevOps concept has brought&nbsp;over the recent years.</p>



<p>The DevOps methodology can provide significant positive effects for organizations when implemented properly. It can <strong>lower costs, boost efficiency</strong>, and <strong>make the work of development teams more streamlined</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in order to grasp the strength of this&nbsp;process, it is necessary to recognize what DevOps represents. That’s why, in this article, we address some of the most popular DevOps myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 1: DevOps is all about CI/CD&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s the same thing as CI/CD. The truth is that continuous integration and delivery are <strong>the key components of DevOps</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DevOps focuses on the culture and responsibility in a team. It emphasizes the need for everyone on the team to take part in each other’s tasks. This improves <strong>collaboration and communication</strong> in the team.</p>



<p>On the other hand, CI/CD enables this culture with software and tools that emphasize automation. You can see them as <strong>a means to an end</strong>.</p>



<h2>Myth 2: DevOps means NoOps</h2>



<p>NoOps describes the concept where the cloud infrastructure is so automated, that there is no need to manage it.</p>



<p>NoOps is considered as<strong> the next evolution of DevOps</strong> as a development model. Just like DevOps, its goal is to improve software delivery, but by allowing developers to focus on application development instead of infrastructure and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, you can automate the setup, deployment, and monitoring processes, getting closer to NoOps.</p>



<h2>Myth 3: Automation eliminates all bottlenecks&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Automation is one of the biggest benefits that DevOps provides. But <strong>it’s not a silver bullet</strong> that will solve all your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A continuous delivery process enables teams to roll out new features quickly. And, get the feedback they need really fast. This, of course, means that you have to ensure the product’s quality. Moreover, you have to take care of how well it runs and its performance when scaling. You also need to ensure smooth production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automating your CI/CD pipelines helps <strong>eliminate the bottlenecks between code commit and deploy.</strong> But, this is just one stage of the software delivery process. Unless developers and testers are in a partnership, you won’t be able to resolve all your problems. It’s likely that you’ll only move any bottlenecks to another stream.</p>



<h2>Myth 4: One-size-fits-all continuous delivery pipeline</h2>



<p>The idea that you can have one process that fits all teams and companies is impossible, contrary to popular belief. Every organization has <strong>different needs and requirements</strong>. Even projects in the same organization need different continuous delivery pipelines.</p>



<p>You can have projects that need only two to three environments. For example, development, test, and production environments with frequent deployments. Another project can require more environments since it has multiple stages in the software delivery cycle.</p>



<p>This is why the continuous delivery pipeline should <strong>represent the release process</strong> that the company is already using.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 5: DevOps is all about tools</h2>



<p>Conversations about DevOps are mostly focused around which tools your company is using. They then turn into philosophical battles about what are the best tools. Instead, we should be <strong>communicating about the bigger picture</strong>, the business value DevOps brings to your company.</p>



<p>DevOps means focusing on <strong>culture, mindset, and how individuals work together.</strong> Only after should you be choosing the right tools for your processes. Teams often look in the large ecosystem of tools trying to find the perfect solution at the beginnings. They build DevOps pipelines for a very long time, that should be redone once completed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a87265a6-4a4d-4905-97e9-4129ac78563c/Atlassian%20DevOps%20Trends%20Survey%202020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlassian research</a> showed that the two main factors to implement DevOps successfully are <strong>the right tools and the right people</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>DevOps automation tools like <a href="https://microtica.com/">Microtica</a> allow you to create pipelines and test them in hours.</strong> With these kinds of tools, you can save months of work on pipelines that might not function. </p>



<h2>Myth 6: Software release is the same as in Amazon/Facebook/Google</h2>



<p>Many world-leading companies have adopted DevOps for its benefits and flexibility. Looking at these company’s success stories, we, of course, look up to their achievements. We do this without realizing their context and the steps they made to become that successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing is for sure – these organizations <strong>chose and built the tools and processes that worked best for them at the time</strong>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to follow these organizations. Moreover, what they did won’t magically work for our business as well.</p>



<p>We should learn from them and find new ways to innovate and grow. Explore and find the right processes and tools that define our problem space. What will bring <strong>success to our particular business</strong>? This is what DevOps is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 7: Release all the time</h2>



<p>The idea of frequent releases has companies worried about not releasing their software continuously enough. <em>“Ship often”</em> has become the industry standard. However, this doesn’t specify the time. It may be every two to three weeks, or it may be several times a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing is that you achieve the<strong> team confidence</strong> that enables you to release new software when required. CD is the <strong>ability to release code from the main branch and feel confident in it</strong>. The idea of DevOps is that your code should be releasable anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So remember, continuous delivery doesn’t mean you should release as often as you can but gives you the ability to release <strong>as often as you want.</strong> <em>How often should be up to your company’s decision.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>We hope this&nbsp;article helped you bust some of the most popular DevOps myths that&nbsp;swirl around. Don’t let such misunderstandings hinder the progress of your team. Implementing DevOps can help your company improve productivity and create better products, so don’t miss out on these benefits due to these DevOps myths. </p>

September 3, 2020 | https://andreiglingeanu.me/dynamically-load-js/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://andreiglingeanu.me/dynamically-load-js/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid="8"><p>I feel like dynamically loading modules with
<a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">webpack’s code splitting</a> was
<a href="https://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html">discussed</a>
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-react-loadable-for-code-splitting-by-components-and-routes/">everywhere</a>
and
<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-100-correct-way-to-split-your-chunks-with-webpack-f8a9df5b7758">everyone</a>
is doing it at this point. Thought I’d reiterate on how we do it in
<a href="https://creativethemes.com/blocksy">Blocksy</a> and on the tiny layer of
abstraction we built on top of the <code>import()</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It’s not like I’m about to describe something revolutionary and
an absolute game changer, I just think this approach is quite neat and is very
convenient for our uses cases.</p>
<p>That being said, let’s get started with the problem definition before we even
start to present a potential solution for it. To give a context where this is
very useful, in Blocksy’s
<a href="https://demo.creativethemes.com/blocksy/modern-shop/product/eleifend-donec-pretium-vulputate-sapien-sagittis/">single product pages</a>,
we have a drag-n-drop carousel implemented with a library called Flexy, which we
developed internally (maybe an opportunity for another post to describe its
internals?). Even though this library is not <em>that</em> big, it still has some code
that has to execute to do its thing (handle dragging and dropping, cycling
layout, pills etc) and we’d like to avoid loading it when we don’t need it:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we’re on a page that doesn’t have such a gallery</li>
<li>On products that have only one image, thus no gallery involved</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’d take a look at the page source in the above link, you’d see that the
container that wraps the carousel is a <code>div</code> with the class of
<code>.flexy-container</code>, so that’s how we instantiate the carousel:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code><span>const</span> container <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'.flexy-container'</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> flexyInstance <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Flexy</span><span>(</span>container<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div>
<p>From the server side, we make sure that on pages where there’s no carousel
involved, we don’t output that <code>.flexy-container</code> element at all. So now the
problem is trimmed down to loading the <code>Flexy</code> library only if this element is
present on the page. Here’s how this might look:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code>

document<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span>
  <span>'DOMContentLoaded'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> container <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'.flexy-container'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>container<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./flexy'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> Flexy <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> flexyInstance <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Flexy</span><span>(</span>container<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
          
        <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>false</span>
<span>)</span>


<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Flexy</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span></code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This all works very good, but it gets very clumsy with <strong>a lot</strong> of
conditionally loaded widgets on various pages, so we added some syntactic sugar
over it. Introducing the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/andreiglingeanu/b2c64f87086fefa582e8883cb8098532"><code>handleEntryPoints()</code> and <code>loadSingleEntryPoint()</code> helpers functions</a>.
To not scare you away with the wall of code, I’ve extracted them in a gist.</p>
<p>This looks pretty scary at first, yes, but let’s treat it as an investment into
a nicer experience for defining how things get loaded dynamically. Now our
example with <code>Flexy</code> will look like this:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span> handleEntryPoints <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./helpers'</span>

<span>handleEntryPoints</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.flexy-container'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./flexy'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span><span>)</span>





<span>class</span> <span>Flexy</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>mount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>sliderEl<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> flexyInstance <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Flexy</span><span>(</span>container<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
      </div>
<p>See how easy that was? Now we introduce a convention, the module that gets
dynamically loaded <strong>should</strong> export a function called <code>mount()</code> that accepts
only <strong>one</strong> element as the first argument. If there is any element that matches
the selector defined in <code>els</code>, the process will find all the elements that
matches this selector, will load the module dynamically and when that’s done,
will call the <code>mount()</code> function for each found element.</p>
<p>To summarize, if we’d have two carousels on any page for any reason, this code
would have properly catched &amp; initialized the library for each of them in
isolation.</p>
<p>Now, the beautiful part is that you can add any number of other widgets in the
same <code>handleEntryPoints()</code> call, like that:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span> handleEntryPoints <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./helpers'</span>

<span>handleEntryPoints</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.flexy-container'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./flexy'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.widget-1'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./widget-1-implementation'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.widget-2'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./widget-2-implementation'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    condition<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      
      
      
      
      
      <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.widget-3'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./widget-3-implementation'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div>
<p>Hope you can see how handy this can be when you have a lot of different dynamic
and potentially big components scatered across different pages chaotically.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Depending on your webpack config, loading modules like that will lead in
getting one generated chunk per <code>import()</code> call, resulting in a lot of small JS
files that are dynamically loaded, and thus causing lots of requests. When that
is the case, you can skip the <code>import()</code> part from the chunk definition, but
still use the same <code>els</code>/<code>mount()</code> convention. This can be done as following,
where we make <code>widget-4.js</code> inlined in the <code>main.js</code> chunk:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span> handleEntryPoints <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./helpers'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> mount <span>as</span> mountWidget4 <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./widget-4-implementation'</span>

<span>handleEntryPoints</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.flexy-container'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./flexy'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.widget-1'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./widget-1-implementation'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.widget-3'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./widget-3-implementation'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  <span>{</span>
    els<span>:</span> <span>'.widget-4'</span><span>,</span>
    load<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>r<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> mount<span>:</span> mountWidget4 <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span><span>)</span>




<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>mount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>el<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span></code></pre>
      </div>
<p>This can be controlled pretty easily with tools like
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer"><code>webpack-bundle-analyzer</code></a>.</p>
<p>Hope this was of help and don’t hesitate to shoot me an

<p>Distributed teams are hard. Distributed teams, where some people are in office and others at home, are harder. Widely distributed teams with people working across countries and time zones are exceptionally hard. <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/05/25/working-remotely-social-communication/">Widely distributed teams in a pandemic are damn near impossible to get right</a>.</p>



<p>Culture clash alone is an enormous challenge. I once had a fantastic American product manager piss off an equally strong director of engineering (in India) by complaining that the tool the PM needed “had fallen and can’t get up.” The director—and the engineers on the thread—took it as a tremendous insult, even though the product manager was trying to inject a little levity. The PM should have linked to the commercial:</p>

</p><figcaption>Apparently <a href="http://lifecall.com/">Lifecall</a> isn’t big in India.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Distance, culture, and time zone problems make communicating in remote teams hard.</p>



<p>We have spent trillions of electrons this year on how to lead remote teams, so I’ll stick to something more prosaic: communication tools.</p>



<blockquote><p>Slack, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Zoom – the communication tools you use matter, but not as much as how your organization uses them.</p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=Slack%2C%20Jira%2C%20Microsoft%20Teams%2C%20Zoom%20-%20the%20communication%20tools%20you%20use%20matter%2C%20but%20not%20as%20much%20as%20how%20your%20organization%20uses%20them.&amp;url=https://joseph.by/2020/09/03/how-to-use-communication-tools-well-in-remote-teams/&amp;via=josephby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>Over the past twelve years I have worked in four different distributed organizations. From bootstrapped start-ups to legacy companies. I often found <strong>a lack of alignment caused by the inconsistent use of communication tools</strong>. Solving this required us to be way more intentional in how we communicate.</p>



<p>You need to, as a group, brainstorm, agree to, and communicate out norms of how different communications tools are to be used. When it works you get a written, jointly owned artifact that you can use to orient new team members and bolster the confidence of quieter team members. And when the rules are set up front, collaboratively, people are more like to follow them, and not need correction down the road (which could offend them).</p>



<h2>My List</h2>



<p>So here’s my list of communication tools and how to use them.</p>



<h3>Face to Face Meetings</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that need synchronous communications. Hard (“critical”) conversations. Generative exercises. Things that require dialog. Design meetings, planning meetings, <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08">betting tables</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Status meetings. Networking conversations. Routine discussions.</p>



<h3>Video or Audio Conferences</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that require synchronous attention but less dialog. Structured discussions. Ideally, decisions that are less contentious. Prioritization exercises, design reviews, presentations of an analysis. Collaboration where a small number of people are presenting to a larger number of people.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Energy levels. Remember, <strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/5-reasons-why-zoom-meetings-are-so-exhausting-137404">video is draining</a></strong>. Use it sparingly. Find other ways to ensure that all participants are “present” and attentive. You know your team is healthy if it is present without being threatened by the green camera LED. If numbers admit <strong>take turns, at least once, to make make sure that everyone has a chance to be heard.</strong></p>



<h3>Email</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Asynchronous, text-heavy communication. Wide distribution groups. Not time sensitive. Easy to read (no need to click away to see the content). Things that people may want to consider and respond to. Monthly status update to investors or senior leadership. Summarizes of organizational changes.</p>



<p><strong>Major </strong>🔑<strong>:</strong> Put the most important information into the subject line and lede (<a href="https://joseph.by/2016/09/14/6-prepare-your-intent-a-little-preparation/">more here</a>). Make sure your emails are easy to read on mobile devices.</p>



<h3>Phone and Text</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Getting a hold of someone after hours or while they are away from keyboard (e.g. in transit) and you need a dialog. If you need to get a hold of someone for an emergency after hours, and want a last resort before actually calling them, or don’t need an immediate synchronous response. Always text first #BecauseIts2020 .</p>



<h3>Chat</h3>



<p><strong>Patterns:</strong> Establish clear norms as to when people are / are not expected to be available on slack; use threads to allow people to follow topics. Be aware of timezones; encourage use of Away messages. <strong>Train people on how to manage their notifications, alert settings, and Do Not Disturb. </strong>Don’t assume they’ll figure it out, or will feel comfortable turning it off. <strong>Use public channels</strong>, created for topics, teams and projects. </p>



<p><strong>Anti-patterns:</strong> This is going to need a bulleted list.</p>



<ul><li>Remember that <strong>text loses tone</strong>, and that low-fidelity communication tools like chat can amplify management mistakes. Give people the benefit of the doubt when they seem clueless but <strong>do not tolerate behavior that makes people feel unsafe, particularly by those with power</strong>.</li><li><strong>Chat transcripts ≠ documentation.</strong> If you agree on a behaviour or solution to a problem then <strong>document it somewhere</strong> and link to it from the conversation.</li><li><strong>Chat messages ≠ to-dos</strong> or workflow tasks. If someone agrees to do something in slack, create a ticket in the relevant tracking tool and link to it from the conversation.</li><li><strong>Avoid using #general</strong>. Real conversations should happen in dedicated channels.</li><li><strong>Avoid using group messages:</strong> they’re hard to find, not categorized by topic, and carry and unclear expectation of privacy.</li><li><strong>Limit the use of private channels:</strong> again, they are hard to search and risky to add people to. If people only feel safe in private team channels something bigger is wrong with your organization.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, <strong>chat makes bad managers worse</strong>. The combination of immediacy, reach, lack of nuance, and lack of non-verbal feedback can encourage some incredibly stupid behaviour that can be hard to undo.</p>



<h3>Wiki</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Documentation, references, working documents; Version tracking important;  High-fidelity (fancy formatting) not important</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Things that imply sequence. Workflows, etc.</p>



<h3>Bug Tracking or Workflow Management Tools</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that have a deadline, dependencies, multi-step tasks, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Requirements, specs, designs – anything more than a few lines shouldn’t live in the bug, but should be linked out to a doc from the bug. Bug tracking tools are hell to search.</p>



<h3>Documents</h3>



<p>This includes Google/Word Docs, Slides/Powerpoint/Keynote and Sheets/Excel</p>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Narratives or analyses; work that needs a lot of formatting and high fidelity. Work that changes slowly. Read-aheads for meetings. <strong>Group editing</strong>. Google Docs still has the best commenting tools, although wikis like Confluence has come a long way.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Requirements. Reference documents. Documents that are expected to be maintained over a long period of time. After a project is over things like Word Documents are typically lost in a shared folder, hidden away, and never used again.</p>



<p><strong>Major </strong>🔑<strong>:</strong> Tuck documents away neatly after a project. If they are no longer being updated, add a prominent note to that effect in the top of the document, with a link to other relevant, and more recent information (i.e. a Wiki). <strong>Manage the zombies.</strong></p>



<h2>Things to remember</h2>



<p><strong>Avoid holy wars.</strong> Focus on picking the smallest number of tools that cover the greatest number of use cases, weighted by importance. <strong>Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good</strong>, but be aware of tools with high switching costs (bug tracking, chat) and be careful.</p>



<p>Remember that <strong>the process is as important as the outcome</strong>. You want to have broad support for the list so that influential team members feel ownership and will actively help to improve communication. And finally, <strong>don’t be cheap</strong>. Buy the right version of the tools and <strong>spend the money needed to get them configured and maintained property</strong>. If well paid software engineers are cutting and pasting tickets between bug tracking systems, I will find you.</p>



<p>Above all, <strong>expect change</strong>. How an organization communicates will change. Plan for it.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>In a distributed organization, leading well requires <strong>intentional communication</strong>. Intentional communication requires the effective, consistent use of digital tools. To achieve this:</p>



<ul><li>take an inventory of the communication tools in use,</li><li>crowd source and align on the specific <strong>tools you are going to use</strong> and <strong>how you’re going to use them</strong>,</li><li>write <strong>patterns</strong>, <strong>anti-patterns</strong>, and <strong>starting points</strong> for each–make norms explicit by writing them down,</li><li>share them widely, and finally,</li><li>revise them often to keep them useful.</li></ul>



<p>One last thing. Communication is good, but <strong>too much communication is not a healthy signal</strong>. People need time to think, plan and work. They should not be thrashing endlessly between Slack, Jira and Docs. So make sure that people know how to protect their time and are able to set boundaries, get work done, and feel as though they are accomplishing things.</p>

                <p>Module documentation is an entry point for Ansible playbook authors. So it is
vitally important that we keep the said documentation in sync with the module
implementation or risk getting angry bug reports. But here lies the problem.</p>
<p>Maintaining the synchronization between documentation and implementation is not
as straightforward as it could be. Why? Because each Ansible module contains
two copies of parameter-related information. Module maintainers must first
document each module parameter and then copy a slightly transformed description
into the parameter validator.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no way to remove the information duplication from the
Ansible modules. So we decided to do the next best thing: automate the heck out
of the copy-to-the-validator part. Laziness for the win ;)</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-note-on-terminology">A quick note on terminology</h2>
<p>Arguments, options, and parameters in this post all have the same meaning. They
represent the data that the Ansible playbook author passes to the Ansible
module.</p>
<p>So why use different words to describe the same thing? Because the rendered
Ansible documentation uses the name parameters, the documentation block in
Ansible modules uses options, and validation-related code calls them arguments.
Because why not ;)</p>
<h2 id="where-does-it-go-wrong">Where does it go wrong</h2>
<p>Each Ansible module is composed of <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html" title="Module format and documetation">different sections</a>, but today we
are only interested in two of them: the [documentation block][doc] and the
<code>AnsibleModule</code> instantiation.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-block">Documentation block</h3>
<p>The documentation section is an inlined <a href="https://yaml.org/" title="YAML standard's home page">YAML</a> document that, among other
things, also contains an <em>options</em> key where all module parameter descriptions
live. For example, this is how we would describe options for a simple module:</p>
<pre><code>DOCUMENTATION = """
module: some.awesome.thing
short_description: Manage resources
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Resource name.
    type: str
    required: true
  state:
    description:
      - Resource's desired state.
    type: str
    choices: [ present, absent ]
    default: present
"""
</code></pre>
<p>If we were to render the previous parameter description into HTML, we would get
back a table row similar to this one:</p>
<figure>
  
  <img src="https://steampunk.si/blog/ansible-module-documentation-and-compliance/params.png" alt="The parameter documentation screengrab.">

    <p>
      The parameter documentation screengrab.
      
    </p>
    
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>And people who prefer the terminal over web browsers (hello brothers and
sisters) can use the <code>ansible-doc</code> utility to print this information to
console.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, Ansible playbook authors would first read the API
documentation and then write a task without making any mistakes. But
unfortunately, we live in a world where mistakes do happen, and most people
only read the documentation when something goes wrong. And it is hard to blame
them for that because let us face it: most of the documentation that we,
developers, write is crap ;)</p>
<h3 id="ansiblemodule-instantiation"><code>AnsibleModule</code> instantiation</h3>
<p>Because we want to catch at least some mistakes in Ansible playbooks, Ansible
modules validate their parameters. For our sample options from the
documentation example above, we would instantiate <code>AnsibleModule</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    argument_spec = dict(
        name=dict(
            type="str", required=True,
        ),
        state=dict(
            type="str", default="present", choices=["present", "absent"],
        ),
    )

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=argument_spec,
    )
</code></pre>
<p>And just like that, we duplicated some of the information, broke the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" title="Wikipedia's page on the DRY principle">DRY
principle</a>, and set ourselves on a path of documentation and validation
desynchronization.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-duplication---the-ansible-way">Dealing with duplication - the Ansible way</h2>
<p>So, how is Ansible currently dealing with the problem of information
duplication? In short, it does not. What Ansible does offer is a way of
detecting the desynchronization between the two copies of information.</p>
<p><strong>The <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing_validate-modules.html" title="Documentation for the validate-modules sanity test">validate-modules</a> sanity test will report the discrepancies between
the API documentation and argument specification, but we still need to resolve
them manually.</strong> For example, if we would change the default value for the
state parameter to <code>absent</code> in the argument specification, Ansible’s sanity
test would report back with this error:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-test sanity --requirements --test validate-modules
ERROR: plugins/modules/thing.py:0:0: doc-default-does-not-match-spec:
    Argument 'state' in argument_spec defines default as ('absent') but
    documentation defines default as ('present')
</code></pre>
<p>This detect-and-fix approach works pretty well if we are working with existing
Ansible modules. Parameter changes are usually small in such scenarios, which
keeps the error message count low. But things start to go downhill if we are
writing new Ansible modules. In cases where the Ansible module contains a
non-trivial amount of parameters, we can <strong>quickly end up with hundreds of
errors</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-argument-specification-generator">Introducing argument specification generator</h2>
<p>Since we are adding new modules to existing Ansible collections quite often, we
spend a considerable fraction of development time dealing with the initial
desynchronization of information.</p>
<p>That prompted us to develop <strong>the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ansible-argspec-gen/" title="Argument generator tool's PyPI listing">ansible-argspec-gen</a> tool that will
generate argument specification directly from the module documentation</strong>. And
yes, developers should not be allowed to name things ;)</p>
<p>Here is how the <code>ansible-argspec-gen</code> tool works:</p>
<ol>
<li>it starts by extracting the Ansible module’s documentation,</li>
<li>then, it generates the argument specification from the extracted documentation,</li>
<li>and finally, it updates the module’s source code between the markers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us see how this would work on our sample module. Once we add markers to the
module’s source code, we will end up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    # AUTOMATIC MODULE ARGUMENTS
    argument_spec = dict(
        name=dict(
            type="str", required=True,
        ),
        state=dict(
            type="str", default="present", choices=["present", "absent"],
        ),
    )
    # AUTOMATIC MODULE ARGUMENTS

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=argument_spec,
    )
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we are using a default marker text in our example, but you can
customize it via the <code>--marker</code> argument. Now we are ready to run the
generator:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-argspec-gen sample.py 
</code></pre>
<p>Once the previous command terminates, our module will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    # AUTOMATIC MODULE ARGUMENTS
    argument_spec = {
        "name": {"required": True, "type": "str"},
        "state": {
            "choices": ["present", "absent"],
            "default": "present",
            "type": "str",
        },
    }
    # AUTOMATIC MODULE ARGUMENTS

    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=argument_spec,
    )
</code></pre>
<p>Magic ;) But there is more. If we supply the <code>--diff</code> switch to the tool, it
will also print the module changes to the console:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-argspec-gen --diff sample.py 
--- sample.py.old
+++ sample.py.new

<p>The return code of the program indicates what happened during the run:</p>

<li><code>0</code> means that nothing changed.</li>
<li><code>1</code> means that the tool updated at least one module.</li>
<li><code>2</code> means that an error occurred during the execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>And what we get if we combine the status code with the <code>--dry-run</code> switch? A
check for our continuous integration pipeline that makes sure developers do not
forget to run the tool. You are welcome ;)</p>
<p>The tool can do a few other tricks, like extracting various constraints from
the documentation. But we will leave this information for another post. In the
mean time, you can play with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/tadeboro/f670939e8f24e204a42ab12fec701ca6" title="Sample module implementation gist">sample module</a> that we put into a GitHub
gist.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-you-start">Where can you start</h2>
<p>The proper way of solving the issue at hand would be to remove the duplication
from the code. But this is not entirely trivial to implement since the
information from <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#documentation-fragments" title="Documentation fragments description">documentation fragments</a> is not available to modules
at runtime.</p>
<p>Thus, no matter how ugly the argument specification generator may look at first
sight, it is currently the best weapon against information desynchronization.</p>

Whether it’s a charcoal grill or a <a href="https://www.grillcookbake.com/outdoor-cooking/gas-grills/" data-wpel-link="internal">gas grill</a>, there’s nothing like firing it up and grilling up your favorite food. Whether it’s just for you, for your family, or a group (social distancing, of course), grilled food is a crowd pleaser.</p><p>But just what exactly are the favorite grilled foods of Americans? We decided to find out. We surveyed over 3,900 Americans and asked them questions about their favorite foods and how they like them to be cooked. Read on to see our full results.&nbsp;</p><h2>Americans’ Favorite Grilled Food</h2><p>One of the first questions we asked was on respondent’s favorite grilled food. We offered a selection of seven classic options and threw in pineapple as an eighth.

    <p>This is the guide through the observability space to assist you with planning observability of your next project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Observability</strong> is ability of your system to expose data about its performance and behavior so we can further monitor, analyze and alert on certain trends or changes. Making your system observable requires certain effort in your project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care</h2>

<p><img src="https://rastko.tech/images/observability1_1.jpg"></p>

<p>Observability of your system is the <strong>top non-functional requirement</strong>. In my opinion, not even application performance tops observability. It is absolutely necessary that you know what is happening in your system at any given time and <strong>in level of detail necessary to be able to keep everything running smoothly by adequately reacting to change in te system</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, there is a possibility that you do not share this opinion, in which case you would,probably, rather develop your product, do a bit of testing, UAT and push it out. Probably because it requires certain amount of work and is considered non essential as you start. If Google Analytics is all you need, I am not here to argue that, refer back here when you change your mind. If, however, you want to dive into this topic and start planning, I want to share some insights that should help you pin down stuff that is most important for you and prioritize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are quite a few aspects of observability in service oriented architecture, and in this article I will be focusing on discussing every aspect with little bit of depth in order to help you better understand, focus and plan developing your observability. To help you plan and have a broader conversation with all the people involved in planning your project, I will provide some insight into most popular stacks as well and give insights into most important defining factors.</p>

<p>Your system being observable can mean multiple things on as many levels, but generally, it means that system exposes data that we can consume to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monitor system in real time.</li>
  <li>Alert or perform some automated task based on defined data state, or rather a change of state.</li>
  <li>Analyze and predict behaviors, requirements etc…</li>
  <li>Do a detailed analysis of the incident or any distinct event in the system.</li>
  <li>Any combination of above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it is all about using proper tools, let’s spend some time on quick discussion about what we need and what tool/type of observability we choose.</p>

<h2 id="characterizing-capabilities">Characterizing capabilities</h2>

<p>When we talk observability of the system, way we are planning it really depends on what we want to achieve. Ultimately, we would love to achieve everything, but some ability to focus and plan would be nice. Let us take a look at some factors to take into account when prioritizing observability.</p>

<p><strong>Main types of data:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Logs</strong> - Old, but gold. First that ever existed, has all the data about what is going on, but slow, hard to process and needs huge system throughput to bring usage close to real time. You can still go to the file that was generated last and grep it for particular phrase or just look for the time when error happened, which will forever be my favorite thin I ever learned how to do (apart from making pizza from scratch).</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> - Quick, flexible, made for quick availability and low throughput requirement, easy and long retention. Not too much data per unit of information, real time trend analysis and reaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Traces</strong> - Everything you would like to know about call you made, seems like magic especially in well instrumented distributed system. Sometimes slower then logs, but allows for deeper analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Performance qualities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usability</strong> - Do metrics allow a good way to monitor and analyze them, with flexibility in data architecture to give enough versatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed/throughput requirements</strong> - how much metrics system can take before receiving some performance penalty. Also, how fast are the metrics available for consumption/use (both manual and automated).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Way we plan to consume data:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - real time plotting and observation of system state.</li>
  <li><strong>Alerting and automatic triggers</strong> - reacting to events by broadcasting notification or triggering events.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics</strong> - analyzing collected data to gather useful learnings about system and/or perform <strong>root cause analysis (RCA)</strong> of problem in the past (usual case) or ongoing problem (more rare since Analytics is mostly about applying complex algorithms to big data sets to draw conclusions, and that takes time).</li>
</ul>

<p>We can quickly draft a following table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Performance/ Throughput needs</th>
      <th>Recommended for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Logs</td>
      <td>Medium / Medium - still lots of text</td>
      <td>RCA/Monitoring/Alerting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Metrics</td>
      <td>Fast / Low - smallest unit of data</td>
      <td>Monitoring/Alerting/Analytics</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Traces</td>
      <td>Slow / High - contains lots of data</td>
      <td>RCA, Alerting in some setups</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="creating-observability">Creating observability</h2>

<p>As you are building a system, no matter if it is a huge monolithic application, or a multiservice-something, planning observability you want to achieve will get you places. For that you’ll have to know what kind of tools you need and what additional infrastructure will it take… of course, but there is also a choice of where to start. It is less obvious, but deciding to do everything might be costly decision depending on how much time you got to deliver first version of your system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DevOps</strong> - in this moment it is worth mentioning that for most of the stuff that I write, I assume your goal is full DevOps, and that your team is building everything and running it in all the environments. If you are getting something pre built, you have army of engineers or reasonably long timelines there might be a way to get it all in time .</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Generally, you do not need to do anything in order for your system to start gathering logs, logs will be available to you anywhere from default log directory for the OS of choice to Kubernetes logs. What you will need is everything else - literally.</p>

<p>Going from just a stack of call logs inside a gazillion line file on disc to searchable log database that can also be used for certain level of alerting and many different applications is the matter of planning. I usually recommend two well known stacks, that differ in log collection segment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">ELK</a> - Elastic, Logstash, Kibana which is more standard one</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-elasticsearch-fluentd-and-kibana-efk-logging-stack-on-kubernetes">EFK</a>- Elastic, Fluentd, Kibana which is more flexible one in terms of data flow management and further design scalability. It is also recommended for Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess everyone loves 3-letter abbreviations so nobody bothered to add F at start of both, since it became a standard. F for <a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to setup EXK and Filebeat, Filebeat will pick up the logs as they arrive to any of mentioned standard log outputs and send them to log collector, that gets stored into Elastic database so logs will be indexed and made searchable and visualizable through Kibana.</p>

<p>Obviously, more activity you got in your system, more logs there is, more data throughput becomes crucial for your logs to get to you - Filebeat needs to send logs to Elastic that then needs to index them (on the way there is a throughput of whatever you use). I have seen cases of hundreds of terrabytes of logs a day with need of month to 3 months retention… It becomes whole separate system to maintain.</p>

<p>The good thing is that, when overwhelmed, these setups are quite good in the degrading performance but keeping data, so if you do not run out of physical hardware and everything just halts, your logs may be late to Kibana because elastic can’t index, or they might be stuck in some queue, but they will not be lost. That is, at least, something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In the wild</strong></p>

  <p>Stack itself is relatively easy to deploy with lots of resources available online, from tutorials to docker-composed sets, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> submodules and<a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> charts to do it for you. First hard thing to do is set everything right first time from the delivery of logs perspective. Second hard thing to do is not to kill your logging stack with too much or too big logs.</p>

  <p>Good luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p><img src="https://rastko.tech/images/observability1_3.jpg"></p>

<p>On the metrics side of things are lot different then on the logs side of things - although there is general majority choice of a tool, and thus a approach to it, there are actually two different approaches based on a way metrics are exposed / collected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull - used by wider accepted and <a href="https://www.cncf.io/cncf-prometheus-project-journey/">CNCF adopted Prometheus</a></li>
  <li>Push - used by StatsD</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on two stand out representatives of two groups, I will provide quick comparison.</p>

<h4 id="pull---prometheus">Pull - Prometheus</h4>

<p><a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> is my current metrics collection stack of choice, developed by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> and fully promoted ot open source in 2015, although it was available for longer.</p>

<p>Pull means that metrics collector is scraping services that are being monitored by it. In turn, system requires that any service that needs to be monitored by Prometheus exposes metrics. Data exposition format allows “condensation” of the metrics that are exposed, so they basically can accumulate until scraped for both variable scraping intervals, but also the longer periods in case of incidents with collector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metrics are kept in service’s memory until collector pulls (scrapes) the metrics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The architecture of the metrics collection and way Prometheus is built gives us two important architectural advantages:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will discuss regular expression quantifiers with the ultimate goal of developing a very deep understanding of how they work. &nbsp;In fact, by the end of this article you'll understand quantifiers so well, that you'll be able to extend your knowledge to invent a completely new quantifier has never been seen before in any regular expression engine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantifiers are used to quantify how many times a part of your regular expression should be repeated. &nbsp;Every time you want to repeat something in a regex (an individual character, a character class or a sub-expression) you can write a quantifier after it to specify how many times it should be repeated.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following list shows some examples of the most common quantifiers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>*</strong></li>
<li><strong>+</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{,N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,M}</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article will only discuss these quantifiers within the context of Perl-like regular expressions (<em>not</em> POSIX regular expressions). &nbsp;This is worth mentioning since the older POSIX style regular expression quantifiers lack certain features, and have significantly different behaviour in some cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most typical guides to regular expressions would probably start by immediately diving into a detailed description of what each of these symbols does. &nbsp;They would probably start by explaining the meaning of the '*', '+', and '?' symbols. &nbsp;However, <em><strong>this won't be your typical guide to regular expressions</strong></em>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we'll start by focusing on understanding this quantifier:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this atypical approach is simple: &nbsp;Once you understand what <em>this</em> quantifier does, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;Let's do a few examples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume you need to write a regular expression that can match both spellings of the word 'enroll'. &nbsp;The word 'enroll' can sometimes be spelled with one 'l' or two 'l's depending on whether the author chooses to use British or American spelling conventions. &nbsp;Using this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll be able to match both spellings of 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a link to an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=enrol%7B1%2C2%7D">interactive visualization of the regex enrol{1,2}</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the quantifier is the '{1,2}' part. &nbsp;The '{1,2}' quantifier can be interpreted in English to mean "Whatever came just before this quantifier, repeated anywhere from 1 to 2 times.". &nbsp;If you wanted to change the regex to also match any misspellings of 'enroll' that have 3 'l's, you could just change the upper bound of the range from 2 to 3:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, using the regex above, you can match all three spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could go even further and change the regex to include misspellings that don't have any 'l's at all, by decreasing the lower bound of the range 0:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{0,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the regex above, you can match these four (miss)spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enro</li>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern that this quantifier uses should now be a bit more obvious: &nbsp;Whenever we want specify that the previous character can be repeated a lower bound of N times up to an upper bound of M times, we can write this quantifier after the character:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the letters 'N' and 'M' here are placeholders that are used for the purposes of documentation. &nbsp;In reality, you would never literally write '{N,M}' as a quantifier in your regular expression. &nbsp;You would would write something like '{2,8}', '{0,20}' or any other pair of positive integers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make things crystal clear, there are a few cases where the endpoints of the range are not explicitly written, but are instead implied. &nbsp;Here is an example:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of this quantifier is to repeat the character 'a' anywhere from (it doesn't matter times) to 5 times. &nbsp;Another way to describe the same thing would be to say "repeat the character 'a' anywhere from 0 times to 5 times" which you could do with the following equivalent regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll sometimes see the same thing with the upper bound of the range:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in these cases the upper end of the range is assumed to be "Infinity", however there is no equivalent way to write this explicitly. &nbsp;You simply can't write something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,Infinity} (This does not work)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since most regex engines will default to interpreting the range quantifier as literal text if it doesn't see the format it expects. &nbsp;Therefore, when the upper bound of your range is 'infinity', you must simply omit the second number like this: '{3,}'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final important case to consider is when a single number is used to describe that the previous character should be matched <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified. &nbsp;For example, this regex will match any sequence of <em>exactly</em> 4 'a' characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted to re-write this using a range, we could write:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4,4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which means the same thing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the quantifiers we've reviewed so far, it should be clear that they can all be re-written in the following standardized form:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where</p>

<ul>
	<li>'N' is a positive integer.</li>
	<li>'M' is a positive integer OR left blank to represent 'infinity'.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still haven't discussed the meaning of the '?', '*' and '+' quantifiers, so let's do that now:</p>

<ul>
	<li>'<strong>?</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,1}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>*</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>+</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{1,}</strong>'.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%3F&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '?' quantifier</a> that makes the character 'a' optional. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph splits into two possible paths: &nbsp;One that skips the character 'a', and one that requires it. &nbsp;If one path fails, the regular expression engine simply backtracks to try the other path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%2B&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '+' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' one or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by requiring an 'a' character. &nbsp;If there are no 'a' characters, it fails immediately. &nbsp;If there is at least one, control will split into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path goes back to try and get yet another 'a' character, and the other continues with the rest of the regex. &nbsp;By default, the regex engine will first try the path that consumes yet another 'a' character until there are no more in the search text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a*&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '*' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' zero or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by splitting into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path immediately continues on with the rest of the regex, and the other attempts to consume an 'a' character. &nbsp;By default, this quantifier will first try the path that consumes an 'a' character. &nbsp;Once it fails to find another 'a' character, it will give up and continue on with the rest of the regex.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a table to summarize what we've learned so far:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Quantifier Symbol</td><td>Normalized As A Range</td><td>What It Really Means</td></tr>
		<tr><td>?</td><td>{0,1}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to 1 times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>*</td><td>{0,}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>+</td><td>{1,}</td><td>"Repeated from 1 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N}</td><td>{N,N}</td><td>"Repeated from N to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{,N}</td><td>{0,N}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,}</td><td>{N,}</td><td>"Repeated from N to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,M}</td><td>{N,M}</td><td>"Repeated from N to M times."</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed previously, quantifiers can be used to specify how many times a character in your regular expression can be repeated:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you can also apply quantifiers to character classes too:</p>

<p><code><pre>[0-9]{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you could use this regular expression to match chapter titles in a book, regardless of how many digits are in the chapter number:</p>

<p><code><pre>[Cc]hapter [0-9]+
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most importantly, you can also apply a quantifier to a sub-expression to repeat a sequence of characters. &nbsp;For example this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(Hello){2,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHelloHello</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even apply quantifiers to a sub-expression that contains an alternation. &nbsp;This regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(cat|dog|bird){1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cat</li>
	<li>dog</li>
	<li>bird</li>
	<li>catcat</li>
	<li>catdog</li>
	<li>catbird</li>
	<li>dogcat</li>
	<li>dogdog</li>
	<li>dogbird</li>
	<li>birdcat</li>
	<li>birddog</li>
	<li>birdbird</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as promised earlier, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;There are many more quantifiers than what we've seen so far, but fortunately, there are only 4 fundamental aspects to every regular expression quantifier, and you'll understand them all by the end of this article. &nbsp;Here are those 4 aspects:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1)  The minimum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>2)  The maximum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li>3)  Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.</li>
	<li>4)  Whether it will disable backtracking or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you can see, we've already covered the first two, so 2/4 = 50% done.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's cover item #3 from the list above: "Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.". &nbsp;Consider a case where we want to match this regular expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{2,4}(aabbcc|bb)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against this piece of text:</p>

<p><code><pre>aaaabbcc
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can follow through the matching process with an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%7B2%2C4%7D(aabbcc%7Cbb)&amp;the_subject=aaaabbcc">interactive visualization of the matching process for this regex here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the quantifier '{2,4}' can match the 'a' anywhere from 2 times to 4 times, and the text we're searching starts with 4 consecutive 'a's, it's ok for the regular …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/proxmox-terraform-cloudinit-saltstack-prometheus/">last post</a> I covered deploying Linux-based Proxmox instances using Terraform, leveraging <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">Cloud-Init</a> and <code>cloud-config</code> to register these instances with SaltStack.</p>
<p>The instances in the previous post were both Linux distributions (Debian and Fedora). This is because Cloud-Init was initially built for Linux, and then ported to other Unix-like systems (eg FreeBSD, OpenBSD and more).</p>
<p>Thanks to a company called <a href="https://cloudbase.it/">Cloudbase Solutions</a> an equivalent of Cloud-Init is also available for Windows, known as <a href="https://cloudbase.it/cloudbase-init/">Cloudbase-Init</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cloudbase-init">Cloudbase-Init</h2>
<p>Cloudbase-Init is written in Python, and was originally developed to allow customization of Windows images on OpenStack. However it also supports a number of different <a href="https://cloudbase-init.readthedocs.io/en/latest/services.html">metadata services</a> (everything from AWS and Azure to VMware).</p>
<p>Cloudbase-Init also supports a <a href="https://cloudbase-init.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userdata.html#cloud-config">subset</a> of the <code>cloud-config</code> format, including <code>write_files</code> (i.e. creating files on the instance), <code>users</code>, <code>groups</code>, <code>runcmd</code> (i.e. running arbitrary commands) and more.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-the-template-machine">Preparing the template machine</h2>
<p>The first step before creating your instances is to create a template Windows image. This image can then be used as a base image for other instances (using cloning).</p>
<p>Cloudbase Solutions provide <a href="https://github.com/cloudbase/windows-openstack-imaging-tools">tools</a> to build Windows images ready to be deployed with Cloudbase-Init installed, but they rely on Hyper-V on Windows. If you do not have access to a Windows machine to generate the images, do not have access to Hyper-V, or simply want to go through the process yourself, then you can install Cloudbase-Init in a Windows instance yourself.</p>
<h3 id="installing-windows">Installing Windows</h3>
<p>In this post, I am using Windows Server Core 2019 (i.e. without the Desktop Experience installed). As Proxmox uses KVM as its underlying hypervisor, you will also need to download the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-windows-virtual-machines-using-virtio-drivers/index.html">VirtIO-Win</a> ISO. This contains all the necessary drivers for Windows for VirtIO-based NICs, storage and serial devices. Without this, you would need use emulated devices (i.e. emulated SATA or network devices), which are less efficient than the VirtIO equivalents.</p>
<p>First, download the VirtIO ISO and place it in the <code>/var/lib/vz/templates/iso</code> directory on your Proxmox host. This is where Proxmox expects to find all ISO images by default.</p>
<p>After this, place the ISO for your Windows version of choice in the same directory. If you already have the ISOs, then use something like <code>scp</code> or <code>rsync</code> to place it on the Proxmox server. Alternatively, you can dowload trial versions of Windows from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/">Microsoft Evaluation Center</a>. These trial versions can be activated later with the appropriate license key and service contract with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Now create the instance. The settings in the below images should work on a default Proxmox install, but you may need to change them if your environment differs (eg using Ceph/ZFS for storage, OpenVSwitch for networking): -</p>
<p><strong>Create the VM</strong>

<p><strong>Choose the network</strong>
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-create-vm-8-network.png" alt="proxmox win create vm network"></p>
<p>After creating the instance, select it, go to <strong>Hardware</strong>, and then add a CD-ROM drive: -
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-create-vm-9-add-cdrom.png" alt="proxmox win create vm add cdrom"></p>
<p>Choose the <strong>virtio-win.iso</strong> - this contains all the necessary Windows drivers: -
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-create-vm-10-virtio.png" alt="proxmox win create vm virtio"></p>
<p>When you start the machine, you should now be presented with the following: -</p>
<p><strong>Loading files</strong>
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-1-loading-files.png" alt="Proxmox Windows - Loading Files"></p>
<p><strong>Booting</strong>

<p><strong>Click Install Now</strong>
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-4-install.png" alt="proxmox win install vm install"></p>
<p><strong>Choose which version (Desktop Experience = GUI)</strong>
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-5-win-version.png" alt="proxmox win install vm win version"></p>
<p><strong>Choose Custom installation (because there is no existing installation to upgrade)</strong>
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-6-custom.png" alt="proxmox win install vm custom"></p>
<p>At this point, you will see that there is no hard disk to install to. This is because Windows does not include the VirtIO drivers by default: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-7-no-disk.png" alt="proxmox win install vm no disk"></p>
<p>We can resolve this by clicking on <strong>Load Driver</strong>, which will give the option to <strong>browse</strong> for drivers: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-8-browse.png" alt="proxmox win install vm browse"></p>
<p>Navigate to the driver with the <strong>virtio-win-0.x.x</strong> ISO: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-8-virtio-cd.png" alt="proxmox win install vm virtio cd"></p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>viostor</strong>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-9-viostor.png" alt="proxmox win install vm viostor"></p>
<p>Select the driver and click on <strong>Next</strong>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-10-select-driver.png" alt="proxmox win install vm select driver"></p>
<p>You should now see the disk to install to: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-11-disk.png" alt="proxmox win install vm disk"></p>
<p>At this point, you can either click <strong>Next</strong> and finish the installation, or you can click <strong>Load Driver</strong> to add more VirtIO drivers. The main ones to install are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Balloon - This allows for dynamic memory management, optimizing memory usage where appropriate</li>
<li>NetKVM - This installs the network drivers for the VirtIO network card</li>
<li>qxldod - If you require graphics drivers</li>
<li>vioserial - This installs serial drivers, which we will need to use later for Cloudbase-Init (mainly for logging)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to install the drivers later, using either the GUI if you chose the desktop experience, or using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/pnputil">pnputil</a> if using Server Core.</p>
<p>Once done, click <strong>Next</strong> to finish the installation: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-12-copying.png" alt="Proxmox Windows Install - Copying Files"></p>
<p>Once Windows is installed and restarted, you will be given the option to create a password for the Administrator user: -</p>
<p><strong>Unlock the instance (using Ctrl, Alt and Delete</strong>
<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-13-unlock.png" alt="proxmox win install vm unlock"></p>
<p><strong>Proxmox Ctrl, Alt and Delete in NoVNC</strong>

<img src="https://yetiops.net/img/proxmox/proxmox-win-install-vm-17-cmd-prompt.png" alt="proxmox win install vm cmd prompt"></p>
<p>At this point, we are now ready to customize the image.</p>
<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
<p>To prepare the image, the minimum we require for Cloud-Init is the Cloudbase-Init utility. Before installing Cloudbase-Init I also do the following: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Install OpenSSH Server for remote management</li>
<li>Install Salt</li>
<li>Disable the firewall and enable RDP</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for disabling the firewall is that in the environments I work in, host-based firewalls are not used. Instead, they are managed either via network firewalls or via security groups (if used within a cloud provider). If you require the firewall to be enabled, then you will need to customize the firewall rules to match your environment.</p>
<h4 id="installing-openssh-server">Installing OpenSSH Server</h4>
<p>To install the OpenSSH Server on Windows 2019, you can follow the steps in <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-saltstack-part-2-windows/#enabling-openssh-on-windows">this post</a>. We are then able to SSH into the machine: -</p>
<h4 id="install-salt">Install Salt</h4>
<p>To install the Salt Minion, again you can follow the steps in <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-saltstack-part-2-windows/#installing-the-salt-minion">this post</a>. However, do not follow the steps for updating the minion configuration post-install. The minion configuration will be customized by Cloudbase-Init based upon the provided User Data.</p>
<h4 id="disable-the-firewall-and-enable-rdp">Disable the firewall and enable RDP</h4>
<p>While most tasks can be completed using Powershell in Windows Core, there is no inbuilt text editor. You can either install something like <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">ViM</a> or you can use RDP so that <code>notepad.exe</code> is available for file editing.</p>
<p>We also disable the firewall at this point, as otherwise we will need to add an RDP-specific rule to the firewall to allow us to access the machine.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># Disable the firewall</span>
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled false

<span># Enable RDP</span>
Set-ItemProperty -Path <span>'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server'</span> -name <span>"fDenyTSConnections"</span> -value 0
</code></pre></div><p>You can also use the <code>sconfig</code> tool to enable RDP as well: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">PS C:<span>\U</span>sers<span>\A</span>dministrator&gt; sconfig

<p>To install Cloudbase-Init, go to the <a href="https://cloudbase.it/cloudbase-init/">Cloudbase-Init product page</a>, scroll down to Downloads, and choose the version appropriate for your environment. I am running Windows 2019 on a 64-bit x86 processor, so I chose the <strong>Stable Cloudbase-init x64</strong> version.</p>
<p>The following steps will download and then install Cloudbase-Init: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># Download the file</span>
PS C:\Users\Administrator&gt; Invoke-WebRequest -uri https<span>:</span>//cloudbase.it/downloads/CloudbaseInitSetup_Stable_x64.msi -outfile cloudbase-init.msi

<span># Install the MSI file non-interactively</span>
PS C:\Users\Administrator&gt; msiexec /i cloudbase-init.msi /qn /l*v log.txt
</code></pre></div><p>You can install Cloudbase-Init interactively and follow the on-screen instructions to customize the configuration. However we will need to change some options within the Cloudbase-Init configuration anyway, so there is little to benefit in using the GUI installer to configure the Cloudbase-Init service.</p>
<p>We can check that it is installed using: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell">PS C:\Users\Administrator&gt; Get-Service cloudbase-init

Status   Name               DisplayName

Stopped  cloudbase-init     cloudbase-init
</code></pre></div><h3 id="configuring-cloudbase-init">Configuring Cloudbase-Init</h3>
<p>The default configuration files for Cloudbase-Init enable a number of different metadata services, most of which are not applicable to Proxmox.</p>
<p>We also need to enable the <code>User-Data</code> plugin otherwise Cloudbase-Init will not be able access any configuration we provide via Cloud-Init. The User Data can be in the form of Batch scripts (i.e. <code>cmd.exe</code>), Powershell, BASH (if it is installed natively under Windows), Python and <code>cloud-config</code>.</p>
<p>The following configuration files tell Cloudbase-Init to use the ConfigDrive2 format for user-data (the default format for a Windows guest on Proxmox), and enables the plugins required to make changes to the network, files and source changes from user-data: -</p>

</h3><p>
(See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24363273">HN thread</a> here.)</p><p>

Once every while I read something that changes my perspective on things. Usually, not because it reveals a ground-breaking truth, but because it helps me connect the dots backward. Suddenly, things are now integral parts of a larger picture and everything makes more sense.</p><p>

A year ago I read this piece from Eugene Wei: <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service" target="_blank">Status as a Service</a>.</p><p>

Eugene writes:</p><blockquote>
Why does proof of work matter for a social network? If people want to maximize social capital, why not make that as easy as possible? As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans. Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.</blockquote><p>
He continues:</p><blockquote>
Read Twitter today and hardly any of the tweets are the mundane life updates of its awkward pre-puberty years. We are now in late-stage performative Twitter, where nearly every tweet is hungry as hell for favorites and retweets, and everyone is a trained pundit or comedian. It's hot takes and cool proverbs all the way down. The harmless status update Twitter was a less thirsty scene but also not much of a business. Still, sometimes I miss the halcyon days when not every tweet was a thirst trap. I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye, the always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye, I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye.</blockquote><p>
Then, goes:</p><blockquote>
So, to answer an earlier question about how a new social network takes hold, let’s add this: a new Status as a Service business must devise some proof of work that depends on some actual skill to differentiate among users. If it does, then it creates, like an ICO, some new form of social capital currency of value to those users.</blockquote>
<p>
This didn't just resonate with me. It helped me understand on a deeper level how and why visual arts, aesthetics, music, and human taste in general develop.</p><p>

Let’s start from the ground up.</p><p>

In a few words, the article states that:</p><ul>
<li>Social Networks to thrive need a <i>proof of concept</i></li>
<li>Prohibitions spark human creativity in a newly formed area</li>
<li>Humans, then, leverage that creativity to attract social capital and compete against each other in the newly formed arena</li>
</ul><p>
Over a long enough timeline, all the social capital available in a certain system gets allocated.</p><p>

The more we understand a system, the more effective we are at allocating social capital in it. Hence, we need new restrictions to unlock new human creativity and feed new social capital back into the system.</p><p>

This can explain on some levels how Social Networks develops, but I wondered what else? Are there are other fields where this theory applies just as well?</p><h3>
1. Painting: Cubism</h3>
<p>
For centuries, visual arts was one of the major arenas where human intellects competed. For centuries, humans challenged each other by representing reality through mere copies of the same instance.</p><p>

And gradually, we were able to go from this..</p><p>

<img alt="La pinacoteca del deserto | Wall Street International Magazine" src="https://media.wsimag.com/attachments/b875394fe3e10f195aaf936aedab87d5379b5f93/store/fill/930/523/d201b041400d593bd503ef96371789c31f312481cfd248f0a901c5876477/Pitture-rupestri-di-Jabbaren-nominate-le-libere-donne-di-Jabbaren.jpg"></p><p>

To this:</p><p>

<img alt="Frederic Edwin Church | Biography, Art, &amp; Facts | Britannica" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/88/69588-050-87EF851C/View-Cotopaxi-oil-canvas-Frederic-Edwin-Church-1857.jpg"></p><p>

Connects the dots and see how linear was the progression in the aesthetic. Over time, humans became quite extraordinary at this exercise.</p><p>

Renaissance, impressionism, pointillism, abstract expressionism, realism, etc, were all micro-steps part of the same bigger effort: representing the reality for what it is.</p><p>

Social capital in that area was progressively getting allocated up to the point where there was no much left to. Over centuries of incremental progress, we got the point where we mastered the <i>proof of work</i>.</p><p>

So, we needed a radically new thing. A new greenfield and new proofs of concept.</p><p>

Introducing cubism.</p><p>

<img alt="Georges Braque 1882–1963 | Tate" src="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00445_9.jpg"></p><p>

Unlike any of the prior movements, cubisms challenged the fundamental rules, the basic assumptions upon which the system was constructed. Reality should be represented as<i>&nbsp;it is</i>.</p><p>

This new <i>proof of work</i> emphasized a flat, two-dimensional surface. It rejected the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, chiaroscuro, etc, and refuted time-honored theories of art as the imitation of nature.</p><p>

For the first time in history, painters were not bound to copying form, texture, color, space, etc. That was too well understood. They were called to present reality in radically fragmented objects, whose several sides were seen simultaneously.</p><p>

The movement was pioneered by Braque who made the original proof of concept but it was Picasso who really extracted much of the social capital that came out of it.</p><h3>
2. Music: Dodecaphony (or Twelve-tonic technique, or Chromaticism)</h3><p>
First, Bach, the real explorer of Classic composition.</p><p>

Then Mozart, and Beethoven.</p><p>

Then Chopin, Debussy, and Ravel.</p><p>

Different styles emerged across centuries (from Baroque to Late Romantic) but the ground rules in the classical composition didn’t really change.</p><p>

Let me explain.</p><p>

In traditional Western music, tonality is a means of organizing pitch in accordance with the physics of sound. A fundamental tone — say, C in a C major scale — is central; the other pitches relate to it in a hierarchy of importance based on natural overtone relationships. So, whatever happens, the music keeps returning to that fundamental tonal mooring.</p><p>

This is such a key aspect in music because it provides a sense of arrival and rest.</p><p>

All Western classical and pop music relies on the idea that, no matter what, we'll eventually get to "home base".</p><p>

Leveraging this musical axiom, musical composition techniques that had been prepared over centuries&nbsp;made it possible in the 18th century to write music that was original and immediately appealing but also sophisticated under the surface.</p><p>

And by the end of the 18th century, a lot of low-hanging fruit was picked and much of the social capital in the system was already allocated in the hands of few. There wasn't much left to discover.</p><p>

In 19th-century composers,&nbsp;Wagner, Mahler, Debussy, originality frequently came at the cost of greater surface complexity, and a less direct, cheerful tone.</p><p>

It was clear that humans needed new ground-up rules to compete.</p><p>

Schoenberg was one of the first to realize&nbsp;that new innovation could only be unlocked by re-thinking the ground-rules. So he invented a new<a href="http:/#" target="_blank">&nbsp;compositional technique:&nbsp;</a><a href="http:/#" target="_blank">twelve-tonic.</a></p><p>

<img alt="Arnold Schoenberg : Quartetto per Archi - Analisi Musicale" src="https://www.armoniamusicale.com/wp-content/uploads/Schoenberg-quartetto.jpg"></p><p>

Shoenberg's twelve tonic technique comes with no musical tonality. All 12 pitches of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music without emphasis on any specific note. In other words, all 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Consequentially, there can't home base.</p><p>

It was a radically new game.</p><p>

Shoenberg's new musical arena unlocked new social capital and many of the composers of the 20th century competed on those new rules.</p><p>

Several giants explored the 12-tone technique as well: not only Stravinsky, whose move into the enemy camp shook up the world of modern music but also Messiaen and Copland.</p><p>

Looking backward, we can say the invention of the 12-tone system was arguably the most audacious and influential development in 20th-century music.</p><h3>
3. Fashion: Kate Moss</h3>
<p>
The world of the 19th century was a world in which the canons of beauty were sculptured.</p><p>

Up to the point where the whole fashion scene was dominated by the same characters: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Sharon Stone, etc.</p><p>

That was a solved game.</p><p>

It was in that world, that <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10364017/Corinne-Day-the-woman-who-discovered-Kate-Moss.html" target="_blank">Corinne Day discovered a new way to represent beauty</a>.</p><p>

Not through the canonical blonde/long hair, nor the perfect-looking skin or the mesmerizing white of the teeth.</p><p>

C. Day used the cheeky expression of a 16yo suburban skinny girl named Kate Moss to show the world an entirely new idea of aesthetics.</p><p>

Way far from what were the conventions of the time.</p><p>

Not colorful, but black and white photos.<br>
Not sinuous, but skinny body forms.<br>
Not perfect-looking, but seemingly sloppy dresses.<br>
Not cheerful, but melancholic tones.</p><p>

<img alt="calvin klein kate moss Tiziano Magni kate-jam-and-diamonds •" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/0d7209dc40fe05243c9a9ea65b3da5b1/tumblr_n22mc1djTU1r9tciko1_500.jpg"></p><p>

It was a totally different game with totally different rules.</p><p>

The effects were immediate. Existing players were&nbsp;outplayed, new social capital was unlocked, and new icons emerged.</p><p>

Moss did to Campbell, what Braque did to Manet, and what Shoenberg did to centuries of Mozart.</p><p>

Centuries of slow but incremental linear development lost in a matter of a few years.</p><p>

Visual arts, philosophy, music, and many realms get periodically rearranged according to the same principles: when there’s no more Social Capital left on the table either because it eroded over centuries or because it was consolidated in the hands of just a few winners.</p><p>

After all, we're all are status-seeking monkeys seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"><p>React Hooks were introduced at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Conf October 2018</a> as a way to use state and side-effects (see lifecycle methods in class components) in React function components. Whereas function components have been called functional stateless components (FSC) before, they are finally able to use state with React Hooks and therefore many people refer to them as function components now.</p><p>In this walkthrough, I want to explain the motivation for React Hooks, what will change in React, and how React hooks can be used in function components by showcasing common React Hooks such as the state and effect Hooks by example. This tutorial is only an introduction to React Hooks. At the end of this tutorial, you will find many more tutorials to learn about React Hooks in depth.</p><h2 id="why-react-hooks"><a href="#why-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="why react hooks permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Why React Hooks?</h2><p>React Hooks were invented by the React team to introduce state management and side-effects in <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component">function components</a>. It's their way of making it more effortless to use only React function components without the need to refactor a React function component to a React class component for using lifecycle methods, in order to use have side-effects, or local state. React Hooks enable us to write React applications with only function components. Thus, there is no need to use class components anymore.</p><p><strong>Unnecessary Component Refactorings:</strong> Function components with React Hooks prevent unnecessary component refactorings. Previously, only React class components were used for local state management and lifecycle methods. The latter have been essential for introducing side-effects, such as listeners or data fetching, in React class components. The following shows a React class component with state management:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Component </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>super</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>You clicked </span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span> times</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          Click me</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> Counter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Only if you didn't need state or lifecycle methods, React functional <em>stateless</em> components could be used. And because React function components are more lightweight (and elegant), people already used plenty of function components. This came with the drawback of refactoring components from React function components to React class components every time state or lifecycle methods were needed (and vice versa). With Hooks there is no need for this refactoring. Side-effects and state are finally available in React function components. That's why a rebranding from functional stateless components to function components would be reasonable:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>count</span><span>,</span><span> setCount</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>You clicked </span><span>{</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span> times</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>count </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        Click me</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> Counter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p><strong>Side-effect Logic:</strong> In React class components, side-effects were mostly introduced in lifecycle methods (e.g. componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount). A side-effect could be <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data">fetching data in React</a> or <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-intersection-observer-api">interacting with the Browser API</a>. Usually these side-effects came with a setup and clean up phase. For instance, if you would miss to remove your listener, you could run into <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-warning-cant-call-setstate-on-an-unmounted-component">React performance issues</a>.</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyComponent</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>componentWillUnmount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, if you would introduce more than one of these side-effects in a React class component's lifecycle methods, all side-effects would be grouped by lifecycle method but not by side-effect. That's what React Hooks are going to change by encapsulating a side-effect in one hook whereas every hook has its own side-effect with a setup and clean up phase. You will see later in a tutorial how this works for real by adding and removing listeners in a React Hook.</p><p><strong>React's Abstraction Hell:</strong> Abstraction and thus reusability were introduced with <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-higher-order-components">Higher-Order Components</a> and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-render-props">Render Prop Components</a> in React. There is also <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context">React's Context with its Provider and Consumer Components</a> that introduce another level of abstraction. All of these advanced patterns in React are using so called wrapping components. The implementation of the following components shouldn't be foreign to developers who are creating larger React applications:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> compose</span><span>,</span><span> withReducer </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'recompose'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> withRouter </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react-router-dom'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> history</span><span>,</span><span> state</span><span>,</span><span> dispatch </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ThemeContext.Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Content</span><span> </span><span>theme</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>ThemeContext.Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>compose</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  withRouter</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>withReducer</span><span>(</span><span>reducer</span><span>,</span><span> initialState</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>App</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Sophie Alpert coined it "the wrapper hell" in React. You are not only seeing it in the implementation, but also when inspecting your components in the browser. There are dozens of wrapped components due to Render Prop Components (including Consumer components from React's Context) and Higher-Order Components. It becomes an unreadable component tree, because all the abstracted logic is covered up in other React components. The actual visible components are hard to track down in the browser's DOM. So what if these additional components were not needed because the logic is only encapsulated in functions as side-effects instead? Then you would remove all these wrapping components and flatten your component tree's structure:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useTheme </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'styled-components'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useRouter </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react-router-dom'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> theme </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useTheme</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> history </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useRouter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>,</span><span> dispatch</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span><span>(</span><span>reducer</span><span>,</span><span> initialState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Content</span><span> </span><span>theme</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> App</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>That's what React Hooks are bringing on the table. All side-effects are sitting directly in the component without introducing other components as container for business logic. The container disappears and the logic just sits in React Hooks that are only functions. Even <a href="https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/commit/7867de653abbb57a49934e52622a60b433bda918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Clark left a deprecation statement in favor of React Hooks in his popular Higher-Order Component library</a>.</p><p><strong>JavaScript Class Confusion:</strong> JavaScript mixes two worlds pretty well: Object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP). React introduces many developers to both worlds. On the one side, React (and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-javascript">Redux</a>) introduced people to functional programming (FP) with function compositions, general programming concepts with functions (e.g. higher-order functions, JavaScript built-in methods like map, reduce, filter) and other terms such as immutability and side-effects. React itself didn't really introduce these things, because they are features of the language or the programming paradigm itself, but they are heavily used in React whereas <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements">every React developer becomes automatically a better JavaScript developer</a>.</p><p>On the other side, React uses JavaScript classes as one way to define React components. A class is only the declaration whereas the actual usage of the component is the instantiation of it. It creates a class instance whereas the <code>this</code> object of the class instance is used to interact with class methods (e.g. setState, forceUpdate, other custom class methods). However, classes come with a steeper learning curve for JavaScript/React beginners who are not coming from an OOP background. That's why class bindings, the <code>this</code> object and inheritance (<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which should be avoided anyway</a>) can be confusing.</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>onIncrement</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      value</span><span>:</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>onDecrement</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      value</span><span>:</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>onIncrement</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>+</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>onDecrement</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, many people argue React shouldn't take JavaScript classes away because people don't understand them. After all, they belong to the language. However, one of the hypotheses of introducing React Hooks is a smoother learning curve for React beginners when writing their React components without JavaScript classes in the first place.</p><h3 id="exercises"><a href="#exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="exercises permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Exercises:</h3><ul><li>Read more about <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component">React Function Components</a>.</li><li>Read more about <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition">Composition in React</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="whats-different-with-react-hooks"><a href="#whats-different-with-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="whats different with react hooks permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>What's different with React Hooks?</h2><p>Every time a new feature is introduced, people are concerned about it. There is one side of the group that is ecstatic about the change, and the other side that fears the change. I heard the most common concerns for React Hooks are:</p><ul><li>Everything changes! <em>Subtle panic mode ...</em></li><li>React is becoming bloated like Angular!</li><li>It's useless, classes worked fine.</li><li>It's magic!</li></ul><p>Let me address these concerns here:</p><p><strong>Everything changes:</strong> React Hooks will change how we write React applications in the future. However, at the moment, nothing changes. You can still write class components with local state and lifecycle methods and deploy advanced patterns such as Higher-Order Components or Render Prop Components. Nobody takes these learnings away from you. See how I upgraded all my open source projects from older versions to React 16.6. and none of of these projects had problems. They are using HOCs, Render Props and I believe even the old context API (correct me if am wrong). Everything I have learned all these years still works. The React team makes sure that React stays backward compatible. It will be the same with React 16.7.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>8th issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=MLM">read the previous issues of the Machine Learning Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Hey everyone, <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/daniel-bourke" target="_blank" rel="follow">Daniel here</a>, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="follow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. I also write regularly about machine learning and on my own blog as well as make videos on the topic on YouTube.</p>
<p>Welcome to the eighth edition of machine learning monthly. A 500ish (+/-1000ish, usually +) word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found in the last month. </p>
<p>Since there's a lot going on, the utmost care has been taken to keep things to the point.</p>

<h2>What you missed in August as a Machine Learning Engineer…</h2>
<hr>
<h2>My work. Your benefit. 👇</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-id-start-learning-machine-learning-again-3-years-in/" target="_blank" rel="follow">[Article] How I'd start learning machine learning again (3-years in)</a></strong> — Three years ago I started studying machine learning in my bedroom. I know a lot more than when I started but one thing's still clear: how much there still is to learn. This article dives into a few of the things I'd change if I was starting again.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Best From The Internet 🕸</h2>
<h4>1. <a href="https://youtu.be/UOvPeC8WOt8" target="_blank" rel="follow">Visual neural networks by vcubingx</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A YouTube video series demonstrating the ins and outs of a neural network (chapter 1 is out now, more to come).</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> I'm always inspired by someone being able to explain a hard concept in an understandable way. If you've ever wanted a visual understanding of what happens when you write neural network code, check out this series.</p>
<h4>2. <a href="http://ai.googleblog.com/2020/08/using-machine-learning-to-detect.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">Using Machine Learning to Detect Deficient Coverage in Colonoscopy Screenings</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Google built a machine learning-based algorithm called C2D2 (Colonoscopy Coverage Deficiency via Depth) to see whether or not a colonoscopy scan covered sufficient portions of the colon.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Colorectal cancer (CRC) results in 900K deaths in the US per year. While it can prevented by removing potentially harmful polyps discovered in the colon through colonoscopy, many of them (up to 22-28%) get missed. A quarter of these that are missed have the potential to become cancerous. The C2D2 algorithm out performs physicians by 2.4x on synthetic videos. And 93% of experts agree with the algorithms scores when performing on real videos. Being able to better detect polyps better and earlier could reduce the rate of interval CRC (being diagnosed with CRC within 5-years of a previous diagnosis).</p>
<h4>3. <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/21/fastai2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Want to learn Deep Learning? Check out these fastai2 announcements</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new book — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527" target="_blank" rel="follow">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a>.</li>
<li>A new course — <a href="https://course.fast.ai/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> (covers deep learning and machine learning with fastai2 library).</li>
<li>A new library — <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/" target="_blank" rel="follow">fastai v2</a>: a complete rewrite of the original fastai to be faster, easier and more flexible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Whenever someone asks me how they should start learning deep learning, I recommend fastai. And the past two weeks have been the biggest in its history, releasing a new book, course and library all together. </p>
<p>I remember in my last machine learning engineer role, I watched a fastai lecture, implemented the technique Jeremy (founder of fastai) talked about and blew the previous results I'd got on a problem I'd been working on for a week out of the water, all in a few hours.</p>
<p>I've ordered the book and I'll be going through the course in the Summer (Australian Summer 😉: Dec-Jan).</p>
<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/t2V2kf2gNnI" target="_blank" rel="follow">Podcast with fastai founder Jeremy Howard and Weights &amp; Biases CEO Lukas Biewald</a> about the story of fastai and the future of ML.</li>
<li><a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2020/08/20/_08_21-beginner.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">Zero to Hero with fastai series</a> by Zachary Mueller: A ground-up approach to using the fastai library and how to use it for your own problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT" target="_blank" rel="follow">minGPT by Andrei Karpathy</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A miniature version of the GPT architecture which powers GPT2 and GPT3 (the natural language processing model currently taking the internet by storm, see <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/machine-learning-monthly-july-2020">last month's issue of ML Monthly</a> for more).</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Sometimes seeing state of the art architectures and models being released by large companies can be intimidating to those who are still learning the field. In minGPT, Andrei Karpathy shows you how the GPT architecture is implemented and trained using pure PyTorch. The cover photo makes the repo.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/minGPT/master/mingpt.jpg" alt="minGPT repo cover photo"></p>
<h4>5. Less supervised computer vision 🥽</h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A few recent resources about using less labelled data for deep learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial on <a href="https://hbilen.github.io/wsl-eccv20.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="follow">weakly-supervised learning in computer vision from European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2020</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-limited-labels-data-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learning with limited labels tutorial</a> from Nvidia at ECCV 2020.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/craffel/dl3d-seminar" target="_blank" rel="follow">Deep Learning with Limited Labelled Data seminar by Colin Raffel</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For the past few years, breakthroughs in AI have come from having access to large databases of labelled data. However, these databases take large amounts of time and resources to create. So it makes sense that there's a lot of interest in research to find ways around requiring these large amounts of labelled data to get desirable results. A few years ago, unsupervised methods would've been laughed out of the room. Now they're starting to compete with some of the best supervised methods, especially in NLP (GPT3 is totally unsupervised) and it seems computer vision is next.</p>
<h4>6. <a href="https://madewithml.com/projects/1964/mlops-tutorial-series/" target="_blank" rel="follow">MLOps tutorial series</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> MLOps is the combination of DevOps and Machine Learning. This tutorial series will show you how to bring one of the best DevOps practices, continuous integration, to your machine learning projects.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Machine learning is more than building models in notebooks. In fact, many of the most important steps in machine learning happen completely out of notebooks. If you want to get your models into the hands of others, you'll want to start picking up MLOps skills.</p>
<h4>7. <a href="https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-machine-learning/#fastapi" target="_blank" rel="follow">How to deploy and host a machine learning model with FastAPI and Heroku</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A step by step guide to deploying a stock price predicting model API using FastAPI (a Python web framework) and Heroku (a cloud computing platform).</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Don't let your machine learning models die in a Jupyter Notebook, get them live and see what happens when you and others interact with them.</p>
<h4>8. <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/on-device-supermarket-product.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">On-device supermarket product detection</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Using a computer vision powered app to learn more about supermarket products.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Food labels can be confusing at the best of times. Even more so, what if you couldn't see the food labels at all? Google's Lookout app uses computer vision to help solve these problems using on-device machine learning models (important because of poor connection in supermarkets) to help a user understand what they're looking at, displaying information such as nutritional facts, allergens and more.</p>
<h4>9. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/?nvid=nv-int-csfg-14125#cid=_nv-int-csfg_en-us" target="_blank" rel="follow">New Nvidia 30 series chips</a></h4>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Nvidia announced their latest consumer graphics cards, the 30 series with dramatic improvements over the previous generation. Due for release from September 17th onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If you're looking into building your own deep learning PC, you're probably going to use Nvidia GPUs. The new 30 series is based on Nvidia's Amphere architecture. In short, it means you're going to be getting more compute power for the money you pay. This is exciting because if you can run quality experiments on a local GPU (e.g. one of Nvidia's 30 series), scaling them up when necessary (e.g. to many GPUs on the cloud) is very easy to do.</p>

<h3>What you missed in August as a Python Developer…</h3>
<hr>
<h3>What To Expect In Python 3.9 ☔️</h3>
<p>Python 3.9 is coming soon and we all love learning the shiniest features of our beloved Python. So what's new? <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-08-15-what-to-expect-in-python-39/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Check out this article</a> to get you excited about what we have coming up.</p>
<h3>How Tracking Works 🛰</h3>
<p>I almost put this in the <em>Best Resource of the Month</em> section. It shows you how tracking pixels work, and even how to implement it yourself using some front end code and Python. <a href="https://healeycodes.com/privacy-focused-analytics-from-scratch/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learned a lot reading this one</a>, so don't skip it!</p>
<h3>Python Wishlist ⛲️</h3>
<p>Programmers always want more from their languages. Although adding more and more features is never the solution, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3566382/4-powerful-features-python-is-still-missing.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">this is the top 4 features that some people wish Python had</a>. Inspired by other languages. </p>
<h3>NLP And SEO Goodness 🎰</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/natural-language-processing-python-seo/377051/#close" target="_blank" rel="follow">This is a fun article</a> you don't see often: How can you use Natural Language Processing and building a knowledge graph in order to improve your website's SEO? A great way to learn the basics of SEO using Python. </p>
<h3>Plotly Wizardry 📊</h3>
<p>Plotly is one of my favourites when it comes to quick data visualizations. If you have not looked at using Plotly for python data visualization lately, you might want to take it for a spin. <a href="https://pbpython.com/plotly-look.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">This article</a> will discuss some of the most recent changes with Plotly, what the benefits are and why Plotly is worth considering for your data visualization needs <em>(it's very easy to use)</em>.</p>
<h3>Python Data API 🤹‍♀️</h3>
<p>This is big news. A new consortium was created to unify the Python data world together and solving a huge problem: <em>Python has exploded in popularity for data science, machine learning, deep learning and numerical computing. New frameworks pushing forward the state of the art in these fields are appearing every year. One unintended consequence of all this activity and creativity has been fragmentation in the fundamental building blocks - multidimensional array (tensor) and dataframe libraries - that underpin the whole Python data ecosystem. For example, arrays are fragmented between Tensorflow, PyTorch, NumPy, CuPy, MXNet, Xarray, Dask, and others. Dataframes are fragmented between Pandas, PySpark, cuDF, Vaex, Modin, Dask, Ibis, Apache Arrow, and more. This fragmentation comes with significant costs, from whole libraries being reimplemented for a different array or dataframe library to end users having to re-learn APIs and best practices when they move from one framework to another.</em> <a href="https://data-apis.org/blog/announcing_the_consortium/" target="_blank" rel="follow">See the solution here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you missed it here’s a <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-tools-partone/">link to part one of GraphQL tools &amp; libraries</a>. Now onto part two, where we check out a few more tools and libraries.</p>
<h2>Ariadne</h2>
<p><strong>Ariadne is a Python library for implementing GraphQL servers</strong> that prides itself on being schema-first. Schema-first is the approach of first defining the schema for the GraphQL service and then implementing the code by matching the definitions in the schema. The other approach is code-first where you first code the resolvers with the schema generated as an artifact. Which approach you chose is mostly up to personal preference, but let’s get back to schema-first and Ariadne and look at its features:</p>
<ul>
<li>schema-first lets both the client-side and server-side developers work at the same time since client-side developers don’t have to wait for a finished backend </li>
<li>a small and easy to learn, python based API with a focus on simplicity</li>
<li>open design, Ariadne is modular and open to customization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lighthouse</h2>
<p><strong>Lighthouse is a GraphQL framework that provides integration with Laravel (PHP) applications</strong>. It’s also schema-first and primarily uses SDL (Schema Definition Language) but also supports native PHP definitions. The idea is to take the best from both GraphQL and Laravel and combine it into a tool that makes your work much easier and provides lots of flexibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>schema-first and boilerplate free, use GraphQL SDL to describe your data and add functionality through server-side directives</li>
<li>takes full advantage of GraphQL and Laravel, build a GraphQL server on top of an existing Laravel application</li>
<li>instantly ready to use, generates optimized data queries out of the box and comes with sensible configuration defaults</li>
</ul>

<h2>GraphQL Editor</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL Editor is an all-around tool for the GraphQL schema development</strong>. The focus here is saving time and effort by visualizing schemas, creating one is as simple as joining blocks, no code required (if you prefer to create your schema the traditional way it’s still possible). This makes for a quick and easy to play with the tool, that will ease development and make communication with other team members much easier. That’s especially handy now, with everyone working via Zoom. </p>
<ul>
<li>Schema Visualization: readily available schema import via GQL file or copying code</li>
<li>Live JAMStack Engine: preview GraphQL queries inside the frontend and mock backend</li>
<li>GraphQL IDE: design schema or import one, includes error handling and type validation</li>
<li>GraphQL Docs: automatically generated, easily readable schema documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Altair</h2>
<p>Altair boasts being a beautiful, <strong>feature-rich GraphQL Client IDE for all platforms</strong>. The self-professed comparison is to be a Postman for GraphQL ie. letting the developer quickly and easily test and optimize GraphQL implementations. The features paint a good picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>visualization and simplicity, your schema is visualized in the docs along with information on queries, mutations, arguments, etc. adding a query requires only a single click</li>
<li>simple GraphQL subscription testing requires only the url</li>
<li>easy importing and exporting, from dragging and dropping a query to exporting your entire current window state with all the queries and variables</li>
</ul>

<p>When faced with a variety of options, how are developers building APIs supposed to know which is the right one for their solution? In this article, I’m going to outline the common characteristics for both REST APIs and message streaming so developers can better understand when (and when not) to use each one.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-rest-based-web-apis">Characteristics of REST-Based Web APIs<a href="#characteristics-of-rest-based-web-apis" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>REST-based web APIs create a conversation between a client (the API consumer) and an API server (the backend). When we build REST-based APIs within Capital One, we use HTTP as our protocol. Our designs depend heavily on HTTP, from the methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to the headers that help us communicate between client and server (e.g. Authorization, Accept, Content-Type).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-1.webp" alt="Request/response client-server list conversation"></p>

<pre><code>GET /projects
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
 [
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  ...
 ]
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-2.webp" alt="Request/response client-server create conversation"></p>

<pre><code>POST/projects
Content-Type: application/json

{ "name":"...", ... }

201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
 
 { "projectId":"...", "name":"...", ... }

</code></pre>

<p>The client (or API consumer) is the app, which sends a message (i.e. an HTTP request) to the API whenever it needs something. The server then replies with the response, including a status code that indicates if the request was processed successfully (2xx error code), failed due to client error (4xx error code), or failed due to server error (5xx error code). All communication flows from the consumer to the API backend.</p>

<p>When we add in hypermedia links, we extend the conversation with some additional information that may be helpful to the client:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-3.webp" alt="Request/response client-server hypermedia conversation"></p>

<pre><code>GET /projects/12345
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
 { 
 "name":"...", ...,
 "_links": {
   { "self" :"/projects/1234" }, 
   { "related_projects": [
     { "4567" :"/projects/4567" }, 
     { "8901" :"/projects/8901" }, 
     { "9012" :"/projects/9012" } 
   ]}, 
   { "members": [
     { "1" :"/users/1" }, 
     { "2" :"/users/2" }, 
     { "3" :"/users/3" }, 
     { "4" :"/users/4" }, 
     { "5" :"/users/5" } 
   ]}
 }
</code></pre>

<p>REST-based APIs have a specific set of characteristics that are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request/response model</strong> — API consumers send requests to an API server and receive a response.</li>
<li><strong>Pull-based interaction</strong> — API consumers send an API request when data or functionality is required (e.g. user interface, at a pre-scheduled time).</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> — API consumers receive the response after a request is sent.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple content types</strong> — since REST APIs are built upon HTTP, responses may be JSON, XML, or other content types as necessary to support consumer needs (e.g. CSV, PDF).</li>
<li><strong>Flexible interactions</strong> — Building upon the available HTTP verbs, consumers may interact with REST-based APIs through resources in a variety of ways: queries/search, creating new resources, modifying existing resources, and deleting resources. We can also build complex workflows by combining these interactions into higher-level processes.</li>
<li><strong>Caching and concurrency protocol support</strong> — HTTP has caching semantics built-in, allow for caching servers to be placed between the consumer and API server, as well as cache control of responses and eTags for concurrency control to prevent overwriting content.</li>
<li><strong>Internal and external access</strong> — REST APIs may be restricted for internal use or for external use by partners or public developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For most solutions, offering a REST-based API is a great starting point, allowing any application or automation script to interact with your API over HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-message-streaming">Characteristics of Message Streaming<a href="#characteristics-of-message-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Unlike REST APIs, message streaming is better at providing notifications when new messages arrive. Once subscribed, the client will be notified when new messages are available:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-4.webp" alt="Event-based API subscription"></p>

<pre><code>POST /subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{ "callbackUrl":"https://my.callback/path", ... }

201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
 
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the client is subscribed to a topic, it will receive notifications when new messages are available. This may be the result of a REST API processing incoming requests from a web or mobile app, then adding messages into the message stream topic to notify anyone that is interested:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-5.webp" alt="Event-based API notifications"></p>

<pre><code>POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project created event&gt;&gt;

POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project archived event&gt;&gt;

POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project updated event&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how our conversation became more interesting. We now can be notified when things change or critical business events occur; without needing to modify and redeploy the API to support a new integration that emerges in the future. This is called loose coupling, and it helps our systems be used in new ways without the originator of the messages even knowing about current and future subscribers.</p>

<p>Those familiar with message brokers will realize that this is familiar. The difference between a message broker and message streaming is that <em>message streaming allows us to revisit past messages in sequence as well</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-6.webp" alt="Streaming API conversation"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;request last 12 messages from project_messages topic&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;retrieve and send last 12 messages from project_messages topic&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This feature is useful when we need to go aggregate values or perform a new calculation we previously didn’t realize we needed.</p>

<p>Note — we can’t filter messages or perform other aggregate queries when requesting the messages — only the client can do this after requesting the messages from the topic. REST APIs are better suited for performing ad hoc queries than message streams.</p>

<p>As you are discovering, message streaming is a different style of interaction than REST-based APIs. Additional characteristics of message streaming are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Publish/subscribe model</strong> — Apps or APIs publish messages to a topic which may have zero, one, or many subscribers rather than a request/response model.</li>
<li><strong>Subscriber notification interaction</strong> — Apps receive notification when a new message is available, such as when data is modified or new data is available.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> — Unlike REST APIs, apps cannot use message streams to submit a request and receive a response back without complex coordination between parties.</li>
<li><strong>Single content-type</strong> — At Capital One, our message streaming is built upon Avro, a compact binary format useful for data serialization. Unlike HTTP, Avro doesn’t support other content types (e.g. CSV, PDF).</li>
<li><strong>Replayability</strong> — At Capital One, our message streaming is built on Kafka, subscribers may revisit and replay previous messages sequentially.</li>
<li><strong>No caching or concurrency protocol support</strong> — Message streaming doesn’t offer caching semantics, cache-control, or concurrency control between publisher and subscriber.</li>
<li><strong>Internal access only</strong> — Subscribers must be internal to the organization, unlike HTTP which may be externalized to partner or public consumers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Message streaming offers some additional communication options that REST-based APIs do not — push-based notifications when new data or state changes occur, and the option of revisiting past messages in the stream to perform new calculations or re-execute logic that failed previously. When combined together, REST-APIs enable consuming apps to integrate easily with an HTTP API, while message streaming allow consumers to be notified of changes without needing to check with the REST API first. This can be a powerful combination that can satisfy use cases that exist today, while allowing emerging use cases to be handled in the future — all without modifying existing systems to accommodate new solutions.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>As you may have realized, choosing between a web API and message streaming isn’t difficult, as long as you understand the characteristics of each one. REST APIs are best suited to request/response interactions where the client application sends a request to the API backend over HTTP. Message streaming is best suited to notification when new data or events occur that you may want to take action upon. Just be sure to match the needs of the consumer with one or more approaches to offer a robust interface to your solution’s capabilities.</p>

    <p><em>(Also see <a href="https://medium.com/@aitorvs/most-common-mistakes-during-interviews-545579cba19f">part 1</a> where I went over a few typical mistakes I have seen candidates make during interviews.)</em></p>
<p>Over the past years I have done a large amount of shadow interviews and in those I have seen some recurring common mistakes made by the interviewer. Most of them I have also made myself in the past when I started conducting interviews 10+ years back.
If you do interviews, maybe these lines resonate with you and help you get better.</p>
<p>(<em>Disclaimer: this is my personal view only</em>)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But before, what is a shadow interview? A shadow interview normally comprises two interviewers, main and secondary (aka. shadow). The main interviewer is generally someone starting interviewing for the first time (at the company).
The shadow interviewer role is to ideally not intervene during the interview, form their own idea about the performance of the candidate and most importantly take lots of notes that will serve as feedback to the main interviewer.</p>
<p>(<em>It is important to note that one can have plenty of years of experience interviewing and yet need to be shadowed in interviews in a new company. I find this a very good practice as it ensures that all interviewers in that given company conduct the interviews in the same manner</em>)</p>
<p>These are the common mistakes I have seen while shadowing interviews.</p>
<h3 id="1---no-greetings-no-intro-no-pleasantries-no-expectations">#1 - No greetings, no intro no pleasantries, no expectations</h3>
<p><em>TL;DR Greet the candidate and allow for 5 minutes chit chat before the interview and set the interview expectations</em></p>
<p>When starting as an interviewer it is very common to cut right to the chase and start right from the get go with the interview questions. We need to be aware that an interview will <strong>always</strong> be stressful for the candidate and giving 5 minutes to exchange some casual intros and pleasantries helps a great deal making the candidate feel a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>I also find it very important to greet the candidate when we first meet them. I find shaking hands very appropriate and necessary, I will not enter in the psychology behind shaking hands, but to me it clearly sends a nonverbal affirmation of non-hostility.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, try to give the heads up to the candidate about what are they going to experience. Nobody really likes the “unknown”, and adding to the stress of the interview the not-knowing what will happen next is really not necessary. One simple example might be: “<em>The interview will have three main parts, one coding challenge, of about 30min (…) and then we’ll move on to technical questions about the problem you just solved and another more general topics. You will have at the 5-10 min at the end of the interview to ask questions</em>”</p>
<h3 id="2---not-following-up">#2 - Not following up</h3>
<p><em>TL;DR Don’t just ask and move on, do follow up</em></p>
<p>Some interviewers like to script their questions, some others (like me) prefer to just follow the same interview structure and let the questions just flow. Regardless of what your style might be, it is a very common mistake in the beginning to ask a question, get and answer and just move no to the next one or next topic.
If you did that, chances are you just scraped the surface and didn’t get any meaningful signal from the answer.</p>
<p>Imagine the following interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q. “do you have experience leading projects?”</li>
<li>A. “Yes, in my previous company I led 3 projects, A, B and C. Each of them of about 6mo duration. A was about…B was about … and C about … . All of them were very successful and got me a promotion”</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think you got some solid signal that the candidate has experience leading projects. I would argue there is no sufficient signal. Some follow up questions I would ask might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q. “were you working on those projects alone or leading a team of engineers?”</li>
<li>Q. “before starting the project, how do you do its planning?”</li>
<li>Q. “did any of those projects miss the original deadline? what did you do in that situation? if not, what would you do if a project you’re leading starts getting delayed?”</li>
<li>Q. “what was your day to day and specific contributions while leading those projects?”</li>
<li>Q. “you mentioned the projects were very successful, could you define what success means in that context?”</li>
<li>Q. “is there any learning you took away from those projects? can you tell me one instance where you applied one of those learnings?”</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>and the list could go on and on.</p>
<h3 id="3---better-like-me">#3 - Better like me</h3>
<p><em>TL;DR Avoid unconscious bias in favor of candidates with your same background, strengths and weaknesses</em></p>
<p>I have noticed (and this is very subjective) over the years that one common bias is to like people that are like us.</p>
<p>In the context of interviewing, imagine that I could be better at algorithms but I am really good at system architecture. If I find a candidate that excels at architecture and is just OK at algorithms, I would tend to think that candidate is very good.
However, if the candidate was just OK at architecture and excelled at algorithms, I would probably not feel as strong as before.</p>
<p>I guess it is because it is just human overvalue the things that we excel at and undervalue those we could improve.
That is the reason why after all my interviews I go through all my notes, more than once, and I consciously try very hard to identify those kinds of biases in myself.</p>
<h3 id="4---not-helping-not-challenging">#4 - Not helping, not challenging</h3>
<p><em>TL;DR Don’t shy away from helping the candidate, your job as interviewer is helping them to show their best performance</em></p>
<p>When I started interviewing many years ago I assumed I was there to find out whether we wanted to hire the candidate or not. Gosh! it would have been so much easier if somebody had told me that I was there to help the candidate perform well during the interview (within certain limits, of course).</p>
<p>The subtle difference for me is that, when I came into an interview thinking that my job was to purely find out what the candidate knew or didn’t know, it just happened that I was moving onto the next topic/problem upon the first candidate’s mistake. I have seen the same behavior in many more newcomers to interviewing.
If you do this, most probably you are getting no signal. There can be many reasons why the candidate may struggle during the interview, for instance they may be nervous (even if you don’t feel it). More often than not, when I help a candidate, they just continue on their own and end up performing really well.</p>
<p>Another subtle mistake is to not challenge anything the candidate may tell you, especially when you agree with the answer. There are plenty of signals you can gather when challenging the candidate’s answer. You will see how they handle push backs; how they will stand their ground and their soft-skills in doing so; whether they just immediately agree with you, even if it is clear they’re right; how they explain concepts to others to make them easier to understand…All good signals that will give you a better idea about how the candidate will fit in the team.</p>
<h3 id="5---cold-ending-cold-feedback">#5 - Cold ending, cold feedback</h3>
<p><em>TL;DR It does not matter how the candidate performs, always encourage them and stay positive</em></p>
<p>In some interviews the candidate is going to perform very well, in some others the candidate will perform really bad. Regardless, I think it is very important to always be positive towards the candidate and act the same and in a positive manner.</p>
<p>This is very important even if your company only has one round of (on-site) interviews. I have been in places where it was common practice to abruptly finish the interview when it was clear it was a no-hire. It does not really matter how soft you are ending the interview, there is no good way to do that and adds to a terrible and unnecessary demotivating experience for the candidate.
If your company however has several rounds of (on-site) interviews, it is even more important to stay positive towards your candidate. You do not want to demotivate them for the interviews that may come after.
I have seen many candidates performing not so well in one interview and then nail all the subsequent ones ending with an offer.</p>
<p>One might ask, “<em>if the candidate performs very poorly, how do I stay positive without lying about their performance?</em>”. You don’t need to say anything about their performance during the interview. If the candidate does not finish the problem, or the solution is wrong, etc. just tell them that you’re looking for many more signals, not just whether the problem is finished and correct. And mean that while you say it, because <strong>it really is what you should be looking for</strong>. There are a lot of good signals that one can get from a candidate that struggled during an interview or problem solving.</p>
<p>If the candidate directly asks about their performance during the interview, tell the truth. Say you can’t tell them at that very moment. Because all interviewers will compile a lot of signals from all the interviews that are then put together to come to a conclusion. The final outcome does not depend on one single interview.</p>
<p>One might argue, “<em>I am looking for a candidate that is very strong at coding, what’s the point in continuing with the interview if it is clearly below the required bar?</em>”. Couple things I would say:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it happens that you bring somebody for an on-site interview that performs really badly, the problem is with the hiring process. Your process probably needs some previous filter. Use that interview to gather feedback to improve your process.</li>
<li>even if you have previous filters, they are never perfect. Strive to make the candidate’s interview experience as good as it can be. It is a reality that if the interview experience was good, even if it ended without an offer, candidates will recommend your company.</li>
<li>the fact that a candidate did not perform well once, does not mean that they will not do it a second time around. There was a reason why you brought them in in the first place. If they walk out with a good experience, they’ll probably re-apply in the future. And who knows, maybe that time their performance will be stellar.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-no-time-for-questions">#6-No time for questions</h3>
<p><em>TL;DR Always allow 5-10 minutes for questions from the candidate</em></p>

<p>Unlike the millions of years it takes for most mountains on Earth to form, lunar mountains crop out near instantaneously, geologically speaking.</p>



<p>Earth’s mountains primarily form when two colliding plates of the Earth’s crust lift up volumes of rock, slowly creating an elevated landform. Over millions of years, wind, water and gravity erode these uplifted sections, wearing their surface to make the mountains we are familiar with today.</p>



<p>But the Moon has no plate tectonics, atmosphere or running water. How then does it boast mountains several kilometers high? For instance, <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/03/18/mount-as-high-as-everest-zeeman-mons/">Zeeman Mons</a> on the lunar farside peaks as tall as Mount Everest.</p>



<p>The answer lies in the one of the most apparent features on the Moon – craters.</p>



<p>Most lunar craters are <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/05/27/what-does-a-fresh-crater-look-like-hell/">small and bowl-shaped</a>, formed when asteroids and comets impact the surface. This shape persists for crater sizes up to about 20 kilometers. Larger craters display more complexity.</p>



<p>The force imparted on the Moon’s surface by larger asteroids and comets, especially those with high velocities, can be tremendous. In such cases, in addition to a crater being formed, the surface in and around the impact point is compressed further. This causes the crust to melt. When the melted crust can’t be compressed any further, it bounces right back up, forming a central mountain. This process is visualized in the GIF below.</p>







<p>Most lunar mountains are formed by this highly energetic process that takes a geologically negligible passage of time. The kilometer-plus high central peaks of the young, city-sized <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/03/11/glorious-aristarchus/">Aristarchus crater</a> and 86-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/10/15/tycho-crater/">Tycho crater</a> are fine examples.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="633" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?resize=1200%2C633&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?w=1870&amp;ssl=1 1870w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?resize=1024%2C540&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?resize=200%2C105&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?resize=1536%2C810&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tycho-mountain-lro.jpg?resize=1200%2C633&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The central peak of Tycho crater.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/384" target="_blank">Credit: NASA LRO</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Aristarchus crater was one of the candidate landing sites for the now-cancelled Apollo 17+ missions. Visiting Aristarchus or Tycho in a future surface mission will allow us to study the exposed lunar interior by the virtue of their central mountains. Craters larger than these offer two central peaks.</p>



<p>The mechanics work such that for larger crater sizes or more energetic impacts, the newly formed central peak splits into two before it can solidify. The 93-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/04/08/a-peak-inside-the-moon-with-copernicus/">Copernicus</a> and 77-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/01/21/y-shaped-mountains-in-king-crater/">King</a> craters respectively host two distinct peaks, each towering more than six kilometers!</p>











<p>Apart from allowing scientists to study the lunar interior, such places are key to understanding mechanics of impacts that form such features, found not just on the Moon but across the Solar System.</p>



<h3>Put a ring on it </h3>



<p>For even larger craters, the twin peaks widen into a ring of mountains, like a liquid drop causing a ripple on still water. The 312-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/06/10/the-crowned-crater-of-schrodinger/">crater of Schrödinger</a> on the Moon’s farside is a well preserved example, despite being almost four billion years old.</p>







<p>A <a href="https://earthandsolarsystem.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/new-paper-a-robotic-mission-concept-to-return-samples-from-the-schrodinger-basin/">mission to Schrödinger</a> can help solve fundamental mysteries about the Moon’s evolution, like if the Moon indeed had a global magma ocean–a hypothesis tied to <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">its origin</a>. Further, Schrödinger lies inside the Moon’s largest impact crater, the 2,500-kilometer-wide South Pole-Aitken basin. The impact that created the basin excavated deep into the lunar crust, and perhaps even the mantle. Since Schrödinger formed later, its impact could’ve penetrated deeper and uplifted more materials, offering insights–literally and figuratively–into the lunar interior.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">Chicxulub crater</a> on Earth, linked to the extinction of dinosaurs, is also thought to have formed as a ringed crater, but wore down of its original form due to Earth’s active weathering. As such, Schrödinger offers an analog to better understand Chicxulub.</p>



<p>For crater sizes beyond 500 kilometers, you get not one but multiple rings of mountains. The 930-kilometer-wide ancient crater of <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/01/07/outstanding-orientale-multi-ring-basin-on-the-moon/">Orientale</a> on the Moon’s farside boasts three mountain rings, most of which is preserved.</p>







<p>Missions to both Schrödinger and Orientale can tell us exactly when did large asteroids and comets excessively bombard bodies in the Solar System. This period of blistering impacts is particularly important as Earth is thought to have gotten its water during this time.</p>



<p>For some ancient craters, like Imbrium on Moon’s nearside, only parts of the outermost mountain ring are visible today. The rest of the interior has been drowned in lava, which you see as dark regions on the Moon. The prominent, arc-shaped mountain range of <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/10/08/the-mountain-range-montes-apenninus/">Montes Apenninus</a>, forming Imbrium’s southeast border, stretches 600 kilometers long.</p>







<p>Multi-ring impact basins exist on many other worlds in the Solar System, like <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/9780640jpg">Caloris</a> on Mercury, <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/20130614_g8gsrngbas01">an unnamed basin</a> on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dione_-_Evander_basin.jpg">Evander</a> on Saturn’s moon Dione, and more. Jupiter’s moon Callisto boasts the largest multi-ring basin of the solar system, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_(crater)">Valhalla</a>, spanning 3800 kilometers wide.</p>







<p>The ubiquity of mountains formed by impacts across the Solar System and their consistent patterns indicate common geological mechanisms. And the Moon being so close to us presents us with an opportunity to study these fundamental processes in planetary science.</p>

<h3>Exploring the mountains</h3>



<p>Moon orbiters use remote sensing techniques to understand the composition of the lunar mountains. But to better understand the composition, structure and origin, surface missions are needed, especially sample return ones to determine precise ages. To that end, NASA had selected several of the above mentioned places as <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/leag2009/presentations/Day-2%20PM/03-35_Gruener.pdf">candidate landing sites</a> for the now cancelled Constellation program to return humans to the Moon.</p>



<p>However, sending landing and roving missions to lunar mountains is a bit of an engineering hurdle. Most surface missions of the past landed in the dark lunar plains – vast, solidified lava regions that provide a relatively uniform surface for spacecraft to land on. The rocky nature of the mountainous regions make it more difficult to safely touch down on. However, things may change with NASA’s upcoming Artemis missions.</p>



<p>The Artemis program aims to explore the lunar poles in this decade, both <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services-overview">robotically</a> and with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-companies-to-develop-human-landers-for-artemis-moon-missions">humans</a>. This requires developing precision landing technologies for safe descent on the challenging polar terrain, as a result also enabling surface missions to the lunar mountains. But there is a type of mountain that spacecraft can visit even with present-day technologies.</p>



<p>The Moon has experienced several distinct periods of volcanism in the last four billion years. Lava slowly oozing out of openings on the surface during such times have formed <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/11/05/unique-volcanic-domes-of-gruithuisen/">volcanic domes</a>. These domes aren’t as tall as the impact-created mountains and have gentle slopes. China’s third Moon landing mission, Chang’e 5, launching end of 2020 is targeting the largest such lunar dome, Mons Rümker.</p>







<p>The 70-kilometer-wide Mons Rümker is thought to have formed less than two billion years ago. The Chang’e 5 mission aims to bring back samples from the dome and determine its exact age. Since scientists use the Moon to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0401-the-lunar-chronology">calibrate the timing</a> of events across bodies in the Solar System, analysis of Chang’e 5 samples would be an invaluable addition to happenings in the geologically recent past.</p>



<p>Mountains on the Moon are a marvel that give us a peak (pun intended) into the lunar interior, help discern the chain of events in the Solar System’s evolution and improve our understanding of the physical processes that shape airless worlds everywhere.</p>

					<div><p><strong>How SocialBee started</strong></p><p><span>Ovi started off by creating a product named Nugget which he launched on Product Hunt and generated thousands of leads. However, it was hard to monetize Nugget. He was also creating social media automation tools internally to manage the promotion of Nugget. Ovi talked to some people and realized that the social media management tool that they created for internal use was more valuable than the Nugget. From there on, Ovi shifted his focus towards this new product and named it… Social Bee.</span></p><p><strong>SocialBee AppSumo Launch</strong></p><p><span>For the AppSumo launch, Ovi did not reach out to AppSumo himself… instead a customer reached out to AppSumo to propose the SocialBee lifetime deal and later AppSumo contacted Ovi to get this set up. He started a conversation with the AppSumo team and planned out the whole launch. Ovi ended up selling 5,000 units through AppSumo at a price of $49. The lifetime deal was sold out in just three weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Essentials for AppSumo launch</strong></p><p><span>To launch a lifetime deal on AppSumo, a product must be stable and you must have good support because if your product is different from other products, you will get a lot of customer support requests. Moreover, you need to have adequate help documentation to ensure you aren’t overrun by support requests.</span></p><p><strong>Converting to recurring customers</strong></p><p><span>Social Bee also provides concierge services which include creating social media posts for the clients and scheduling with the help of Social Bee. Most of the customers that bought social bee licenses also opted for concierge services which helped Ovi growing monthly recurring revenue, it is notoriously hard to convert AppSumo customers to recurring customers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>SocialBee growth channels</strong></p><p><span>One of their growth channels is content marketing. They don’t rely on blog posts only, they also create in-depth guides which they give for free. They also do guest posting and link that post to their guides. Another growth channel is affiliate marketing. Some customers reached out to Ovi to become partners whereas Ovi also reached out to some people for partnership. Third growth channel is paid marketing. They are now starting to invest heavily in paid marketing.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sorry-dave.jpg" alt="Sorry Dave">
Nobody likes being told “No”</p>

<p>To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.</p>

<p>The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “<a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/">Selling Sunset</a>,” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sunset.jpeg" alt="Selling Sunset">
I actually think that most of the characters on this show would be absolutely lethal at selling enterprise software</p>

<p>Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/">moving to the cloud</a> – can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">exponentially more complex</a>. The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.</p>

<h2 id="detractors-want-you-to-say-no">Detractors Want You to Say “No”</h2>

<p>Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.</p>

<p>Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.</li>
  <li>Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.</li>
  <li>Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.</li>
  <li>People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.</li>
  <li>Competitors.</li>
  <li>(Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is <strong>time</strong>. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data <em>just right</em> for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.</p>

<p>Ways to say Yes more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.</li>
  <li>Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.</li>
  <li>Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.</li>
  <li>Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales &amp; marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-salesforce">Case Study: Salesforce</h2>

<p>Salesforce has a <em>decent</em> product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.</p>

<p>If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.</li>
  <li>They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.</li>
  <li>They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).</li>
  <li>Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.</li>
  <li>Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-slack">Case Study: Slack</h2>

<p>Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have a web of Slash <code>/commands</code>, webhooks, and APIs that allow for easy integration.</li>
  <li>They used these tools to build a successful app marketplace, completing the platform strategy.</li>
  <li>They once made it dead simple <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/360001851047-FAQs-about-migrating-from-Atlassian-to-Slack">to migrate from their once-largest competitor, Hipchat</a> (they’ve since killed Hipchat in their sleep like Washington crossing the Delaware). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/migrate-slack-to-teams">They still provide this for Microsoft Teams</a>.</li>
  <li>Slack is now packed with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.</li>
  <li>As a horizontal SaaS product, Slack is a good fit for many organizations and relatively unlikely to find a particularly bad-fit customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Saying Yes often (or saying No infrequently) is important in enterprise sales cycles. To find more ways to say Yes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a flexible product with programmable hooks.</li>
  <li>Fill niche functionality with partners, turning yourself into a platform.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to import and export data in bulk.</li>
  <li>Build no-regrets enterprise features.</li>
  <li>Sell to the right customers.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>You already know that I'm pretty frustrated with the way we do things on the web. In order to fetch a list of things and display them as rectangles on a webpage, we need to jump through 1938137 hoops. What is this, Circus Charlie? Anyone? Remember that game??? I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

		<div>
						
<p>On July 6 2020 I believed that <a href="https://phalox.be/wp/looking-for-help/">Validat.r</a> (our service to help entrepreneurs bootstrap their startup) was ready for the big launch. The product wasn’t ready yet, but the value proposition was ready to receive feedback. Even with an incomplete offer, I knew from previous startup failures that early feedback is more important than a polished product. I prepared all the social media messages, unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters">UTM parameter links</a>, a post on <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/70-of-startup-ideas-suck-yours-doesnt-have-to-1898ed30c9">IndieHackers </a>and on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23751291">HackerNews</a>. I also created a little campaign tracker in <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a> (a Google Analytics alternative) to see how my conversions to the sign up form were going.</p>



<p>The goal of this first launch? To get some initial feedback from passerby’s and understand if the value proposition of the website made sense. I didn’t expect any actual conversions or any customers to sign up; but like many of us, the rush of visitor-adrenaline does make you hope secretly that you hit a gold vein.</p>



<p>And then reality kicked in…</p>



<h2>Stream of visitors</h2>



<p>On launch day, I made sure to free up time so that I could reply to any interested customers without delay. I wasn’t expecting thousands of visitors so I was happy to see that the evening of the launch brought 60 visitors to my landing page. After 4 days, 350 visitors paid a visit to my landing page, but now new traffic was reducing rapidly.</p>



<h2>Startup launch failure</h2>



<p>The big spike during launch, returned back to its resting state: around 1-2 visits per day. What’s worse, not a single of these visitors decided to get in touch. Such a failure.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="777" height="389" src="https://phalox.be/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matomo_analytics.png" alt="Graph of amount of visitors to validator.phalox.be shwoing a spike on launch day. It shows that the startup launch was a failure" data-id="726" data-full-url="https://phalox.be/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matomo_analytics.png" data-link="https://phalox.be/wp/?attachment_id=726" srcset="https://phalox.be/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matomo_analytics.png 777w, https://phalox.be/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matomo_analytics-300x150.png 300w, https://phalox.be/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/matomo_analytics-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"><figcaption>A spike like this is common for many startups</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>… or was it? While digging around on the internet, I found out that many startup launches showed a <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/product-hunt-launch#the-spike-of-hope-the-flatline-of-nope-and-why-product-hunt-is-not-the-holy-grail-of-your-startup-marketing">similar evolution</a>. The novelty and temporary front-page exposure make people click. But rarely do these people convert into customers – if they do, you’re one of the lucky 1% who got the market right. So rather than being sad about this experiment that didn’t have a particular goal to start with, it is actually a great opportunity to learn about your customers.</p>



<h2>Outcome</h2>



<p>From the initial launch, I learned that the Hacker News community is much more engaged than the Indie Hacker one and that some sections of the value proposition weren’t entirely clear. I even got the feedback that the offer doesn’t seem trustworthy. Even though all of this feedback seems relatively small, there are a ton of pointers to further develop the offer. It’s much better that people complain, than that they buy your offer, don’t use it and disappear again. Any kind of feedback from your customers is great and will help you further improve your offer.</p>



<p>It became obvious that <a href="https://phalox.be/wp/looking-for-help/">Validat.r</a> wasn’t like your next iPhone release. The audience is different and would require a different approach. I’ve now switched to reaching out to individual Indie Hackers who have shared their side hustles on Indie Hackers. I then take the time to really understand what they are trying to accomplish and provide some honest feedback together with an invitation to alpha test Validat.r. This approach is very time consuming, but has gotten me a couple of alpha testers. Have a look at my <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/phalox">post history</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re going to launch your startup, then by all means, try a release to a bigger audience (like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>). You might get lucky. But more importantly, you’re exposing your offer to potential customers so that they can give feedback. And this is always a great thing to do. If at all possible, try to limit the time you spent on polishing your landing page and just get it out there! If the content sucks, the looks won’t matter anyway.</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

<p>A groundbreaking new study commissioned by <em>Revolver News</em> concludes that COVID-19 lockdowns are ten times more deadly than the actual COVID-19 virus in terms of years of life lost by American citizens.</p>
<p>Up until this point there had been no simple, rigorous analysis that accurately and definitively conveys the true costs of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Accordingly, <em>Revolver News</em> set out to commission a study to do precisely that: to finally quantify the net damage of the lockdowns in terms of a metric known as “life-years.” Simply put, we have drawn upon existing economic studies on the health effects of unemployment to calculate an estimate of how many years of life will have been lost due to the lockdowns in the United States, and have weighed this against an estimate of how many years of life will have been saved by the lockdowns. <strong>The results are nothing short of staggering, and suggest that the lockdowns will end up costing Americans over 10 times as many years of life as they will save from the virus itself.</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 lockdown measures that Americans have had to endure for the greater part of 2020 represent one of the most dramatic, consequential, and damaging policy measures undertaken in this nation’s history. <strong>For the first time in its history, America has experienced a situation so crippling and perilous that long term financial and social stability have been legitimately threatened.</strong></p>
<p>As with everything in 2020 America, these lockdown measures have become deeply politicized. President Trump opposes further devastating lockdowns. In his recent Republican National Convention speech, President Trump raised the point that lockdowns have had very real and very devastating effects on the lives of many Americans.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Trump: “The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. &nbsp;Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it’s a surrender to the virus.” <strong><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974">[Politico]</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden, by contrast, has suggested that he is willing to impose further lockdowns if “scientists” tell him to do so. It is unclear which scientists Joe Biden would be listening to, as there is no consensus among scientists and experts as to whether or not lockdowns are worth the staggering costs they impose on the common man.</p>

<p><em>Revolver News </em>is very proud to present a rigorous study on such an important topic and we hope that this will be spread far and wide both within government and without to assist policymakers. This exclusive study is a collaborative guest contribution to <em>Revolver News</em>. Due to the unfortunately politicized nature of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the associated plausibility of professional repercussions, the authors have chosen for the time being to represent themselves pseudonymously.</p>

<p><strong>CHEAT SHEET</strong>: <strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard approaches to evaluating epidemic policy responses, involving the <em>Value of a Statistical Life</em>, have conceptual problems and are biased towards the elderly and rich.</li>
<li>Using a life-years criterion as an alternative shows that the lockdowns cost <strong>an order of magnitude more</strong> life-years than they saved.</li>
<li>Most of the publicized cost-benefit analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have used coarse measures like lives as units rather than life-years, which misleads politicians and the general public. COVID-19 deaths disproportionately impact the oldest members of the population, whereas the economic impacts of lockdowns disproportionately harm the youngest of the working population, who have far greater life expectancies at the time of impact.</li>
<li>Using prior research on workforce entrants and recent graduates entering into a market marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates of life-years lost can be determined. Extensive research on job displacement can be used to estimate the economic impact in life-years of starkly increased unemployment for mid-to-late career workers.</li>
<li><strong>Combining these analyses, we found that an estimated 18.7 million life-years will be lost in the United States due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Comparative data analysis between nations shows that the lockdowns in the United States likely had a minimal effect in saving life-years. Using two different comparison groups, we estimate that the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved between a quarter to three quarters of a million life-years.</strong></li>
<li>Every broad age category lost life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and older.</li>
<li>The media and state and local governments contributed to the panic by selectively presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of dubious benefit.</li>
<li>Public health researchers and health economists gave poor policy advice and made selective use of the prior research literature. They will likely be rewarded, not punished, by academia for their failure because of academia’s biases.</li>
<li>Public health in general is so biased and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it is not “not yet ready for policy analysis.”</li>
</ul>
<p>———————————</p>
<p><strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the following weeks, the countries of the world began implementing previously unthinkable measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the United States, some states quickly locked down nearly all physical businesses, venues, and public areas. As a short quarantine rapidly grew into an indefinite lockdown, some lawmakers and economists began asking if the lockdowns would cause more damage than the virus itself. Using empirical research, first-pass estimates can be made about the impact of the unprecedented lockdown in life-years lost. This can then be compared to the number to the estimated life-years lost to COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Why life-years? It is well-known that socioeconomic status (SES) appears to be linked to life expectancy and some of that association is causal, with higher SESes causing longer life expectancies through a number of channels. Most government policy analysts make decisions using the <em>Value of a Statistical Life (VSLs) —</em> which is about $10 million. If a regulation can save 1 life and costs $9 million, for instance, then it’s worth imposing to save a life. If it costs $11 million, then it’s not worth imposing to save a life. A problem with this approach is how coarse it is. Because SES is linked to life expectancies, actions by the government that do not result in direct loss of life are liable to being simply unaccounted for in this approach. For example, why not set the VSL at $100 million? Or $1? If you set the VSL too low, you will fail to impose many very cheap lifesaving regulations.<strong> Something perhaps more subtle is that if you set the VSL too high, then regulations you impose will reduce income so much by retarding economic activity that you will wind up reducing life expectancies through the SES-life expectancy channel.</strong> There are actually more fundamental issues with the use of a single VSL for all citizens (see Sunstein’s <em>Valuing Life</em> for a good overview), but many find the general equilibrium problems with it very intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, the COVID-19 conversation among public health analysts, bio-statisticians, economists, and policymakers <em>who are otherwise sensitive to the problems with VSL</em> has been dominated by the standard “coarse” VSL calculation above.</strong> We have seen no full policy analyses utilizing life-year approaches, although various studies have tried to estimate the average life-year losses per COVID-19 death. Controversy over estimating the correct value of a statistical life, problems with actually applying it in analysis as described above, and perhaps a certain odiousness associated with the rendering of human lives in dollar terms have pushed some health economists and public health analysts toward use of a life-years approach. This approach is simple, and in principle, involves no explicit conversion of human lives into money terms — although such a trade-off is implicit in any policy analysis. From the life-years’ perspective, a policymaker can compute the life-years lost and gained if they take a specific action. <strong>For instance, a new airline safety regulation may make users of airlines so safe that they save an average of 0.1 life-years per traveler, but the higher cost of air travel may induce potential passengers to switch to less safe car travel, costing the switchers an average of 0.3 life-years. If enough people switch to car travel, then the airline safety regulation will actually reduce the total life-years lived from the perspective of the transportation system as a whole.</strong></p>
<p>A life-year maximizer would say that the regulation should not be adopted. <strong>An advantage of the life-year approach is that it values all people’s life-years equally in principle. The life-year of an 80 year old is of equal value to that of a 20 year old.</strong> <strong>The …</strong></p></div></div></div>

        <p>Batteries comprise 30-40% of the upfront cost. To push electric mobility, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MORTH) of India, announced that all the states and union territories (UTs) <strong>have now been allowed the registration and sale of electric vehicles (EVs) without pre-fitted batteries</strong>.<br>
The move is likely to provide the necessary boost for the<strong> wider adoption of EVs across the country.</strong><br>
Practically, the government is striving to create an ecosystem to accelerate the uptake of electric mobility in the country. This will not only protect the environment and reduce the oil imports but also provide opportunities to the sunrise industry.<br>
What is the situation in India? According to the <a href="https://www.smev.in/"><strong>Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles</strong></a>, the sale of electric vehicles in this country increased by 20% in 2019-20, mainly driven by rising sales of two-wheelers.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

                          <p><em>At Purrweb, we’ve been developing applications for overseas markets for more than five years. <a href="https://www.purrweb.com/services/health/">Healthcare mobile app development</a> is one of the services we provide —&nbsp; and there’s a good reason why. The MHealth (Mobile + Health) industry is experiencing a real boom in America and Europe.</em></p>
<p>Everyday, more than 200 healthcare services are published in app stores.</p>
<p>Despite such rapid growth, the market is still far from saturation. Plus, the industry structure is currently changing: for example, several years ago, the vast majority of applications were actually lifestyle apps for sleep, training, and nutrition, but now there is a rapidly growing number of services that allow you to communicate with doctors, monitor physical condition and analyze symptoms. Moreover, researchers note that the niche of mobile applications for people diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, and depression is still almost unoccupied.</p>
<p>These circumstances make healthcare mobile app development very attractive for entrepreneurs who are fighting for the users’ attention. Since the competition is huge, every detail becomes crucial for the success of the application: sales, marketing, and, of course, the technology on the basis of which the project is implemented, reliability, convenience and the visual appearance. Our company is responsible for the last four points.</p>
<p>In this article, we are sharing core principles that we follow when providing healthcare mobile app development services to clients from the Western market. These rules allow us to deliver solid healthcare apps within just 3 months.</p>
<h2>1. Focus on the users, not on the clinic</h2>
<p>In Russia and beyond, healthcare mobile app development services are in great demand among clinics. And this is logical since the use of technology is an important indicator of professionalism and quality of the services provided by the organization: according to the survey, 79% of patients are more likely to choose a healthcare provider that will provide ‘technological support’ during the treatment period, and half of the participants are even ready to change the clinic and the doctor in order to meet this criterion.</p>

<p>MHealth application is an effective way to attract clients and start interacting with them, that’s why the focus should always be on the end-users, their needs, problems, and doubts.</p>
<p>Healthcare mobile app development is a working way to get more clients — fact. But there’s an important nuance here. Being user-centered is more than repeating this classic ‘We care about targets’ mantra. At MHealth, it is a systematic process of building trust. To achieve it, the user should understand how the service works, clearly see the results and be sure that the confidential information is completely secure.</p>
<p>In America, healthcare mobile app development services and applications must comply with the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) standards — it’s a set of rules for maintaining confidentiality and ensuring safety of the patients’ data. Compliance with these requirements serves as a guarantee for users that their private information is 100% safe.</p>
<p>In Russia, there is a similar regulation for healthcare mobile app development — the order of the Ministry of Health ‘On the approval of the procedure for anonymizing information about people who receive medical care, as well as about people who are undergoing medical examinations.’ Compliance with the requirements of this order is mandatory from a legal point of view, but you’ll need additional manipulations if you want to make people trust your service. For example, once we’ve implemented a feature that allowed users to decide which data their doctors can view and which data should be hidden. It seems nothing new, but for most people this is an important nuance.</p>
<h2>2. Medical services with ‘non-medical’ look and feel</h2>
<p>The main difference which makes foreign healthcare services stand out is that they don’t actually look like healthcare applications. Minimalism, purity, and a calm color scheme — these are the three key principles that determine their appearance.</p>
<p>When trying to solve health problems, we are used to wading through complex terms, complicated processes, and messy descriptions. Moreover, there is a widespread myth that all this complexity is a good indicator of deep expertise and seriousness. Many developers pull this complexity into the interfaces with the words ‘We are not like that, the industry is like that.’</p>
<p>Yes, healthcare is a really complex industry, including many legal nuances to keep in mind throughout the entire product building process. But this should not affect the interface, design, and user scenarios. The application is a bridge between doctors and people who don’t have medical education. And it is crucial to make this bridge convenient and reliable.</p>
<p>Several noteworthy conclusions follow from this: a digital service should not replace doctors, and therefore it should not compete with them in terms of ‘expertness’. By using complex terms and confusing scenarios, you won’t gain the users’ trust, which is vital. The main objective of MHealth applications is to make sure that doctor-patient communication is the smoothest possible, which is not as hard as it seems at first glance.</p>

<p>For instance, you can automate a certain part of the entire communication process. One of our clients, American startup Lytic, uses a chatbot to automatically collect anamnesis (symptoms and complaints). The chatbot asks leading questions, offers answer options, and if there is a suspicion of a disease, it offers to schedule an appointment with a particular doctor or to take a particular test. So, when the doctor sees the patient, the initial information is already gathered — that significantly reduces wait times and streamlines the admission process.</p>
<p><a><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1.gif" alt="healthcare mobile app development" width="1400" height="901"></a><span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/portfolio/healthcare/">Healthcare system</a> Lytic that we’ve created at Purrweb</span></p>
<p><span>Chatbot looks like a standard messenger and helps users to describe their condition in a very easy and well-structured way.</span></p>
<h2>3. Gamification for motivation</h2>
<p>Being able to see the results often inspires people. Gamification sounds like the best way to manage motivation by demonstrating progress.</p>
<p>But MHealth applications require balance, since caring for health is still not a game: users don’t like too funny, cartoony solutions. Gamification should be engaging, meaningful, but still serious enough.</p>
<p><a><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.gif" alt="healthcare mobile app development" width="800" height="600"></a><span>We have created special dashboards and integrated gamification elements into the application which allows doctors to prescribe medications to their patients</span></p>
<p>By integrating gamification elements in the UI we could motivate users to take medications on time and not quit their treatment.</p>
<h2>4. The more personalization, the better</h2>
<p>The huge problem with MHealth applications is that most users download them, open them once or twice, and then never come back again. One of the reasons is the irrelevance of recommendations and content to their daily routine.</p>
<p>Users don’t want to strain too much and change their lifestyle in order to integrate healthcare into their lives — they expect both the application and healthcare to be integrated into their usual lifestyle with minimal effort. Yes, it’s a controversial desire, but there is an important insight.</p>
<p>When it comes to healthcare, the target audience cannot be imagined as ‘active 30+ men with the above-average income’. Health state and physical conditions depend on each person, plus everyone has different tastes, abilities, habits, and besides, all these factors are constantly changing.</p>
<p>There are two ways of coping with the heterogeneity of target audience. One option is to make the services as customized as possible, for example, for people of a certain social stratum who are struggling with depression.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the service should have powerful personalization tools, like polls or chatbots. You may have a decent weight control solution, but if your app constantly offers oranges to a person who doesn’t like them, instead of finding a good alternative — the future of this app will be blurred.</p>
<p><a></a><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.png" alt="healthcare mobile app development" width="1400" height="1120" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-300x240.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-768x614.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x819.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>FitForce, a <a href="https://www.purrweb.com/portfolio/fitforce/">mobile app for sport trainers</a> that we’ve developed at Purrweb</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;For this project, we’ve implemented a feature enabling trainers to create their own training system and update it in real-time.</p>
<h2>5. Clear user scripts</h2>
<p>According to the statistics, the user makes a maximum of three attempts to understand how the application works. If they fail to register, schedule an appointment with a doctor or receive a recommendation, the app is likely to go to the bin.</p>
<p>To prevent this, you must take into account that the healthcare apps market includes not only millennials but also people aged 40+ and 50+. However, even if your service is aimed at older audiences, this is still not a reason to create a made-in-early-00s design.</p>
<p>As the practice shows, you should still adhere to the principles of cleanliness and minimalism when developing interfaces. However, in parallel with this, it’s crucial to add tooltips explaining how the app works to the users.</p>
<p>There are other ways to simplify interaction with the app, for example, saving history of actions, reusing previously entered information for the sake of reducing the number of steps in the future, and so on.</p>
<p><a></a><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.png" alt="healthcare mobile app development" width="2800" height="3820" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.png 2800w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-220x300.png 220w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-768x1048.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-751x1024.png 751w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px"></a><span><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/portfolio/saidali/">Pharmacy app</a> designed by Purrweb&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>For this app, we’ve created a separate profile page for storing information about payment methods, prescriptions, and popular products.</p>
<h2>Wrapping things up</h2>
<p>There are many nuances in launching mobile applications in the healthcare industry, but this doesn’t substitute one of the main startup rules: you should not delay the app release. If you are absolutely happy with the first version of the product, it’s likely that you’ve released it too late. In conclusion, we’d like to share a (super short) list of Purrweb rules which will help you launch healthcare &amp; wellness-related MVP under tight deadlines — namely, in just 3 months.</p>
<p>Firstly, most IT teams run themselves ragged before the release, although it’s more …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="basic-javascript-rendered-hello-world">Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World</h2>
<p>Let's see how to render Hello World using basic javascript.</p>
<p>My HTML contains a single <code>div</code> with <code>id</code> as <code>root</code></p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'root'</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to add <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> to that root div.</p>
<p>We can do that using javascript's document API. Let's see how</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)


<span>const</span> divElement = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'div'</span>)
divElement.textContent = <span>'Hello World'</span>
divElement.className = <span>'container'</span>


rootElement.append(divElement)
</code></pre>
<p>What we are doing here is very simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a reference to the actual DOM root element</li>
<li>Create a new div element using <code>document.createElement</code> and then set its class and textContent</li>
<li>Append this newly created element to the root div element.</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the following HTML markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'root'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="intro-to-raw-react-apis">Intro to raw React APIs</h2>
<p>Now let's try to use React's raw APIs to create markup that we need instead of (vanilla) javascript.</p>
<p>We need two important APIs to achieve our task. In vanilla javascript. they are:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span>.createElement()
rootElement.append(domElement)
</code></pre>
<p>The React's equivalent of these two APIs are:</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement()
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see <code>React.createElement()</code> in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="reactcreateelement">React.createElement()</h3>
<p>This accepts three parameters</p>
<ol>
<li>Component or Tag to use to create the element</li>
<li>Props for the component</li>
<li>Children</li>
</ol>
<p>The API looks like <code>React.createElement(component, props, ...children)</code></p>
<p>So, to create an element like <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code>, you would do </p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, { className: <span>'container'</span> }, <span>'Hello World'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Our HTML will have</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"root"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to append <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> to the root element using React, we do:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, <span>'Hello World'</span>)

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>Can you see how similar the React's API is to the normal vanilla js document API? </p>
<p>Note that, you can even create nested elements using this.</p>
<p>For example, let's try to create the following markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To create the above markup</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> helloElement = React.createElement(<span>'span'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello'</span>)
<span>const</span> worldElement = React.createElement(<span>'span'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'World'</span>)
<span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, helloElement, worldElement)

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>You can even use a special <code>children</code> prop to add the children like the following</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>, children: [helloElement, worldElement]})
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is same as the below code</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, helloElement, worldElement)
</code></pre><h2 id="using-jsx">Using JSX</h2>
<p>If you have already been using React or saw the React code any time, you most probably would not have seen <code>React.createElement</code> being used. Instead, you might have seen some code that looks similar to HTML. Let's see what it is.</p>
<p>JSX is HTML-like syntactic sugar on top of raw React APIs. </p>
<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is equivalent to </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {id: <span>'container'</span>}, <span>'Hello World'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>But JSX is not a valid javascript code, so we use a compiler called <code>Babel</code> to convert JSX code to its corresponding <code>React.createElement</code> code.</p>
<p>Now, let's see how easy it is to create the following markup using JSX.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are some subtle differences between JSX and HTML. </p>
<p>For example, in HTML to add class to an element, we add it like <code>class='container'</code>, whereas in JSX, we need to write <code>className='container'</code>. </p>
<p>There are some other differences when using JSX which I will explain later in the post.</p>
<h2 id="interpolation-in-jsx">Interpolation in JSX</h2>
<p>Since JSX is written in javascript itself, there are some very interesting things which you can do. One of those is using JSX interpolation. It basically gives us the ability to use javascript inside of JSX. Whenever you do interpolation, you would surround it with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. This tells the Babel compiler that interpolation is being used here.</p>
<p>For example, take the following code</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you want the class name and text content to be dynamic, you can do something like</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divClassName = <span>'container'</span>
<span>const</span> divTextContent = <span>'Hello World'</span>

<span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>{divClassName}</span>&gt;</span>{divTextContent}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Can you see the flexibility that interpolation gives us? </p>
<h3 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h3>
<p>You can even add conditionals and loops in JSX</p>
<pre><code>{ condition ? <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span> : <span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span> }</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see above, to use conditionals in JSX, you would make use of the tertiary operator.</p>
<pre><code>{items.map((item) =&gt; <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>key</span>=<span>{item.id}</span>&gt;</span>{item.title}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>)</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>To use loops, you will use the <code>map</code> function.</p>
<p>You can even use template literals in JSX like</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> element = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>{`item-${itemId}`}</span>&gt;</span>{itemContent}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about JSX, head over to <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX in Depth</a> - React's official docs</p>
<h2 id="creating-custom-components">Creating custom components</h2>
<p>Consider the following JSX code</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here you can see the code <code>&lt;div className='message'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> is duplicated at two places.</p>
<p>To avoid duplication, the simplest thing we can do is to create a function and then call it instead.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>text</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{text}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {message('Hello World')}
    {message('Goodbye World')}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's refactor this a bit.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {message({children: 'Hello World'})}
    {message({children: 'Goodbye World'})}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's refactor this even more to use React.createElement</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {React.createElement(message, null, 'Hello World')}
    {React.createElement(message, null, 'Goodbye World')}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Previously in all the examples that we have seen, the first argument of React.createElement() is a string like 'span' or 'div'.</p>
<p>But React.createElement also accepts a function that returns something renderable like JSX, some string, number etc.</p>
<p>That's why the above code works.</p>
<p>Now, let's convert the above code to JSX</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>message</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>message</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>message</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>message</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above code seems to be perfect, right? Actually it's not. The above code will not work as intended. The reason being how babel compiles the JSX code to it's corresponding React.createElement() code.</p>
<p><code>&lt;message /&gt;</code> is compiled by babel to <code>React.createElement('message')</code>. But what we want is <code>React.createElement(message)</code>. In the first case, the first argument is a string, in the second case, it's a function.</p>
<p>For the babel to convert it into what we needed, we have to make the <code>message</code> function name uppercase.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this <code>&lt;Message&gt;Hello World&lt;/Message&gt;</code> will be compiled to <code>React.createElement(Message, {children: 'Hello World'})</code>, which is exactly what we needed.</p>
<p>Check the below examples to see how Babel compiles each of the JSX formats.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>JSX</td><td>React.createElement()</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Capitalized /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Capitalized)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;property.access /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(property.access)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Property.Access /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Property.Access)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Property['Access'] /&gt;</code></td><td><code>SyntaxError</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;lowercase /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('lowercase')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;kebab-case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('kebab-case')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Upper-Kebab-Case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Upper_Snake_Case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;lower_snake_case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('lower_snake_case')</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, we can see that the component name needs to be UpperCamelCased for it to work as intended.</p>
<h3 id="proptypes">PropTypes</h3>
<p>Let's slightly change the previous message component so that it accepts <code>name</code> prop.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Message</span>(<span>{name}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Hi, your name is {name}.<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>Message</span> <span>name</span>=<span>'foo'</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>Message</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This produces</p>
<pre><code>Hi, your name <span>is</span> foo.
Hi, your name <span>is</span> .
</code></pre><p>This doesn't look good. Does it? So what if there is a way we can enforce that the name needs to be passed and it needs to be a string.</p>
<p>Luckily, React gives us …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentBody"><p>While working on a completely different project, I started to ask myself how the <code>who</code> command was working under the hood. In the end, I thought it was a good topic for a blog post.</p><h2 id="who-is-who">Who is <code>who</code></h2><p>Let’s start with the basics. the <code>who</code> command allows you to list the users currently logged on the system.
For example, on my machine:</p><pre><code>$ who
gauthier tty2         2020-08-30 15:06 (tty2)
gauthier pts/1        2020-08-30 15:06 (tmux(1555).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-30 16:41 (tmux(1555).%6)
gauthier pts/4        2020-08-30 15:57 (tmux(1555).%3)
</code></pre><p>It tells me that I am logged on the “physical” terminal <code>tty2</code> and on three pseudo terminals. Indeed my current session of Gnome Shell is running on <code>tty2</code> and I have 3 <code>tmux</code> windows open.</p><p>But where is it getting those information? Probably from a file as everything is a file with Linux, but let’s check which one and how the data is stored there.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-reverse-engineering">A bit of reverse engineering</h2><p>In order to see what the <code>who</code> command is doing I could try to find the source code and dig into it. But I found it fun to use <code>strace</code> to check what the process was doing instead. Since we are expecting <code>who</code> to read system files, we can only focus on the <code>open</code> syscalls.</p><pre><code>$ strace who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
</code></pre><p>We can quickly filter what is interesting and what is not. The first files two files <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code>, <code>/usr/lib/libc.so.6</code> are shared libraries loaded by the process, those are interesting us.</p><p>Then <code>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</code>, <code>/var/run/utmp</code> and <code>/etc/localtime</code> are opened. Let’s see what those files are storing.</p><p>When exploring this kind of topics, it is always interesting to first search into the man pages before starting browsing the web. The 5th section of the manual is dedicated to “file formats and conventions” and seems a good place to start.</p><h3 id="locale-archive">locale-archive</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>locale(5)</code> where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  locale  definition file contains all the information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into the binary locale data‐base.
</code></pre><p>The page also sends us to <code>locale(7)</code> for more explanation about those informations:</p><pre><code>A  locale is a set of language and cultural rules. These cover aspects such as language for messages, different character sets, lexico‐graphic conventions, and so on. A program needs to be able to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.
</code></pre><p>So the <code>who</code> command read from this file, probably using the <code>setlocale(3)</code> function, to find out how the information should be formated and displayed.</p><p>We can actually check it:</p><pre><code>$ LC_ALL='fr_FR.utf8' who

gauthier pts/1        Sep  2 12:11 (tmux(2445).%0)
gauthier pts/2        Sep  2 12:37 (tmux(2445).%1)
gauthier pts/3        Sep  2 13:04 (tmux(2445).%2)
</code></pre><p>Indeed, the date is is not formated the same way!</p><h3 id="localtime">localtime</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/etc/localtime'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>localtime(5)</code> which explains:</p><pre><code>The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the local system that is used by applications for presentation to the user.
</code></pre><p>Probably <code>who</code> uses this file (or uses a function that is using this file) to print timestamps (columns 4 and 5 of <code>who</code>'s output) using the correct timezone configured by the user.</p><h3 id="utmp">utmp</h3><p>Finally comes <code>/var/run/utmp</code>:</p><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/var/run/utmp'
/usr/share/man/man5/utmp.5.gz
</code></pre><p>Where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  utmp  file  allows  one to discover information about who is currently using the system.  There may be more users currently using the system, because not all programs use utmp logging.
</code></pre><p>Great! We found where the <code>who</code> command is getting its data. It would be nice to be able to read this file to get those data without using the <code>who</code> command. Unfortunately:</p><pre><code>The file is a sequence of utmp structures, declared as follows in &lt;utmp.h&gt; (note that this is only one of several definitions around; details depend on the version of libc):
</code></pre><p>At this point we understood what the <code>who</code> command is doing: it is reading <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, parsing the content and formating it nicely. Let’s see if we can reproduce this simple behavior.</p><h3 id="my-own-who">My own <code>who</code></h3><p>What we simply need to do is: open <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, read <code>n</code> bytes (where <code>n</code> is the size of the <code>utmp</code> structure), print the info contained in each structure, continue until we reach the end of the file. With a bit of formating, we can even make it look like the original <code>who</code> command.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;utmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;locale.h&gt;

int main() {
  // set the right locale to display the information nicely
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

  // open the file
  FILE * file= fopen("/var/run/utmp", "rb");

  // just for safety
  if (file == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  // initialize the utmp structure
  struct utmp entry;

  // read the entries from the file one by one
  while (fread(&amp;entry, sizeof(struct utmp), 1, file) != 0) {
    if (entry.ut_type != USER_PROCESS)
      continue;

    // format the date (remember who uses the /etc/localtime?)
    char date[80];
    time_t raw_time = entry.ut_tv.tv_sec;
    struct tm *ts = localtime(&amp;raw_time);
    strftime(date, sizeof(date), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M", ts);

    // print the output for this entry, tries to mock who's output
    printf("%-8s %-12s %s (%s)\n", entry.ut_user, entry.ut_line, date, entry.ut_host);
  }

  fclose(file);
}
</code></pre><pre><code>$ clang -o who who.c
$ ./who

gauthier pts/3        2020-08-31 10:33 (tmux(2220).%5)
</code></pre><p>TADA!</p><p>We can also check with <code>strace</code> if the behavior is the same:</p><pre><code>$ strace ./who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -e open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4
</code></pre><p>Indeed our program is doing the same as the original <code>who</code>.</p><p>Of course, this only mocks the most basic features of the <code>who</code> command and doesn’t handle any option, like the famous <code>who am i</code> or <code>who mom hates</code>.</p><h3 id="going-further">Going further</h3><p>There is still a lot to say about the <code>who</code> command. We could for example mention the <code>lastlog</code> command and its corresponding file <code>/var/log/wtmp</code>, dig into the <code>utmp</code> structure, or just try to understand what <code>utmp</code> stands for.</p></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name. Now I can try to migrate this knowledge to integrate this to microk8s local setup.</p><h2 id="integrating-let-s-encrypt-with-dns-challenge-into-microk8s-setup-using-cert-manager">Integrating Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge into microk8s setup using <code>cert-manager</code></h2><p>I am not going to describe microk8s Kubernetes setup as it is pretty straightforward compared to the plain Kubernetes setup.</p><p>The first step is to install <code>cert-manager</code> I will be using Helm to install it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now let's configure Certificate Issuer.

September 3, 2020 | https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>All forms of signing email are generally solving the wrong problem (a thesis)</h2>

	<p><small>August 30, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Modern email is full of forms of signed email. Personally signed
email is the old fashioned approach (and wrong), but modern email
on the Internet is laced with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a>, which
have the sending system sign it to identify at least who sent it.
Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the more I feel that
signed email is generally solving the wrong problem (and if it's
solving the right one, we won't like that solution in the long run).</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols">why email often isn't as good as modern
protocols</a>, which is because it's what I
described as an <em>anonymous push</em> protocol. An anonymous push protocol
necessarily enables spam since it allows anyone to send you things.
Describing email as 'anonymous push' makes it sound like the anonymity
is the problem, which would make various forms of signing the
solution (including DKIM). But this isn't really what you care about
with email and requiring email to carry some strong identification
doesn't solve the problem, as we've found out with all of the spam
email that has perfectly good DKIM signatures for some random new
domain.</p>

<p>(This is a version of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TwoSidesOfIdentity">the two sides of identity</a>.
On the Internet people can trivially have multiple identities, so
while an identity is useful to only let selected people in, it's
not useful to keep someone out.)</p>

<p>I think that what you really care about with modern communication
protocols is <em>revocable authorization</em>. With a pull protocol, you
have this directly; you tacitly revoke authorization by stopping
pulling from the place you no longer like. With a push protocol,
you can still require authorization that you grant, which lets you
revoke that granted authorization if you wish. The closest email
comes to this is having lots of customized email addresses and
carefully using a different one for each service (which Apple has
recently automated for iOS people).</p>

<p>Obviously, requiring authorization to push things to you has a
fundamental conflict with any system that's designed to let arbitrary
strangers contact you without prearrangement (which is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/FundamentalSpamProblem">the
fundamental problem of spam</a>).
Modern protocols seem to deal with this in two ways (even with
revocable authorization); they have some form of gatekeeping (in
the form of accounts or access), and then they evolve to provide
settings that let you stop or minimize the ability of arbitrary
strangers to contact you (for example, Twitter's settings around
who can send you Direct Messages).</p>

<p>(The modern user experience of things like Twitter has also evolved
to somewhat minimize the impact of strangers trying to contact you;
for example, the Twitter website separates new DMs from strangers
from DMs from people you've already interacted with. It's possible
that email clients could learn some lessons from this, for example
by splitting your inbox into 'people and places you've interacted
with before' and 'new contacts from strange people'. This would
make DKIM signatures and other email source identification useful,
apart from the bit where senders today feel free to keep changing
where they're sending from.)</p>

<p>PS: In this view, actions like blocking or muting people on Twitter
(or the social network of your choice) is a form of revoking their
tacit authorization to push things to you.</p>

<p>This is the third post of a collection of GitOps tools articles. In this post, a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes is reviewed:&nbsp;<strong>Werf</strong>. If you missed previous articles on GitOps tools, you could give them a read, as it will help you better understanding the general idea. <a href="https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/05/13/gitops/">ArgoCD</a> and <a href="https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/05/24/gitops-fluxcd/">FluxCD</a>, were the previously reviewed tools.</p>



<p>As for the previous tools, an example repository has been developed so that you can test Werf with some existing configurations. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds">here</a>.</p>







<h2>GitOps &amp; Werf ⛵</h2>



<p>GitOps is defined as a way of managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications, in which git repositories hold the declarative definition of what has to be running in Kubernetes. A git repository is considered as the&nbsp;<em>single source of truth</em>&nbsp;in the GitOps model. With this approach, changes in the application definitions (code), are reflected on the infrastructure. Besides, it is possible to detect differences and drifts between the source controlled application and the different versions deployed.</p>



<p>GitOps allows faster delivery rates, as once the code is pushed to the production branch, it will be present in the cluster in a matter of seconds, increasing productivity. This Model also increases reliability, as rollbacks and recovery procedures are eased by the fact that the entire set of applications is control versioned by Git. Furthermore, stability and consistency is also improved.</p>



<p><a href="https://werf.io/">Werf</a> is an open source GitOps tool which aims to speed up application delivery by automating and simplifying the complete application lifecycle. To do so, Werf builds and publishes images, deploys applications to Kubernetes clusters, and removes unused images based on policies and rules defined in the Git repository.</p>







<p>Werf can build Docker images from Dockerfiles or using and alternative builder, which uses a custom syntax, and can support Ansible as well as incremental rebuilds based on Git history.</p>



<p>Werf deploys applications to Kubernetes using Helm-compatible charts with more extensive customizations. Furthermore, it provides rollout tracking, error detection and logging mechanisms for the application releases. The logic driving these mechanisms can be customized by means of Kubernetes annotations.</p>



<p>Werf is distributed as CLI written in go, so it can run virtually in any modern OS and it can be easily integrated with any CI/CD platform, as it has been developed to do so.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Installing Werf 💻</h2>



<p>In order to install Werf CLI, first you need to install Docker and Git in your machine. In case you haven’t installed them yet, you can find the installation instructions for Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">here</a>, and for Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>. Once these dependencies are present, it’s time to install Werf.</p>



<p>Werf advises to install their CLI by means of the <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/installation.html#method-1-recommended-by-using-multiwerf">multiwerf </a>utility, which ensures that the Werf CLI is always up to date. Execute the following commands to get it installed in your machine.</p>



<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
mkdir -p ~/bin
cd ~/bin
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/werf/multiwerf/master/get.sh | bash</code></pre>



<p>Select the Werf version to use and configure your terminal session to use that version by issuing the following command. Werf provides <a href="https://werf.io/releases.html">5 stability levels</a> to choose from, so that you can choose a level depending on your environments and needs.</p>



<pre><code>. $(multiwerf use 1.1 stable --as-file)</code></pre>



<p>In case you don’t want to use multiwerf features, you can just follow the ‘old good’ approach and get a specific version of the Werf CLI binary form <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/installation.html#method-2-by-downloading-binary-package">here</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Project structure 📁</h2>



<p>Werf expects files to be organized following a specific structure within the code repository. The image below shows the structure of the example repository that we will be using for this post, which contains a simple webpage (in <strong>/web</strong>) that is packaged in a nginx Docker image, and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM.png 345w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px"></figure></div>



<p>On the top level of the repository you can find <strong>werf.yaml</strong>, a YAML configuration file for Werf which defines how to build the images, and contains some metadata and directives that allow customizing the behavior of Werf. This file contains metadata information, images build information and artifacts build information each part separated by three hyphens. Werf also supports Go templates for the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file, as you can notice in the last line of the following example, making configurations really powerful. Besides, by including different templates, <strong>werf.yaml</strong> can be split into different files, to better handle complex configuration scenarios.</p>



<pre><code>project: my-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: app
from: java:8-jdk-alpine
...
---
{{ include "artifact/appserver.tmpl" . }}</code></pre>



<p>At the same level you can find a <strong>Dockerfile</strong>, used to build the image. This <strong>Dockerfile</strong> can be directly referenced from<strong> werf.yaml </strong>to be used. However, Werf supports custom syntax to build images, directly specified within <strong>werf.yaml</strong> as you will see in the upcoming examples.</p>



<p><strong>.helm</strong> directory contains the Helm charts to be used by Werf to deploy the application, organized following the <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chart-file-structure">Helm chart file structure</a>. Notice that <strong>Chart.yaml</strong> is not included as it is not used by Werf.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Building images 📦</h2>



<p>First, clone the examples repository to get started.</p>



<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds.git
cd werf-kubesandclouds</code></pre>



<p>Building images from a Dockerfile is the easiest way to start using Werf in an already existing project. To do so, you will only need to add the<em> dockerfile </em>directive with the Dockerfile name (Dockerfile in this case) under the image config in your <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file.</p>



<pre><code>project: kyc-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: web-server
dockerfile: Dockerfile</code></pre>



<p>The code below shows the contents of the Dockerfile. It is fairly simple, as it just adds the webpage and its media to the image and exposes the port 80 fort the nginx server to listen on.</p>



<pre><code>FROM nginx:latest

COPY web/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY web/kyc.png /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80 
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</code></pre>



<p>However, Werf provides advanced features for image building, eliminating the need for Dockerfiles, although they can be combined with the Werf builder syntax. Besides, you can build as many different images as you need using just one Werf configuration file (<a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/advanced_build/multi_images.html">multi-image build</a>). The code below shows the contents of the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file of the <a href="https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds">example repository</a>.</p>



<pre><code>project: kyc-project
configVersion: 1

  ENV:
    BUILDER: werf-custom </code></pre>



<p>In this case, the image is built using different Werf directives. First, Ansible syntax is used with the <em>ansible</em> directive, to modify and create some directories. Shell commands can be executed during the building phase with the <em>shell</em> directive, however, when using <em>ansible</em> directives, <em>shell</em> directives cannot be used and vice versa. Notice the commented <em>shell</em> directive as an example.</p>



<p>Blocks inside the <em>ansible</em> and <em>shell</em> directives are known as Werf assembly instructions. Werf provides four user stages for executing these instructions: <em>beforeInstall</em>,&nbsp;<em>install</em>,&nbsp;<em>beforeSetup</em>, and&nbsp;<em>setup</em>. They are executed respectively, one after another. If you want to know more about user stages and the wide range of possibilities they offer, check<a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/assembly_instructions.html#what-are-user-stages"> this documentation</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>git</em> directive is used to add files from the local Git repository into the image, but it can be used to add files from remote repositories too, allowing you to specify the branch, tag or commit to use, as well as path-based filters. Besides, this directive can be used to trigger the rebuilding of images when specific changes are made inside a Git repository. To see a comprehensive description of the directive and its capabilities, check <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/git_directive.html">this documentation</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, the <em>docker</em> directive is used following a Dockerfile-like syntax in order to build the image. You can check the details of this directive <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/docker_directive.html">here</a>.</p>



<p>To build your docker image, you just need to execute the following command within the root level of your repository, so that the CLI can find the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file. Note the <em>–stages-storage</em> flag, which indicates to Werf where to store the built <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/reference/stages_and_images.html#stages">stages</a>, which are the intermediate layers that are used to generate the image. In this case, by using the local flag, Werf will store the stages using the local docker runtime.</p>



<pre><code>werf build --stages-storage :local</code></pre>



<p>During the build process, the different stages are executed and their outputs are shown in the terminal.</p>

<p>Once the image is built successfully, you can push it to an images repository. For this example I used a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Dockerhub</a> public repo for simplicity. If you don’t have an account yet, just sign up and create a public repository. Once it’s ready, generate an access token so that Werf can push the built images to the repository. To push the image, issue the following command.</p>



<pre><code>werf publish --stages-storage :local --images-repo &lt;your-repo&gt;  --tag-custom v0.0.1  --images-repo-docker-hub-token  &lt;your-token&gt;</code></pre>



<div><figure><img src="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM.png 883w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM-300x75.png 300w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM-768x191.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you prefer using a local Docker repository, rather than using Dockerhub, you can just run the following command, and specify <em>–images-repo localhost:5000/your-repo-name</em> when issuing the <em>werf publish</em> command.</p>



<pre><code>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2</code></pre>



<p><strong>TIP 2:</strong> You can build and publish your image by just using one command.</p>

<p>I regularly help pre-seed entrepreneurs identify and evaluate potential startup opportunities. The following is a set of heuristics I’ve developed and collected over the years that might of use.</p>



<p>These heuristics are just a starting point to <strong>identify interesting, unsolved problems</strong> in the world that may turn in to great startups. Entrepreneurs must still go deep on understanding their customers, the business model, have a clear answer to <a href="https://avichal.com/2017/11/27/why-now/">Why Now?</a> there is a big shift in the market, and <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">focus on identifying problems rather than generating ideas that <em>sound</em> good.</a></p>



<ol><li>Tools inside a big company — High growth companies often first experience a problem other companies will soon face and solve it internally. Bringing these tools to everyone else can work well, e.g. Asana was inspired by the Facebook internal tasks tool, Cloudera was inspired by Facebook’s internal data infrastructure. </li><li>Consumer generation shift — Think about a consumer company that started ~7 years ago. Generations shift in about 7-10 years, thus tastes evolve, and platforms shift. Thus there is an opening to acquire customers, e.g. Snapchat started 2011 while Facebook started 2004</li><li>Big company acquisitions — If a company is acquired for $5B+, consider a competitor. This may indicate product maturity, a departure of talent after earnouts, or becoming focused on profits vs. product investment. Now may be a great time to re-imaginge LinkedIn or Github</li><li>Market validation from other startups — Find a company that recently raised a series A and approach solving the problem differently. Often the first company to identify an opportunity will not win but does indicate customers have a real problem they want solved.</li><li>Revisit ideas that were too early — Look back at ideas that were hot 10 years ago because entrepreneurs have a tendency to be too early. See if any might make sense now, e.g. Instacart vs. Webvan.</li><li>Invert a successful company’s core competency — Take the core strength of a company and flip it on its head to see what a product experience may be if you did the opposite, e.g. Snapchat was based on ephemerality and Facebook based on permanence of identity, or Southwest was based on a point-to-point model with only one type of plane whereas other airlines use a hub and spoke model with multiple types of planes.</li><li>Extend consumer behaviors to businesses — Take a product used by consumers and think about how it might apply to prosumers, enterprises, and small businesses, e.g. LinkedIn vs Facebook.</li><li>Turn open source projects in to SAAS businesses — Find open source projects that are very popular and turn these in to out of the box services for enterprises, e.g. PagerDuty is like Nagios.</li><li>Compete with old world industries using software — Find an industry that is resistant to using software and build a vertically integrated version to compete with that industry, e.g. Atrium vs. law firms.</li><li>Low NPS, fragmented industries — Identify a large, a highly-fragmented industry with terrible net-promoter-score and build a modern, software-first version of their product, e.g. OpenDoor (credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois">Keith Rabois</a> for this one) </li><li>Make things programmable — Take a desktop utility, move it online, and make it more powerful by making it more programmable, e.g. Airtable and Notion (similar to <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/01/interesting-markets-2019-edition.html">Elad Gil’s idea around devsumers</a>)</li><li>Unbundle a company — Look at the functions of modern companies and unbundle them to make them available for companies of all sizes, e.g. WeWork is the unbundled facilities group at most big companies</li><li>Look to engineers’ hobbies — Figure out where hobbyist engineers are spending their spare time and how to productize that (<a href="http://cdixon.org/2013/03/03/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years/">Chris Dixon’s idea</a>)</li><li>Understand how teens communicate — Figure out where teenagers are spending their time to see what the communication products of the next decade may be. Teens are unencumbered and very creative, so seek to understand the motivations instead of judge.</li><li>Travel and observe non-software solutions — Travel to new places to discover non-software solutions that other countries/people/markets have come up with to various problems, e.g. I was in Moscow in 2006 and people could just hail any stranger on the street to drive them somewhere like a cab. It may not have been a big leap if you saw this behavior to Uber/Lyft on your phone.</li><li>Look at behaviors in certain geographies — Smaller, homogenous culture countries (Sweden, Korea, Japan) are early adopters of many technologies. Spend time there to understand what they are doing that isn’t globally popular yet, e.g. watching other people play video games or mobile payments took off in these markets very early relative to the US.</li><li>Unbundle the government — Think about what services the government offers and how you might build a profitable business model around these, perhaps even by offering these services in a more cost-effective way back to the government, e.g. SpaceX is a private NASA, FedEx is a private postal service.</li><li>Verticalize an already successful business — Find a massively successful business such as Salesforce and target it for a vertical that is traditionally challenging to access, e.g. Veeva is a pharma industry specific CRM worth $15B+ and raised only $7M in funding.</li><li>Build something for a distribution channel — Identify a new distribution channel that would enable access to a new customer, and then think through what that customer wants that the distribution channel does not want to provide, e.g. Pinterest and Yelp built on SEO, Paypal built on eBay, YouTube embedded inside MySpace before MySpace had a video product.</li><li>Draft on a regulatory shift — Build behind a big regulatory shift to compete with large incumbents who will be slow to move and have regulatory + technical baggage, e.g. Oscar Health after Obamacare. I’m sure some companies will spin up to help people transition to a post-GDPR world.</li></ol>



<p>I’m sure there are other good heuristics to use as a starting point. If anyone sends me others, I’ll add them to my blog post as a reference for others.</p>

		<p>I love my two cats dearly and they bring a lot of joy to my life, but they also bring other things, like poop, and fur.&nbsp; When I tried to research mitigations for any of these it was 100% SEO listicles, so I’m sharing my raw data in the hopes that the next person can find something real-if-incomplete instead of a list of every automated litter box that has ever been manufactured.</p>
<p>I wrote the bulk of this in February, but then one of the cats developed dermatitis and I put it on pause until I could make sure it wasn’t caused by anything on this list. Alas, it wasn’t, she’s just allergic to my new apartment. But then I wanted to test something else, and suddenly six months had passed. So if the tenses seem weird, that’s why.</p>
<p>(Links are affiliate links when possible)</p>

<p>I screwed up choosing my new apartment (this was written before the allergy thing). I remembered to check for space to put the litter box in the bathroom, but in my joy at finding a place that allowed that at all after so many that did not,&nbsp; I forgot to check if that space was also where you stood to wash your hands. So I ended up having to put the box in the living room. I’ve done that before and didn’t want to go back to having to keep the window open year round and still smelling poop. I also didn’t love the aesthetic.&nbsp; So I set up something kind of elaborate.</p>
<h2><a href="https://kittyvent.com/products/kitty-vent">KittyVent Litter Box Ventilator</a></h2>
<p>This is a long piece of hosing with a gentle fan in it, and a plastic thingy to block off a window that has a hole for the hose to connect to (similar to what you’d use for a portable air conditioner)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2969/4434/products/IMG_0842_075fb887-2c88-400b-9bc8-3973573e3915_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1545953794" width="423" height="282"></p>
<p>The window-blocking thing works vertically but won’t stay up on its own, I had to tape it. The fan is extremely quiet, you can’t tell it’s on from more than six inches away. I’m very sure it works because the first time I noticed a smell, I found the fan had been turned off.</p>
<p>There are instructions for how to DIY this available online (e.g. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Cat-Litter-Box-Odor-Eliminator-Fan-FlowCat/">here</a>), but I just bought it and it worked fine.</p>
<h2>Litterbox Holding End Table</h2>
<p>To make it less hideous, I got an end table designed to hold a litter box. Amazon is full of these, but most have only a single entrance and no ventilation. I assume these are aimed at people who haven’t thought things through. I wanted something I could connect a vent to and actually get rid of the smell. You might be able to cut a hole in one of the ventless ones to attach the hose to but I didn’t feel like bothering, so I got one with ventilation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iP7ZrigoL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="443" height="420"></p>
<p>I chose ecoFlex (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BM8E4KK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BM8E4KK&amp;linkId=12a658675d21d4d4f9cad298d5ba2314">affiliate link</a>)&nbsp; because matched my it existing furniture and was the only option with both ventilation holes and a second shelf. For this, I accepted it being really much larger than it needed to be. Also the copytext said something about liquid-proof, non-smell-absorbant material, although who knows how true that is. Then I packing taped the ventilation hose to a hole in the back that wasn’t shown in the pictures, apparently intended for electric cords to automated litter boxes.</p>
<p>My cats adapted stupidly well to this- when I set up the litter box with the door open, they both used it within 10 minutes, despite their other litter box still being available. They did just as well when I closed the door.</p>
<p>Some litter does escape the table, so have a plan for that.</p>
<h2>Dog Poop Bags</h2>
<p>My weird conservation instincts push me not to empty the litter box until I can fill a bag. Otherwise I’m wasting valuable bag. So I bought a bunch of very small, very cheap bags and stored them in that shelf in the litter box end table, which is why I wanted it so much. I chose Amazon Basics Dog Poop Bags (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NABTGY2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NABTGY2&amp;linkId=4d1641dea9b445b48539e119879ecada">affiliate link</a>) based on WireCutter’s <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dog-poop-bags/">recommendation</a> and so far they are resoundingly fine.</p>
<h2>Dr Esley Cat Litter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9WFY14/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07L9WFY14&amp;linkId=37e0a6f0fb2ce49f0ba47c52c36791d7">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I got this because Sweethome recommended it. I didn’t appreciate how much better it was working until a delivery screw up made me use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZYMWVT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06ZZYMWVT&amp;linkId=e9f8cccc7ed36fc1765011ac565da4d4">Arm and Hammer</a> and there started to be a smell where there hadn’t been before.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-3.html">Litter Robot 3</a></h2>
<p>This is so close to being a truly great product, but isn’t quite reliable enough to be the only litter box. It had a tendency to get stuck in an unusable position, which eventually forces the cats to go elsewhere. The drawer the poop stays in doesn’t completely contain the smell. Also the range of litter between “excess will get dumped” and “too low” is uncomfortably thin. I’d still recommend it as a second litter box to cut down on scooping, or in a populous household where there will always be someone to turn it off and on again.</p>
<h2>Two Layer Litter Mat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G67FD6W/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00G67FD6W&amp;linkId=9e1bbec26c9a003b834013f6cbb1bc7d">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BjAf-AA6L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"></p>
<p>This actually worked great at its stated purpose of catching litter the cats track out of the box, but when the cats pooped on it (say, because the litter box had been upside down for six hours), it was almost impossible to clean, especially if I caught it less than instantly. Plus it is ugly.</p>
<h2>Open Window with a Fan</h2>
<p>This was definitely better than not having an open window with a fan, but there’s no comparison between it and the vent-with-hose.</p>


<h2>Silicone Grooming Gloves (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9KSITZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9KSITZ&amp;linkId=cf4e5b0147e03c93e42da573c5afaf32">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713JHXyZS9L._AC_SL1000_.jpg" width="356" height="321"></p>
<p>These collect a lot of hair, plus their squishiness means you can brush bony areas that would be a problem for a metal comb. The cats start purring the instant I pet them with these.</p>
<p>Downside: kind of a pain to get the hair off the glove, does not pick up 100% of the fur it loosens, so be sure to use it somewhere easy to vacuum or at least not your own lap.</p>

<h2>The Dryer</h2>
<p>Turns out dryers are reasonably good at removing cat hair if you wait long enough. Remember to clean the lint trap frequently.</p>
<h2>Reusable Lint Roller</h2>
<p>I tried two made of the same material- a paddle shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBM761G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07SBM761G&amp;linkId=94a8f23a77ace6722af2df51d72f696b">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dh0-dIIwL._SL1467_.jpg" width="341" height="324"></p>
<p>and a more traditional roller shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BAGTNAQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00BAGTNAQ&amp;linkId=cb9987743b51a7b5feea72739bf6ac92">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VbLSzuCrL._SL1500_.jpg" width="340" height="272"></p>
<p>Of these, I found the wand shaped one easier to use, and the roller easier to clean. I prioritized use, but your mileage may vary. Also, you need to actually read the instructions on how to use it, running it back and forth like disposable lint roller just redistributes the hair.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a pillow after I ran the paddle shaped one over part of it several times. I think this gives a good idea of what it’s capable of, i.e. it’s a significant improvement but doesn’t get everything.</p>

<p>Note: inbetween writing this and publishing, the paddle brush people offered me actual money to publish a review, which I plan on taking them up on, assuming I can find the form.</p>
<h2>Shark Pet-Perfect II Handheld Vacuum (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037HHFMO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0037HHFMO&amp;linkId=4140bcc636b3132e9c69552f56ebb21e">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>Sweethome’s top handheld vacuum pick was sold out everywhere and their second is specifically called out as being bad at fur, so I selected based on Amazon reviews. As a vacuum cleaner it is Not Fucking Around- it is super powerful and sucks anything off my floors. It advertises a special whirling brush aimed specifically at pet hair, but I found it choked on soft surface I tried it on, and the bristles were better. The biggest complain on Amazon was the battery life, but I got it for spot cleaning not marathons, so it’s been fine and I appreciate not paying for a feature I don’t use.</p>
<p>All of the anti-cat-hair devices work better if I stay very on top of them. Given time, the fur works itself deeper into the fabric and nothing will work except picking it out with actual human fingers.</p>

<p>This is another one that was great at its official objective but failed a secret objective. It was absolutely amazing at removing fur from the cats (on areas broad and unbony enough to support the comb), and they liked it, but it left them less soft. I did not get these cats to have them at less than their maximum softness.</p>

<p>I ran an experiment and as far as I can tell these are no better than just running an article through the dryer. Before/after photos (which I unfortunately didn’t save) didn’t show more hair being removed and the thingies are completely free of hair after many uses, which suggests to me they’re not helping much.</p>
<p>I tried wetting them and running them over a pillow case and they indeed picked up something, so I’m leaving them in my washer just in case.</p>
<p>I used LEADTEAM (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THZ68TT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07THZ68TT&amp;linkId=8efe81ab9e97d47fa558f5f04ff3d1f9">affiliate link</a>) and didn’t test any others, they looked identical.</p>

<p>Testing the dryer inserts is difficult because it’s really hard to get a control group. I can’t put in half a blanket and see what the other half does. I can’t even use my two identical blankets, because they’re not guaranteed to have identical amounts of hair on them. I tried with socks but was kind of out of patience by that point. I was pretty confident the rubber ones were doing nothing, but despite a really silly amount of rigor involving photos and test swabs with the lint roller, I just can’t tell with these.</p>
<h2>Disposable Lint Rollers</h2>
<p>These were better than nothing but not as good as the reusable roller.</p>

<p>My cats were never great at eating but had gotten to the point where between the two of them someone was vomiting almost every day without cause (cause = “I went too long without eating”, “I ate too fast because I went too long without eating” and hairballs), and one had lost a noticeable amount of weight (her current weight would be fine if she’d started there, but losing almost 20% of her body weight for no known reason is concerning). There was also behavior that made me think they didn’t like their food- things like persistently begging and then when I put new food down, sniffing it, looking upset and begging more. So I talked to the vet.</p>
<h2>Prescription Food and/or B12 vitamins (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MWKYP86/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MWKYP86&amp;linkId=8707696381553f9939f9fdf6dda878ff">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I started both of these at the same time and now the cats are down to vomiting once a week, tops, some of which is for cause. They don’t love the prescription food by they will eat it. They’re fine with the vitamins.</p>
<p>In terms of specific brands:</p>
<ul>
<li>They hate <a href="https://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/products/vet-products/feline-selected-protein-adult-pd-canned-cat-food">Royal Canin Duck and Pea protein</a>. When I included this in their diet they ate only two cans of food per day (one Royal Canin, one of their old food, Friskies), which is little enough that the already-underweight one was losing …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at daemons. We’ll understand exactly what they are, how they’re implemented, and the scope of their responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put, a daemon (pronounced dee-mon) is an intentionally orphaned background process. Additionally, daemons are detached from the terminal in which they’re spawned, operate without user interaction, and are descendants of the system’s init process.</p>



<p>Daemons will silently wait in the background for specific events to occur or conditions to be met before executing.</p>



<p>At boot time, Linux will start the init process (init is itself a daemon) which will serve as the parent of all processes and assign it PID 1 (process identification number). It’s important to mention that the init function is a special process that is not attached to any terminal.</p>



<p>After the boot sequence is complete, Linux will start up any previously declared daemons. These will be created through a series of fork() and exit() commands which will intentionally create an orphaned process that will eventually be adopted by the init process – more on this soon.</p>



<h2><strong>Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>Conventionally, daemon process names end with the letter “d”. If you’re interested in seeing all daemons installed on your Linux machine, use this command:</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<p>You’ve certainly encountered daemons whether you were aware of them or not:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A web server is simply a process that runs continuously in the background waiting to process and respond to HTTP requests (http daemon)</li><li>sshd is the dameon responsible for SSH operations</li><li>“MAILURE_DEMON” is a daemon that notifies the sender of invalid email recipients&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring hardware activity like hard drive health&nbsp;</li><li>cron jobs</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll take a look at the code to create a daemon shortly, but let’s establish some basics first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calling the fork() function creates a new process referred to as the child process. The child process runs in parallel with the process that triggered the fork() (the parent process).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A child process shares the same program counter and CPU registers as its parent. So, when a new child process is created, both the child and parent processes will execute the next instruction after the fork() call in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a simple example from Michigan Tech:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q9blfMxaFBFWjoLw_h9HxBAJYRhW5WO6ws4atHZKsY-6Bf5y9bu-EBQJ7qJ8F_piFCvK6wct0U-l9ykXRpt1DZZy_XdJZRCjnjx7WNjLpQu8sx59rsdAxQ25y-PGCJdGJ_VvpzwL" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>After fork(), both the parent and the child processes execute the following code in parallel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OeO_ztEonrxuE5Lw-N_7YS-3gOl0G0h8lQHUdax3632W6aooeiDSf7wOBIGU1aqyF_yCs6hnHv1IqJxtreeTsS_mkdukzMqcfbw2wPp_eEisclimHbtDUC45tetfvxQ_moeOVIvb" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>You can also make their execution paths differ if desired. If the fork() call succeeds, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a daemon, we’ll fork() to create a child process and then exit() the parent. This, as previously mentioned, will purposefully create an orphaned process that will be adopted by init. </p>



<p>Our new daemon is now free to sit silently in the background outside of any terminal and perform its task.</p>



<p>While this is a practical understanding, the actual implementation is a bit more nuanced. </p>



<p>We’ll need to make sure to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Close all open file descriptors</li><li>Change the working directory</li><li>Separate from the terminal and ignore I/O signals</li><li>Disassociate from the process group and control terminal</li><li>Don’t reacquire a control terminal </li><li>Reset the file access creation mask</li></ul>



<p>The following implementation is inspired by Pascal Werkl’s work. I’ve added additional documentation to make it more approachable for someone that is unfamiliar with C and/or Linux systems. I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/pasce/daemon-skeleton-linux-c/">checkout the original code here</a>.</p>







<h2>Understanding the double fork()</h2>



<p>Let’s try and understand why we need 2 fork() calls in the code above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we run this program in the terminal, several environmental settings – specifically the shell we’re working in – are replicated to our child process. So, we’ll need to disassociate our daemon from its spawning terminal.</p>



<p>That’s why we call <code>setsid()</code> and create our own independent session for the child process. </p>



<p>However, in doing so, this child process will be in its own session and process group and therefore it’ll be its own session leader. The main takeaway here is that there is potential for the session leader to reacquire a terminal later on (i..e. if say the user were to open up another terminal). </p>



<p>We don’t want that. Remember, we want to be completely independent of the terminal and any user-input.</p>



<p>By calling fork() a second time, we ensure that this new process (fork-2) will have a PID outside the bounds of fork-1’s session. Since we are not calling <code>setsid()</code> on the fork-2 process, no new session is being made. In other words, we know that fork-2 is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a session leader and therefore there’s no risk of it acquiring a terminal in the future. </p>



<p>Finally, by killing fork-2’s parent, we know that we’ve created an orphaned process that is adopted by init and can’t reacquire a terminal or be affected by user input.</p>



<blockquote><p>TLDR: The 2 fork() calls removes any chance of the daemon reacquiring a controlling terminal and helps ensure that the daemon is re-parented onto init. </p><p>If the use of the secondary fork() isn’t clear, don’t worry – it’s more to do with handling a potential edge case in the environment than a necessity in a generic daemon implementation.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>â€˜Just a second. I just need to respond to this one thing,â€™ I said to my daughter, as I attended to my iPhone.</p>
<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So The Register managed to incite a lot of discussion with a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/">headline</a>
that plain-text e-mail is a barrier to entry for kernel development. While
attention grabbing, this is actually not a new debate. Like a lot of tech
arguments this one seems to come up on a cyclical basis. Maybe because
maintainer summit didn’t happen this year it needed to come out elsewhere.
I gave a few thoughts on twitter but this topic really deserves a longer
look at the problem and what e-mail being a barrier really means.</p>

<p>Linux celebrated over <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commit-1-million-the-history-of-the-linux-kernel/">one million commits</a>
recently. The Linux Foundation also came out with a report about the
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/08/download-the-2020-linux-kernel-history-report/">history</a>
of kernel development. All of this work was completed with development being
done over e-mail. Clearly e-mail has been a successful method of development
for the past 29 years by many metrics.</p>

<p>So if it’s so successful why consider changing? Part of the answer to this
question lies in not what was accomplished by using e-mail but what was <em>not</em>
accomplished because e-mail was the preferred method of development. I
marked 10 years of being a full-time software professional a few weeks ago.
This was a recent enough time span that I can still remember enough of what
it was like to get started. There were a lot of steps to make sure your
e-mail setup was correct (i.e. plain text and no weird footers). It was a
little tricky but certainly doable. This is where the split comes in: what’s
‘a little tricky’ for one person may prevent someone else from contributing
at all. I was fortunate to have enough general working knowledge of Linux to
debug <code>git-send-email</code> when it didn’t work as well as having a corporate
setup that could actually send plain text e-mail. Google around for how to
set up <code>git-send-email</code> and you’ll see this is a step many people struggle with.</p>

<p>“But if you can’t even set up e-mail should you really be working on the
kernel?” This is unfortunately a common refrain in this discussion. I’d
turn the question on its head: why is setting up e-mail a core skill for
working on the kernel? There’s a lot of value in learning and following
community norms but what value does <em>that</em> particular norm bring? I’d argue
that showing you can set up and use plain text e-mail does not make you
a better kernel programmer. Supporting tooling for a project is important
but there’s nothing inherent to e-mail that makes it a good indicator of
anything. People can only handle keeping track of so many things at once.
Having to figure out plain text e-mail is one more task on the stack.
Reducing the overhead in mental load to participation lets people focus
much more on the actual kernel work. We can maintain tools that take less
work to run. Yes, the initial SMTP configuration is a one time setup but
sending out a patch each time with <code>git-send-email</code> involves a lot of manual
steps. Even if you get the manual steps right there’s always the chance
that your e-mail will be rejected due to over zealous spam filtering. There
was a three month period or so where all my e-mails to a particular maintainer
were being rejected because my 3rd party SMTP server had ended up on a spam
blocklist.</p>

<p>“But you can automate e-mail to do the manual parts” To some degree yes but
this is hard to do across the entire tree. The kernel has very few unifying
standards so for those who work across multiple areas you’re usually left
making a best educated guess about where things should go. MAINTAINERS is a
good start but it’s not always complete. And even if you <em>can</em> automate
everything expecting every contributor to come up with their own automation
is not a good use of time. “So provide everyone the automation” and there in
lies the problem: the fact that everyone can use their own setup is seen
as an advantage so it’s impossible to give something that works for everyone.
Even trying to guess what would be the most common setup to give some baseline
hasn’t been a fruitful conversation.</p>

<p>“So GitHub is the answer to our problems?” I’m not saying that either.
“kids these days are using GitHub so we should switch too” is a very weak
argument. Familiarity with a tool is a factor but it shouldn’t be the biggest
factor. Everyone, new and experienced developers, can learn new tools. If I
thought that e-mail was a suitable tool I would be promoting it as something
newer developers should learn. Compare that with git which both new and
experienced people will tell you can be difficult to use. It <em>is</em> worthwhile
to learn git though and there’s been some improvement in UX recently
(<code>git switch</code>). One objection to GitHub is the fact that it’s a proprietary
platform. I’m not willing to entertain conspiracy theories about GitHub
being owned by Microsoft and therefore wanting to destroy the Linux kernel
but before committing to any cloud platform it’s important to do due diligence.
Part of the concern about the ‘forge’ nature of GitHub is that it ends
up being an single point of failure. Anyone who has tried to get work done
when its down will know what a pain this is. The issue is that despite the
fact that git is a distributed version control system you end up needing
to host your repositories <em>somewhere</em> for pull requests to be useful. Anything
that’s useful is going to end up being popular so you’re going to end up
with more points of failure. “What if we all just hosted our own git trees”
running infrastructure takes time, energy, and money, it’s really nice to
not have to think about things like that.</p>

<p>“But e-mail is so much better for discussion and patch review” it’s hard
to differentiate sometimes between “better because I’m more familiar with it”
and “better because it has features I care about”. Is the experience of
reviewing code in GitHub identical to reviewing code in e-mail? No. The
steps are different. It’s never going to match 1-to-1. Do I think code
review in GitHub is usable? Absolutely. Would I take GitHub review over
e-mail? Unclear mostly because it’s hard for me to separate everything else
I hate about e-mail patches from the review part. One nice advantage of
GitHub is that it is incredibly easy to jump in on threads without having
subscribed to the thread first. <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html">lore.kernel.org</a>
has improved the experience of replying via e-mail significantly by providing
instructions and download links but it’s not as easy as point and click.
lore.kernel.org has also improved the archiving experience significantly
which was another area of concern with e-mail. Even with a proper archiving
system, discussion is still disconnected from both bug reporting and the
code review with e-mail. E-mail is really a lousy bug reporting system
simply because it’s easy for things to get lost. “You can filter e-mail”
yes, if you know what to filter on. Again, everyone having bespoke artisinal
e-mail filters doesn’t actually solve the problem. Having a distinct
separation between bug reports and new code is much easier to keep straight.
I also grow weary of having to explain to new contributors that LKML is
mostly just an archive and sending anything to LKML without another cc is
probably not going to get a response (a great way to discourage contributors).
Again, there is documentation out there to explain how to contribute but it
doesn’t actually <em>need</em> to be this complicated.</p>

<p>“GitHub could never scale to the volume of the Linux Kernel” This is an
interesting point. There was some discussion on twitter about monorepos.
The kernel does appear to be unique in terms of number of contributors and
volume of commits. Maybe GitHub can’t actually scale. That shouldn’t mean
the only option ever is e-mail. Git itself came out of a need for a version
control system that matched what the kernel needed (we’ll ignore other
parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a> saga).
The scaling issue often comes up when discussing CI. Those outside the
kernel community are somewhat shocked and appalled about how much manual
work happens. <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a> has come a long
way in integrating CI as part of the regular development process. It’s not
clear if a traditional CI system like GitHub offers would even make sense.
For one, testing kernels requires either physical machines to test on or
a virtual environment, neither of which are particularly standard for setups
like GitHub. The kernel is also (intentionally) designed to work on an
incredibly wide variety of hardware. Testing every commit against all
possible hardware is next to impossible. Even choosing a limited set of hardware
can quickly create a bottleneck for getting anything merged. KernelCI has
done a great job trying to balance coverage and speed. Part of the issue
with the scaling argument is that it’s a bit of chicken and egg to determine
if something like GitHub would actually scale. We can’t switch over because
we are concerned it might not scale but we can’t really know if it scales
until we switch over. The kernel likes small incremental changes but switching
development workflows may be impossible to do incrementally.</p>

<p>Plain text e-mail may not be the biggest barrier for many people wanting
to do kernel development but it can still be one. There are plenty of reasons
to want something better than e-mail for development. There may be some
reasons to stay on e-mail because no better tool exists but “lowering the
bar” or other gatekeeping nonsense is not among the reasons. I personally
eagerly await the day I don’t have to think about e-mailing patches.</p>

                      Psychiatry appointments on average are $400+/hr.
                      </p><p>
                      Our initial appointments are $199. They last just 25 minutes since our providers review your information and think about your medical history ahead of time. The initial appointment is for listening to you, crafting a treatment plan together, and reviewing your goals. We don't waste your time.
                      </p><p>
                      After the initial appointments, our membership is just $59/mo. The membership includes follow-up appointments, access to our care team and providers, and convenient online refills. You may not require an appointment each month, but our providers will still review your medical history and progress that you may submit in order to issue an online refill.
                      </p><p>
                      Treatment costs are not included in these prices. Out of pocket costs for the treatment (without insurance) range from $40-80/mo. With insurance, it's just the copay.
                      </p><p>
                      We do not accept insurance for appointments or membership.

                      <br>Fill out and submit the medical questionnaire on the home page. Please answer truthfully as your provider will use your responses to understand your medical condition.
                      </p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong>
                      <br>After submitting the form, you may schedule an appointment directly with a provider of your choice.

                      <br>If treatment is issued, we can arrange to have it shipped to you for free. Or, if you prefer picking it up at a local pharmacy, you may ask your provider to send it there by providing the name, phone number, and address of the location.
                      </p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong>
                      <br>Now that your initial consultation is complete, you may become a member for just $59/mo.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><div><p>Joshua Mitchell / <!-- -->September 02, 2020</p></div><p>6 min read</p></div></div><p><span>Photo by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unsplash.com/@cgower?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Christopher Gower</a> <!-- -->on<!-- --> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/office-job?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span></p><p>I had a serious case of the Mondays today (08/31/2020), so I figured Iâ€™d write about why I dislike 9-5 office jobs, how Iâ€™m coping with it, and what a better future might look like.</p><h2 id="why-i-dislike-working-a-regular-job"><p>Why I Dislike Working a Regular Job<a aria-label="anchor" href="#why-i-dislike-working-a-regular-job">#</a></p></h2><p>Three reasons: calendar entropy, the on-call nature of the work day, and separation from the real world.</p><ol><li>Calendar entropy</li></ol><p>I prefer long blocks of time to concentrate. Unfortunately, there are only two ways for that to happen on a work day: having all your meetings in the morning, or all in the afternoon. Most of the time, it doesnâ€™t work that way (see: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aatishb.com/entropy/">entropy</a>).</p><p>This is bad (for me) for 2 reasons:</p><ul><li>Like Paul Graham said in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a>, it takes time to get in the zone. The shorter each block of time to work, the larger percentage of time getting started, and the less total time spent moving the needle.</li><li>Getting into the zone is less enjoyable than being in the zone. If most of the time is spent getting in the zone, then the activity is overall less enjoyable. If itâ€™s less enjoyable, then that also makes it harder to get started later.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>On-call nature</li></ol><p>You can get away with ignoring some emails and set up sophisticated filters for others but, at the end of the day, your inbox is a to-do list you donâ€™t control. Itâ€™s also dynamic, which means you have to keep an eye on it.</p><p>In that sense, I am on-call. Thus, I have a baseline level of anxiety that I'll be pulled out of the zone (or miss an email and irritate someone). That anxiety is heightened by that stupid red dot on the chat icon that never goes away, no matter how many times you check it.</p><ol start="3"><li>Separation from the real world</li></ol><p>Businesses, in order to make a profit, have to be efficient. Hence, each part of the business (particularly each employee) tends towards specialization. The chaos of reality is subdued by categories and protocols. Unless you're at the front lines (e.g. as a sales person or customer service), only a few nitty-gritty pieces of â€œthe real worldâ€� make it down the pipeline to you. Itâ€™s easy to forget that the customers even exist. Working like this feels sterile - like filling out a form at the DMV.</p><p>This is, selfishly, why I don't like donating money to charities. I'm too detached from the process and outcome. It feels like I'm just tossing money into a black hole.</p><h2 id="how-im-coping"><p>How Iâ€™m Coping<a aria-label="anchor" href="#how-im-coping">#</a></p></h2><p>The company environment and processes are difficult for a person at the bottom of the totem pole (i.e. me) to influence, but it's important to note that they're not the problem per se. There is really one core problem: getting past the emotional friction (from the reasons earlier) in order to actually start.</p><p>I've found that a workaround solution is simply removing AS MUCH ambiguity as possible. For any task that I am assigned, I try to make sure I don't walk away without knowing two things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is brain-dead step 1</strong>? When I say brain-dead, I want to be able to accomplish the task absolutely wasted drunk. For example, "start reading ABC documentation" is not specific enough. I need something like</p><ul><li>open up the Chrome browser</li><li>go to X URL</li><li>press Y menu button</li><li>click Z option</li></ul></li></ol><p>If I'm fighting lots of psychological resistance, compliance is so much easier if the next step is blatantly obvious and only takes seconds.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Where is the light at the end of the tunnel</strong>? The only thing worse than having trouble getting started is having trouble <em>staying</em> started. I might be able to accomplish the herculean task of getting started, but if I have to keep sustaining that same effort to stay there, I'm basically done for. I need to achieve some degree of flow, and that involves culling ambiguity that could roadblock me.</li></ol><h2 id="a-long-term-solution"><p>A Long Term Solution<a aria-label="anchor" href="#a-long-term-solution">#</a></p></h2><p>Here is an attempt to enumerate my wish list:</p><ul><li>Long periods of uninterrupted time to think.</li><li>Communication with other people (e.g. stakeholders) is predictable and batched.</li><li>A visceral intimacy with my domain (i.e. proximity to â€œthe real worldâ€�).</li></ul><p>By that last bullet, I mean a deep and comprehensive understanding that comes from close attunement and having skin in the game.</p><p>The archetype I'm imagining is a scientist who studies volcanoes. Every once in a while, they take a trip to a volcano to observe it first hand - literally feeling it beneath their feet. However, they don't actually set up their office there, where the scientist is subject to eruptions and other agents of disorder. They go back to their lab, shut the door, and go heads-down examining samples, running simulations, doing math, etc.</p><p>An obvious question: Why not become a scientist?</p><p>I've thought about it, but my biggest problem is that, based on past experience, I don't think it's a good idea for me to commit to spending 4-6 years thinking about 1 thing (i.e. a PhD). I have lots of unfinished projects that I abandoned. Interest was high at first, but waned. Simultaneously, my interest in something else increased, so I jumped ship. Rinse-and-repeat.</p><p>I've tried making myself stay on one path, but it never stuck long term. I've found that it's far more productive for me to do lots of successive short-term projects - for example, blog posts like this one or JIRA tickets as an engineer.</p><p>In any case, my hypothesis right now is that Iâ€™d be most happy providing value to the world by creating content based on whatever has my attention at that time. For example, if Iâ€™m currently entransed by Chapter 13 of some math textbook, then maybe I could whip up a blog post explaining it. I could make it more attractive by adding interactive dials for user experimentation and/or some copy pertaining to why itâ€™s important. Iâ€™m not sure I could make a living off that, though. Plus, Iâ€™m happy that Iâ€™m at least doing work thatâ€™s meaningful, even if it doesn't feel that way.</p><br></article></div>]]>

He pointed out that globally&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2018/05/18/gains-in-financial-inclusion-gains-for-a-sustainable-world?cid=ECR_TT_worldbank_EN_EXT" target="_blank">1.7 billion people</a>&nbsp;don’t have a bank account but about two-thirds of them have mobile phones.</p><p>Mobile money transfer companies like M-Pesa are engaged in wide-scale mobile phone-based money transfering, financing, and micro-financing services. So this led to a surge in “digital credit” banking led by the private sector in low-income countries, which is increasing financial inclusion for people without formal credit.</p><p>China takes this up a notch with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smartcitylab.com/blog/inclusive-sharing/can-big-data-eradicate-poverty/" target="_blank">a cloud computing platform to monitor the financial health of 6 million people living in poverty in 9,000 villages in Guizhou province</a>. In the Tongzi County, the government provided aid for the most disadvantaged groups and created a data platform to monitor the distribution of these subsidies to prevent embezzlement and fraud.</p><h2 id="1-sdg-2-zero-hunger">SDG 2: Zero Hunger</h2><p>An example of achieving this SDG with Big Data is MEANS database, which uses a system of emails, texts and cloud-based data crunching <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/vmware-2017/hungry-data-science/1796/" target="_blank">to match the right food to the right needy people</a>. The problem that MEANS is attempting to solve is the mismatch of food between what food kitchens and charities need, and what is being given to them.</p><p>For example, 10,000 packets of sugar-laden Pop-Tarts are given to a charity with mostly diabetic members. In cases where large amounts of the wrong food are given to the wrong people, the food end up being disposed and that sucks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

As a result, even scientists in the same general field can have trouble accessing and understanding each other's work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplicity is not incentivized</strong>. More papers to review means journals and conferences take shortcuts when deciding how remarkable a discovery is. Making your discovery seem more innovative and complex can help you get published in the more prestigious journals and conferences.</p></li></ul><p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">metaphor</a> from Chris Olah, a research scientist at Google Brain, on conducting science:</p><p>Achieving a research-level understanding of most topics is like climbing a mountain. Aspiring researchers must struggle to understand vast bodies of work that came before them, to learn techniques, and to gain intuition. Upon reaching the top, the new researcher begins doing novel work, throwing new stones onto the top of the mountain and making it a little taller for whoever comes next.</p><p>Today, the mountains are</p><ul><li><strong>huge</strong> (information overload),</li><li><strong>copious</strong> (knowledge fragmentation), and</li><li><strong>treacherous</strong> (lack of simplicity).</li></ul><p>In general, the journey to become (and stay) a scientist requires sifting through and ingesting far more information. There are several tools, like Google and Wikipedia, that help alleviate this problem but donâ€™t solve it completely.</p><p>So wait, what's wrong with just Googling what you want to find?</p><p>A few things:</p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge duplication is everywhere</strong>. Google can serve millions of results - most of it with overlapping content. This creates noise and makes searching for very specific ideas difficult.</li><li><strong>The relationship between ideas is the most important</strong>. If you want to know how x and y are related, you have to Google "how x and y are related" and hope it exists. It's insufficient to simply Google "x" followed by "y".</li><li><strong>You have to know what youâ€™re looking for</strong> (to some degree). We often either donâ€™t know exactly what we want to find or have ideas that are hard to phrase as a search. Google doesn't support this well.</li><li><strong>Google is optimized for a single errand</strong> â€” not an entire learning journey. Google can bring you to ideas, but not <em>between</em> them.</li></ul><p>And what about Wikipedia?</p><p>Wikipedia does help with 2, 3, and 4, but misses two knowledge graph properties: granularity and normalization.</p><p><strong>Granularity</strong>: Wikipedia is biased towards articles on various subjects - a consistent level of detail. If you just want a summary, itâ€™s too verbose: you wonâ€™t read most of the page. If you want details, itâ€™s too high level: youâ€™ll have to go elsewhere for a more tailored source. With knowledge graphs, you can continuously zoom in and out depending on what level of abstraction you need.</p><p><strong>Normalization</strong>: Part of Wikipediaâ€™s verbosity is due to information duplication. If you go to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig#Health_issues">Wikipedia page on pigs</a>, it tells you that pigs can â€œacquire human influenzaâ€�. You can also find the same information on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza">Wikipedia page about the flu</a>: â€œInfluenza may also affect other animals, including pigs...â€� In one-off use cases, like a quick Google search, this isnâ€™t too big of a deal. However, if youâ€™re traversing from node to node (or page to page), this redundancy becomes a bigger factor and degrades the user experience. By â€œnormalizingâ€� the content (i.e. removing redundancy), that problem is removed.</p><h2 id="an-ideal-solution"><p>An Ideal Solution<a aria-label="anchor" href="#an-ideal-solution">#</a></p></h2><p>Letâ€™s do some brainstorming on qualities this tool would ideally preserve:</p><ul><li>Ideas are atomic. Since theyâ€™ll be building blocks for bigger ideas, they need to be comprehensive, but terse.</li><li>Ideas are referenced multiple times, but live in one place. From a computational point of view, duplication causes anomalies and headaches.</li><li>Ideas can have multiple views. Although each view of an idea is an idea itself, they will all be manifestations of the same core idea. Itâ€™s also possible that a view can have multiple core ideas.</li><li>There is no siloing. If two ideas are related, they will be connected.</li><li>Similar ideas are â€œcloseâ€� to each other (i.e. low degree of separation).</li><li>Searching can be done via traditional means (e.g. keywords and categories), but also through serendipitous traversal.</li></ul><p>Storing knowledge this way can result in a whole range of applications. A few examples:</p><ul><li>Finding ideas becomes more natural: You can just start with the idea you think is most similar, and iterate towards what youâ€™re looking for.</li><li>Digesting ideas becomes more practical: Just look at what ideas itâ€™s composed of and which ideas it has as neighbors.</li><li>If ideas seem terse, itâ€™s likely that different views of it exist and are immediately accessible.</li><li>Automatic generation of books, blog posts, etc, specifically tailored to the reader. How? Just enumerate a specific path through the graph, and you have an outline for the piece!</li></ul><p>To provide a rough sketch of what I have in mind, here's how a portion of such a graph representing programming languages could look like:</p><p>Imagine if every expert built their own knowledge graph with the properties specified beforehand.</p><p>Because of the â€œsingle source of truthâ€� property for every idea, combining them with other knowledge graphs becomes more straightforward. Duplicate ideas are merged, new ideas are coalesced, and contradictory ideas are distilled into commonalities connected by separate branches.</p><p>Eventually, we will have one massive, centralized knowledge graph that the entire world can access.</p><p>Thank you to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://compoundwriting.com/">Compound Writing</a> members who reviewed this post: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lelon.io/blog/joelchristiansen.com">Joel Christiansen</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stewfortier.com/">Stew Fortier</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gridology.co/">Ross Gordon</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://giansegato.com/">Gian Segato</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://junglegym.substack.com/">Nick deWilde</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tomwhitenoise.com/">Tom White</a>, and Michael Shafer.</p><br></article></div>]]>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>
