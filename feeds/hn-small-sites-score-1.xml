November 24, 2020 | https://systemoverlord.com/2016/08/24/posting-json-with-an-html-form.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://systemoverlord.com/2016/08/24/posting-json-with-an-html-form.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A coworker and I were looking at an application today that, like so many other
modern web applications, offers a RESTful API with JSON being used for
serialization of requests/responses.  She noted that the application didn’t
include any sort of CSRF token and didn’t seem to use any of the headers
(X-Requested-With, Referer, Origin, etc.) as a “poor man’s CSRF token”, but
since it was posting JSON, was it really vulnerable to CSRF?  <strong>Yes, yes,
definitely yes!</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, this is reminiscent of many of the confusions between server and
browser that are described in Michal Zalewski’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2QyTUaH">The Tangled
Web</a>.</p>

<p>The idea that the use of a particular encoding is a security boundary is, at
worst, a completely wrong notion of security, and at best, a stopgap until W3C,
browser vendors, or a clever attacker gets hold of your API.  Let’s examine JSON
encoding as a protection against CSRF and demonstrate a mini-PoC.</p>

<h3 id="the-application">The Application</h3>

<p>We have a basic application written in Go.  Authentication checking is elided
for post size, but this is <em>not</em> just an unauthenticated endpoint.</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it basically serves a secret number that can be updated via
HTTP POST of a JSON object.  If we attempt a URL-encoded or multipart POST, the
JSON decoding fails miserably and the secret remains unchanged.  We must POST
JSON in order to get the secret value changed.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-options">Exploring Options</h3>

<p>So let’s explore our options here.  The site can locally use AJAX via the
XMLHTTPRequest API, but due to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">Same-Origin
Policy</a>,
an attacker’s site cannot use this.  For most CSRF, the way to get around this
is plain HTML forms, since form submission is not subject to the Same-Origin
Policy.  The W3C had a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-json-forms/">draft specification for JSON
forms</a>, but that has been abandoned
since late 2015, and isn’t supported in any browsers.  There are probably some
techniques that can make use of Flash or other browser plugins (aren’t there
always?) but it can even be done with basic forms, it just takes a little work.</p>

<h3 id="json-in-forms">JSON in Forms</h3>

<p>Normally, if we try to POST JSON as, say, a form value, it ends up being URL encoded,
not to mention including the field name.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;form</span> <span>method=</span><span>'POST'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;input</span> <span>name=</span><span>'json'</span> <span>value=</span><span>'{"foo": "bar"}'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>'submit'</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Results in a POST body of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>json=%7B%22foo%22%3A+%22bar%22%7D
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good luck decoding that as JSON!</p>

<p>Doing it as the form field name doesn’t get any better.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>%7B%22foo%22%3A+%22bar%22%7D=value
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It turns out you can set the enctype of your form to <code>text/plain</code> and avoid the
URL encoding on the form data.  At this point, you’ll get something like:</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we still have to contend with the form field name and the
separator (<code>=</code>).  This is a simple matter of splitting our payload across both
the field name and value, and sticking the equals sign in an unused field.  (Or
you can use it as part of your payload if you need one.)</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it All Together</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;body</span> <span>onload=</span><span>'document.forms[0].submit()'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;form</span> <span>method=</span><span>'POST'</span> <span>enctype=</span><span>'text/plain'</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>name=</span><span>'{"secret": 1337, "trash": "'</span> <span>value=</span><span>'"}'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This results in a request body of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>{"secret": 1337, "trash": "="}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This parses just fine and updates our secret!</p>

<![CDATA[The Curl Web Infrastructure]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The purpose of the <a href="https://curl.se/">curl web site</a> is to inform the world about what curl and libcurl are and provide as much information as possible about the project, the products and everything related to that.</p>



<p>The web site has existed in some form for as long as the project has, but it has of course developed and changed over time.</p>



<h2>Independent</h2>



<p>The curl project is completely independent and stands free from influence from any parent or umbrella organization or company. It is not even a legal entity,  just a bunch of random people  cooperating over the Internet. And a bunch of <a href="https://curl.se/sponsors.html">awesome sponsors</a> to help us.</p>



<p>This means that we have no one that provides the infrastructure or marketing for us. We need to provide, run and care for our own servers and anything else we think we should offer our users.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png" alt="" width="187" height="144" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png 1011w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-200x155.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-450x348.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-768x594.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px"></a></figure></div>



<p>I still do a lot of the work in curl and the curl web site and I work full time on curl, for <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a>. This might of course “taint” my opinions and views on matters, but doesn’t imply ownership or control. I’m sure we’re all colored by where we work and where we are in our lives right now.</p>



<h2>Contents</h2>



<p>Most of the web site is static content: generated HTML pages. They are served super-fast and very lightweight by any web server software.</p>



<p>The web site source exists in the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-www/">curl-www</a> repository (hosted on GitHub) and the web site syncs itself with the latest repository changes several times per hour. The parts of the site that aren’t static are mostly consisting of smaller scripts that run either on demand at the time of a request or on an interval in a cronjob in the background. That is part of the reason why pushing an update to the web site’s repository can take a little while until it shows up on the live site.</p>



<p>There’s a deliberate effort at not duplicating information so a lot of the web pages you can find on the web site are files that are converted and “HTMLified” from the source code git repository.</p>



<h2>“Design”</h2>



<p>Some people say the curl web site is “retro”, others that it is plain ugly. My main focus with the site is to provide and offer all the info, and have it be accurate and accessible. The look and the design of the web site is a constant battle, as nobody who’s involved in editing or polishing the web site is really interested in or particularly good at design, looks or UX. I personally have done most of the editing of it, including CSS etc and I can tell you that I’m not good at it and I don’t enjoy it. I do it because I feel I have to.</p>



<p>I get occasional offers to “redesign” the web site, but the general problem is that those offers almost always involve rebuilding the entire thing using some current web framework, not just fixing the looks, layout or hierarchy. By replacing everything like that we’d get a lot of problems to get the existing information in there – and again, the information is more important than the looks.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-1200x459.png" alt="" width="379" height="145" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-1200x459.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-200x76.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-450x172.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-768x294.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px"></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/05/27/a-new-curl-logo/" data-type="post" data-id="8817">curl logo</a> is designed by a proper designer however (Adrian Burcea).</p>



<p>If you want to help out designing and improving the web site, you’d be most welcome!</p>



<h2>Who</h2>



<p>I’ve already touched on it: the web site is mostly available in git so “anyone” can submit issues and pull-requests to improve it, and we are around twenty persons who have push rights that can then make a change on the live site. In reality of course we are not that many who work on the site any ordinary month, or even year.  During the last twelve month period, 10 persons authored commits in the web repository and I did 90% of those.</p>



<h2>How</h2>



<p>Technically, we build the site with traditional makefiles and we generate the web contents mostly by preprocessing files using a C-like preprocessor called <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/fcpp/">fcpp</a>. This is an old and rather crude setup that we’ve used for over twenty years but it’s functional and it allows us to have a mostly static web site that is also fairly easy to build locally so that we can work out and check improvements before we push them to the git repository and then out to the world.</p>



<p>The web site is of course only available over HTTPS.</p>



<h2>Hosting</h2>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.haxx.se/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haxx_logo_2010.png" alt="" width="288" height="97" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haxx_logo_2010.png 1046w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haxx_logo_2010-200x68.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haxx_logo_2010-450x152.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haxx_logo_2010-768x260.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Haxx_logo_2010-1038x354.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/23/a-server-transition/" data-type="post" data-id="14836">curl web site is hosted</a> on an origin VPS server in Sweden. The machine is maintained by primarily by me and is paid for by <a href="https://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a>. The exact hosting is not terribly important because users don’t really interact with our server directly… (Also, as they’re not sponsors we’re just ordinary customers so I won’t mention their name here.)</p>



<h2>CDN</h2>



<p>A few years ago we experienced repeated server outages simply because our own infrastructure did not handle the load very well, and in particular not the traffic spikes that could occur when I would post a blog post that would suddenly reach a wide audience.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-1200x630.png" alt="" width="242" height="127" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-200x105.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-450x236.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px"></figure></div>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>. Now, when you go to <a href="https://curl.se/">curl.se</a> (or <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/">daniel.haxx.se</a>) you don’t actually reach the origin server we admin, you will instead  reach one of Fastly’s servers that are distributed across the world. They then fetch the web contents from our origin, cache it on their edge servers and send it to you when you browse the site. This way, your client speaks to a server that is likely (much) closer to you than the origin server is and you’ll get the content faster and experience a “snappier” web site. And our server only gets a tiny fraction of the load.</p>



<p>Technically, this is achieved by the name <strong>curl.se</strong> resolving to a number of IP addresses that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast">anycasted</a>. Right now, that’s 4 IPv4 addresses and 4 IPv6 addresses.</p>



<p>The fact that the CDN servers cache content “a while” is another explanation to why updated contents take a little while to “take effect” for all visitors.</p>



<h2>DNS</h2>



<p>When we just recently switched the site over to <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se</a>, we also adjusted how we handle DNS.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.kirei.se/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kirei.png" alt="" width="265" height="117"></a></figure></div>



<p>I run our own main DNS server where I control and admin the zone and the contents of it.  We then have four secondary servers to help us really up our reliability. Out of those four secondaries, three are sponsored by <a href="https://www.kirei.se/">Kirei</a> and are anycasted. They should be both fast and reliable for most of the world.</p>



<p>With the help of fabulous friends like Fastly and Kirei, we hope that the curl web site and services shall remain stable and available.</p>



<p>DNS enthusiasts have remarked that we don’t do DNSSEC or registry-lock on the curl.se domain. I think we have reason to consider and possibly remedy that going forward.</p>



<h2>Traffic</h2>



<p>The curl web site is just the home of our little open source project. Most users out there in the world who run and use curl or libcurl will not download it from us. Most curl users get their software installation from their Linux distribution or operating system provider. The git repository and all issues and pull-requests are done on GitHub.</p>



<p>Relevant here is that we have no logging and we run no ads or any analytics. We do this for maximum user privacy and partly because of laziness, since handling logging from the CDN system is work. Therefore, I only have aggregated statistics.</p>



<p>In this autumn of 2020, over a normal 30 day period, the web site serves almost 11 TB of data to 360 million HTTP requests. The traffic volume is up from 3.5 TB the same time last year. 11 terabytes per 30 days equals about 4 megabytes per second on average.</p>



<p>Without logs we cannot know what people are downloading – but we can guess! We know that the <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html">CA cert bundle</a> is popular and we also know that in today’s world of containers and CI systems, a lot of things out there will download the same packages repeatedly. Otherwise the web site is mostly consisting of text and very small images.</p>



<p>One interesting specific pattern on the server load that’s been going on for months: every morning at 05:30 UTC, the site gets over 50,000 requests within that single minute, during which 10 gigabytes of data is downloaded. The clients are distributed world wide as I see the same pattern on access points all over. The minute before and the minute after, the average traffic rate remains at 200MB/minute. It makes for a fun graph:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1525" height="471" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-24-Fastly-Stats-curl.png" alt=""><figcaption>An eight hour zoomed in window of bytes transferred from the web site. UTC times.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our servers suffer somewhat from being the target of weird clients like <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/09/a-qqgamehall-storm/" data-type="post" data-id="13880">qqgamehall</a> that continuously “hammer” the site with requests at a high frequency many months after we started always returning error to them. An effect they have is that they make the admin dashboard to constantly show a very high error rate.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>The origin server runs Debian Linux and Apache httpd. It has a reverse proxy based on nginx. The DNS server is bind. The entire web site is built with free and open source. Primarily: fcpp, make, roffit, perl, curl, hypermail and enscript.</p>



<p>If you curl the curl site, you can see in response headers that <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/benefits-using-varnish">Fastly uses Varnish</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-content"><p>“Don’t make me think” is a renowned mantra in the world of design, coined by Steve Krug. It has served as a guiding principle in the world of design and UX for twenty&nbsp;years. It teaches us how to create great experiences in a straightforward and accessible manner.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s article, we’d like to look into enterprise design and its peculiarities. It’s essential to underline that the very nature of enterprise UX slightly differs from consumer UX. As a result, some of Krug’s principles must be adjusted when designing enterprise software.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is by no means a refutation of the design principle. Please treat it as a mere asterisk with a fine print at the bottom.</p><h2><strong>Learning curves aren’t inherently bad</strong></h2><p>According to Krug, products that make people think also make people unhappy. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-learning-curve-design-problem-4d4dc2965098">Products with steep learning curves</a> very rarely succeed in the modern business ecosystem. Customers will pretty much always choose the path of least resistance. This isn’t necessarily true of enterprise products.</p><p>Enterprise users are power users — and it’s imperative that we take this into account when designing products for them. They interact with niche software on a daily basis and quite possibly for many years. They know their way around the logic of the products they use.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating an interface that demands some learning results in a steeper learning curve isn’t inherently wrong. It allows users to work more efficiently once they’ve invested a certain amount of time into training and learning.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606137908-figma-shortcuts-cheatsheet-1014x487.jpg?w=900&amp;auto=compress"><figcaption><a href="https://www.figmacrush.com/figma-shortcuts-cheatsheet/">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Take, for instance, products like Figma, Sketch, Adobe Pro, or any other professional software — most of them have a wide array of shortcuts. Features such as shortcuts may take a while to master, but they’ll ensure a significant boost in productivity once learned.&nbsp;</p><h2>Simplify cautiously&nbsp;</h2><p>We’re very well aware of the importance of keeping interfaces simple and obvious. However, it’s essential to keep in mind the complexity of the tasks typically performed in enterprise software. The pursuit for a clean UI could rid users of the vital context necessary to get work done.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, it can be argued that by making the interface too simple, we risk generating friction rather than eliminating it. Let’s envision an interface of a product that displays a wide array of charts and data, like a trading platform.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606138044-image2.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>A professional that regularly interacts with visual data needs immediate access to it at all times. Having to perform extra actions to access vital features is both frustrating and unproductive. And here lies one of the most significant differences between consumer UX and enterprise UX (eUX).&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer UX is really passionate about sleek UIs, while enterprise software must ensure that users are able to do their work comfortably. Therefore, simplified, minimalistic interfaces aren’t really what eUX designers are after.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wizards are cool, but…</h2><p><a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/ux-onboarding">Onboarding your users</a> is a vital step aimed at ensuring optimal user experience. However, while Wizards and guided tours are an excellent solution for casual users, it’s not necessarily the case for power users.&nbsp;</p><p>In both consumer and enterprise UX, designers must aim to develop products that require <a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/stickiness">as little hand-holding as possible</a>. However, simplistic product tours can be… well, simplistic. They often fail to uncover the entire functionality of a product, which is especially relevant for experienced users.&nbsp;</p><p>After running a series of tests, we found out that enterprise users tend to prefer to leave the app or platform for instructions. While this does seem somewhat disruptive to the experience of a product — it is understandable.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606210515-initiative-alladded1-1.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>Off-page instructions can provide more in-depth explanations rather than the ones that are placed on the screen. Compare, for instance, a tool-tip and an article dedicated to a particular function.&nbsp;</p><h2>Plan for non-linear flows&nbsp;</h2><p>When it comes to designing eUX UIs, designers face a truly arduous task of creating complex, non-linear flows. These flows often involve a variety of roles, profile types, responsibilities, kinds of security, and much more. Our goal is to create a consistent and recognizable experience throughout all of these variables.&nbsp;</p><p>The complicated part, however, is not to force users into flows and scenarios. Experts and professional users need that freedom to make decisions and use the platform as they see fit.</p><p>Think of a person that is deeply versed in Microsoft Excel. They’ve been using this software for nearly a decade, and they know it like the back of their hand. More importantly, they have their style of working and solving problems. Limiting such users via linear and rigid flows could defeat the purpose of boosting their productivity.&nbsp;</p><h2>Don’t fix it if it’s not broken</h2><p>Innovation is a crucial element of UX design. We strive to continuously seek new and creative solutions to old problems. Often, we can even choose to be bold and put forth experimental solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when it comes to eUX, we have to be somewhat more conservative and experiment with caution. Enterprise software isn’t quite receptive to design solutions that go against the grain.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the central purpose of such software is to deliver quality work in short amounts of time, “reinventing the wheel” isn’t always a great idea.&nbsp;</p><p>When designing for enterprise, keeping an eye on your competition is even more relevant than in consumer software.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s go back to Excel once more — imagine <a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/website-redesign">you’re trying to reinvent</a> a complex, spreadsheet-based product. You’re looking to change the ways it represents data, or certain actions are performed. While this does sound like a laudable task, the critical question is — why?&nbsp;</p><p>In eUX, the real value of a product is in its unique selling point that is translated via a design that looks familiar and intuitive.&nbsp;</p><p>That is not to say that the light of innovation never shines on enterprise products, but user expectations often trim the lengths we can go.&nbsp;</p><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>In order to reward you, our beloved reader, for making it till the end, we’ve designed a picture that summarizes the arguments in this article. We hope it will come in handy.</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606138895-enterprise-ux-summary.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>While the principles of “don’t make me think” will most likely outlive us, it’s crucial to outline the situations where they can be somewhat amended.&nbsp;</p><p>Enterprise user experience is a slightly more conservative field in terms of design, yet these limitations push us to become even more creative. By operating within these constraints, we have the power to make the future of work exciting and even more promising.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta: In this article, we explore the peculiarities of enterprise user experience design (eUX) through the lens of the “Don’t make me think” principle.&nbsp;</p></article></div>]]>

                                <ul><li>Even if the world were to stop emitting greenhouse gases right now, the Earth would keep warming for centuries, a new study shows.</li>
<li>The researchers suggest <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-to-stop-gobal-warming-plan-carbon-capture-2018-10">sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere</a> and storing it underground — a solution known as carbon capture and storage.</li>
<li>That's considered a type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-how-to-reverse-climate-change-2019-4">geoengineering</a>. Other <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-how-to-reverse-climate-change-2019-4">climate-hacking</a> proposals in the same category are far riskier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gas today, the Earth would continue warming for centuries. Arctic ice and permafrost are already on an irreversible path of melting.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">That's the finding of new research</a> published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The model suggests that even if emissions were to drop to zero this year, global temperatures would ultimately rise to be 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2500 than they were in 1850 (that's 3 degrees Celsius).</p><p>"The tundra will continue to melt over the next 500 years — irrespective of how quickly humanity cuts its greenhouse-gas emissions," Jørgen Randers, the lead author of the new study, told Business Insider.</p><p>That's because climate change is a vicious, self-sustaining cycle: As permafrost thaws, it releases more greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, which sustains warming over time. To stop that cycle, Randers said, we'll need to suck carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere.</p><h2>8 feet of sea-level rise</h2><p>Randers' study modeled the effect of various emissions-reductions scenarios on Earth's climate between 1850 and 2500.</p><p>The data showed that if emissions stopped for good in 2020, sea levels in 2500 would still be more than 8 feet (2.5 meters) higher than in 1850.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fac2eb9b09abb0018626059?format=jpeg" alt="FILE - In this Aug. 16, 2019, photo, large Icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland. The Trump administration is poised to announce an expanded diplomatic presence in Greenland and a new assistance package for the vast island aimed at thwarting growing Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic.

</figcaption></figure><p>To prevent the projected 3-degree-Celsius temperature increase, greenhouse-gas emissions would need to have ceased entirely between 1960 and 1970, the model found. In that sense, Earth blew by a climactic point of no return 50 years ago — before much of the public understood the realities of climate change.</p><p>"Yes, that is an irony," Randers said. "But of course the scientific community knew about global warming already in the 1960s."</p><h2>We need to suck carbon out of the atmosphere</h2><p>The Paris climate agreement was created with the intention to cut greenhouse-gas emissions enough to keep the world's temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. But even if all emissions stopped by 2100, according to Randers' model, sea levels in 2500 would be nearly 10 feet (3 meters) higher than they were in 1850.</p><p>Earth's temperatures are already on track to blow past the Paris agreement's goals. Last year was the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/projected-ranks#:~:text=The%20warmest%20years%20globally%20have,Courtesy%20of%20NOAA%20NCEI.">second warmest on record</a> for surface temperatures and <a href="https://time.com/5765489/ocean-temperatures-warmest-ever/">the hottest ever for oceans</a>. Polar melting is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sea-level-rise-3-feet-in-80-years-un-report-2019-9" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40">on track to raise seas 3 feet by 2100</a> and threatens to displace hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>What's needed, Randers said, is for companies and governments to "start developing the technologies for large-scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."</p><p>In technical terms, that strategy is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). To prevent further warming after emissions have stopped, the new study found, at least 33 gigatonnes (36.5 billion tons) of carbon dioxide would need to be sucked out of the atmosphere each year. That's roughly the total amount of carbon dioxide the global fossil-fuel industry emitted in 2018 (<a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/12/new-global-co2-emissions-numbers-are-they-re-not-good#:~:text=Record%20Carbon%20Dioxide%20Emissions%20in%202018&amp;text=This%20year's%20numbers%20confirm%20their,2017%20to%2036.2%20gigatonnes%20CO20CO2">36 gigatonnes</a>).</p><p>Power plants in the US, Canada, and Switzerland have already started utilizing CCS to lower their emissions. In 2014, the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan became one of the first in the world to successfully use the technology.</p><p>In total, 21 commercial-scale carbon-capture projects are operating around the world, and 22 more are in development, <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture/">according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions</a>. These projects typically store carbon deep underground in depleted oil and gas fields or in bioreactor containers filled with algae that eats carbon dioxide.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fac4783b09abb001862611c?format=jpeg" alt="bioreactor" height="3744" width="4992" charset=""><figcaption>Bioreactors filled with green algae that eats carbon dioxide in Costa de la Luz, Spain.

</figcaption></figure><p>Two US carbon-capture completed in 2017 — <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture/">one in Illinois, one in Texas</a> — can capture 1.1 million and 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide, respectively, per year. But the amount of CO2 that needs to be removed from the atmosphere requires far more plants than any current plans call for.</p><p>"In other words, building 33,000 big CCS plants and keep them running for ever," the study authors wrote.</p><h2>The pros and cons of geoengineering</h2><p>Carbon capture is becoming widely accepted as a safe and potentially effective form of geoengineering. This and other climate interventions are increasingly being floated <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03036-4">by scientists</a> and politicians alike; Andrew Yang, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, suggested <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-thinks-geoengineering-could-lead-to-war-2019-4">budgeting $800 million</a> for further geoengineering research in the US.</p><p>But most climate-hacking proposals would be far riskier than CCS. Take solar geoengineering, for example, which involves injecting aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight back into space. Critics of this idea point out that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01606-0">most models predict</a> the effects of solar geoengineering wouldn't stay localized. If a country decided to independently deploy such measures, varying and unpredictable effects would likely be seen in other spots around the globe.</p><p>Aerosol injections deployed in the southern hemisphere, for instance, could impact ocean temperatures and wind speeds, leading to more hurricanes in the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5c76a74726289812e8235523?format=jpeg" alt="Clouds above earth" height="2848" width="3797" charset=""><figcaption>Subtropical stratocumulus clouds above Earth.

</figcaption></figure><p>"Solar geoengineering has geopolitical ramifications, unlike carbon capture," Juan Moreno-Cruz, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies geoengineering, previously told Business Insider.</p><p>Randers said his study advocates just for carbon capture, not other more experimental forms of geoengineering.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am generally against geoengineering because of its unintended side effects. But if the world continues to delay meaningful and feasible action to phase out fossil fuels, we may have to resort to geoengineering," Randers said.&nbsp;</p><p>As an immediate priority, he added, countries should invest equally in efforts to cut emissions and build more CCS plants.</p><p>"This would be a wonderful task for a government-financed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-2019-1">Green New Deal</a>," he said.</p>

      If silence is golden, speech is silver – and singing the worst.<br>
Singing doesn’t need to be silenced, however, but at the moment the wisest thing is to sing with social distancing in place. The advice comes from aerosol researchers at Lund University in Sweden. They have studied the amount of particles we actually emit when we sing – and by extension – if we contribute to the increased spread of Covid-19 by singing.<br>

  </p><div>
  
  
      
  

            <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>“There are many reports about the spreading of Covid-19 in connection with choirs singing. Therefore, different restrictions have been introduced all over the world to make singing safer. So far, however, there has been no scientific investigation of the amount of aerosol particles and larger droplets that we actually exhale when we sing”, says Jakob Löndahl, associate professor of Aerosol Technology at Lund University.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Aerosols are small airborne particles. To get a better understanding of the amount of aerosols and virus particles we actually emit when we sing, 12 healthy singers and two people with confirmed Covid-19 took part in a research project. Seven of the participants were professional opera singers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The study shows that singing – particularly loud and consonant-rich singing – spreads a lot of aerosol particles and droplets into the surrounding air.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>“Some droplets are so large that they only move a few decimetres from the mouth before they fall, whereas others are smaller and may continue to hover for minutes. In particular, the enunciation of consonants releases very large droplets and the letters B and P stand out as the biggest aerosol spreaders”, says Malin Alsved, doctoral student of Aerosol Technology at Lund University.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>During the research experiments at Lund University’s Aerosol Laboratory, the singers had to wear clean air suits and enter a specially built chamber supplied with filtered, particle-free air. In the chamber, analysis was conducted of the number and mass of particles emitted by singers during breathing, talking, different types of singing and singing with a face mask.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>What they sang was a short and plosive-rich Swedish song, “Bibbis pippi Petter”, which was repeated 12 times in two minutes at constant pitch. The same song was also repeated with the consonants removed, leaving only the vowels. During the song tests, aerosols and larger droplets were measured using strong lamps, a high-speed camera and an instrument that can measure very small particles. The louder and more powerful the song, the greater the concentration of aerosols and droplets.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>“We also carried out measurements of virus in the air close to two people who sang when they had Covid-19. Their air samples contained no detectable amount of virus, but the viral load can vary in different parts of the airways and between different people. Accordingly, aerosols from a person with Covid-19 may still entail a risk of infection when singing”, says Malin Alsved.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</div>


<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Can we still have choral singing, singalongs during concerts, chanting at sporting events and loud talk in bars? The researchers consider that if we have a good understanding of the risks involved when a group of people sing together, we can also sing in a safer way. The song can be sung with social distancing, good hygiene and good ventilation, which reduces the concentration of aerosol particles in the air. Face masks can also make a difference.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>“When the singers were wearing a simple face mask this caught most of the aerosols and droplets and the levels were comparable with ordinary speech”, says Jakob Löndahl.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>“Singing does not need to be silenced, but presently it should be done with appropriate measures to reduce the risk of spreading infection”, says Jakob Löndahl.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div role="main"> <div>   <article> <p><em>A lot</em> of my time nowadays is captured by the newsfeeds on platforms like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>,<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I don’t hate the fact that I’m a bit addicted to their streams, I mostly consume interesting and informative software-centric content, but I have find myself wanting more powerful information filtering tools. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_filtering_system">Information Filtering</a> (IF) as a consumer technology seems to have either fallen out of vogue or never gotten into it, but I’d argue that strong IF tooling is becoming more and more needed by users to ensure their personal happiness and effectiveness. Currently, the world’s information geysers, great aggregators like Facebook, Google, RenRen, and Toutiauo have misaligned incentives with their users. Despite billions in recommender engine research, today’s production recommender systems are still inadequate. Further, the dominance of <em>implicit</em> signals in user profiling have seen the great aggregators serving the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"><em>Instant Gratification Monkey</em></a> inside us, or the <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/7/7a/Io_Anger_standard2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20150425021210"><em>Anger Golem</em></a>. In the absence of these problems, ie. in a system where the great aggregators are ‘perfect information retrievers’, personal IF tooling is not so much needed. But until then, it’s a thing we should begin to consider more seriously.</p> <h3 id="can-i-just-tell-you-what-i-want">Can I just tell you what I want?</h3> <p>If you’re a user of Netflix, Amazon, or Facebook, you know the powers and the weaknesses of an implicit feedback system for user profiling and recommendations. Compared with explicit, implicit has the large advantage of providing the user a super-smooth user experience. No need to tell the system what you’re interested in, it’s busy figuring that out for itself. The clear problem though, the problem that I think necessitates IFs, is many of the things that leak through in implicit feedback we would not at all claim as preferences.</p> <p>I’ll admit, I sometimes click on dumb clickbait. Frustratingly, the machine learning system behind whatever site I’m on will not notice the <em>instant regret</em> I feel having done so, and instead register a positive signal to show more me more articles like “23 times Kloé Kardashian left the house without shoes”. I don’t care about this person, any time I happen to click on anything about them was a moment of brain failure, perhaps at 2am and in a state where I might not be tapping things quite so precisely. Too late though, down the line I’ll be updated when her boyfriend is seen suspicuously grocery shopping with another woman. A woman that’s probably just his sister.</p> <p>From what I’ve come to learn about natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and information filtering generally, it <em>should</em> be more-or-less possible for me to just type in:</p> <blockquote> <p>Do not show me celebrity gossip. I do not care about the Bachelorettes, the Kardashians, or anyone Instagram famous.</p> </blockquote> <p>It <em>should</em> be possible for me to type in:</p> <blockquote> <p>I like sport, particularly Tennis, Soccer, and AFL, but do not show me anything about Cricket</p> </blockquote> <p>Currently Facebook and Google News <em>do</em> have systems that partially have this functionality, though crucially you have to <em>wait</em> for it to show up before you can click a drop down and select “don’t show me stories about X”. I think this is an anti-pattern. The filtering configuration is hidden from me, so I can only fix it through a couple of knobs that only appear once the system has made a mistake. I would <em>really</em> like these filtering configurations to be shareable. If someone discovers/designs a really good way to filter out stuff about horoscopes, they should be able to share it and I should be able to install it into my system. We could even build customisable user profiles to solve the cold-start problem. I’d really like <a href="http://www.tristanharris.com/">Tristan Harris’s</a> filtering configuration, or Noam Chomsky’s.</p> <h3 id="good-recommendation-systems-are-apparently-an-ai-complete-challenge">Good recommendation systems are apparently an AI-complete challenge</h3> <p>Beyond the struggles with the implicit vs. explicit self, for some reason recommender engines struggle immensely with <a href="https://twitter.com/kibblesmith/status/724817086309142529?lang=en">fairly straightforward things</a>. In an age where we’re getting constantly bombarded with useless, irrelevant crap, even if they wanted to our recommender systems couldn’t save us.</p> <p>I get much better recommendations from informed friends and colleagues than I do from any multi-billion dollar recommendation engine. The familiar human beings don’t need to rely on proxy signals for quality like ‘this is getting clicked a lot’, or ‘this contains a lot of words usually found in articles you’ve saved’. They have their own personal human General Intelligence, a wealth of relevant experience in specific areas, and deep understanding of my own experiences and needs. To the extent that recommendation engines succeed right now, I think most of it is driven by a well-curated group of ‘followees’. This is at least the experience I’ve had with Twitter, where much of the content delivered is relevant because I follow almost exclusively AI researchers and prominent software engineers. Francois Chollét still dumps loads of shit into my feed though, and Twitter hasn’t fixed that.</p> <p>So newsfeeds may really need a really solid group of humans to deliver relevant content and filter out rubbish, but looking beyond the current paradigm of recommender systems which optimise for the likelihood of a user clicking on the things it recommends, we can see that good recommendations are an incredibly complex problem. <a href="http://maroo.cs.umass.edu/getpdf.php?id=131">Information Filtering can be reframed as a twist on Information Retrieval (IR)</a>, and under this reframing we can think about a filtering system that blocked content under the kinds of highly complicated criteria embedded in highly complicated search queries.</p> <p>If I ask of an Information Retrieval system (ie. a search engine), “Which distributed graph database best optimises for HTTP request trace storage?”, anything not featured on the first page is essentially <em>filtered</em>. For an example of the IF &lt;-&gt; IR relationship that is more applicable to newsfeeds and online media space, think of the question “How can I engage and act politically in order to safeguard the economic futures of local miners in my community?”. The IF mirror of that is “I don’t want information that hinders my goal of safeguarding the economic futures of local miners in my community”. We recently had a period where people <em>really</em> needed answers to these kinds of questions, and unfortunately their newsfeed technologies failed them.</p> <h3 id="what-have-we-got-to-work-with">What have we got to work with</h3> <p>Wanting to whack together an information filterer myself, I went after existing implementations and research. Information Filtering was a bit of a thing 30 years ago, before even Google, and well before Facebook. Systems like <a href="http://delivery.acm.org.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/10.1145/30000/22340/p1-malone.pdf?ip=131.170.21.110&amp;id=22340&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=65D80644F295BC0D%2E124032AC6F25F239%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=826579750&amp;CFTOKEN=62469482&amp;__acm__=1510028698_c214de9c28b7c096c548454bc93d06a2">“The Information Lens”</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ552498">INFOS</a>, <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/73/1/1994-7.pdf">SIFT</a>, and NewsClip. Most were concerned with managing and improving the user experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">UseNet</a>. God knows how they’d deal with today’s content networks, but at least they were trying and at least they seemed to be <em>for the user</em>.</p> <p>As an interesting analogue to problems with today’s platforms that ‘push’ content to the user, similar push-based system existed for research and business use-cases in the 90’s. Even with the use of information-filtering tooling, such systems were found to be <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=g00Gz5nR4s0C&amp;pg=PT329&amp;lpg=PT329&amp;dq=%22BackWeb%22+information+filtering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VHxxIRnI5z&amp;sig=_DrzywjFBuUyevvMdbpqnbKB0xM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2OHIzqvXAhXCJJQKHb2ADWYQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BackWeb%22%20information%20filtering&amp;f=false"><em>distracting and time-consuming for users</em></a>. The lesson here in that linked passage is so clear it’s like it leaps out of 2003 and smacks you in the face. In professional environment, <em>people recognise the value of employee time</em>, and wasted time is an expense. For social networks, user time is an <em>asset</em>, and wasted time barely makes any sense to them.</p> <p>If I had to speculate, the user experience on internet back in the late 90’s and early 2000’s was such that information filtering tools weren’t required, and now fast-forwarding to 2017 we have a paucity of good software tooling in the problem space. UseNet was created back then, and heaps of tooling around the RSS format, because they addressed the peculiar needs of the time. Then everyone and their nana joined the internet, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a> took hold, and now the internet is a place dominated by great aggregators and ad-revenue incentives.</p> <h3 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h3> <p>For now I think the highest priority in the IF space is fostering an open-source, public community led effort to make user content preferences explicitly defined, compose-able, and shareable.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Explicitly defined:</strong> not ‘I didn’t click on this show don’t show me it’, but ‘filter out anything involving X’.</li> <li><strong>Compose-able:</strong> the characterisation of everything I <em>don’t</em> want show to me is a a complicated thing. The content-based equivalent of a hostfile blacklist won’t cut it.</li> <li><strong>Shareable:</strong> I should be able to share my IF configuration both with other people and with new content providers I want to engage with. Don’t make me select topics I’m interested in or not interested in over and over again.</li> </ul> <p>Those three above would let users take back control of their content feeds from companies whose predominant goal is to cultivate large groups of eyeballs for advertisers.</p> <hr> <p>Thank you for reading.

    <p>If you followed the recent Apple events, you probably saw a picture of the A14 and M1 dies… that got me thinking about what you would see if you could pass iOS under X-Rays…</p>
<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a>, I analyzed iOS based on the number of binaries and their programming languages. As I pointed out in this past post, the size of the binaries were not taken in account. In this new article, I look at iPhone OS 1.0 and iOS 14 from a size perspective using tree maps.</p>

<p>To produce the images in this article, I extracted the root filesystem (including the dyld shared cache) of each major iOS release:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>
<th>Device</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;14.0 (18A373)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;13.1 (17A844)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>

<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;12.0 (16A366)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>

<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;11.1 (15B93)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;10.1 (14B72)</td>
<td>iPhone 5s</td>

<tr>

<p>I then created a tree map. You might be familiar with tree maps as they are often used to visualize a file hierarchy to give you a graphical overview of the structure. One key characteristic is that each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. The tree maps displayed in this article have been created using the awesome <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> and annotated with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at what you would see if you could scan iPhone OS 1.0 using X-Rays:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can already notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure is quite simple and has similarities to macOS</li>
<li>Frameworks are taking more than a third of the size</li>
<li>Fonts are taking more than 25% of the whole operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>We can go one level deeper and identify all the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the list of components, we can clearly determine all the main features of iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari + Web</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Wallpaper</li>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>Office support</li>
<li>Audio player</li>
<li>Video player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of components worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UIKit framework is taking more than 13 % of the total size</li>
<li>The wallpapers and ringtones count for 6 %</li>
<li>ICU (International Components for Unicode) takes more than 5 %</li>
<li>SpringBoard is roughly 2 %</li>
</ul>

<p>On popular demand, I added this section to provide more info about the fonts.
The huge <code>Fonts</code> block is composed of 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fonts representing 2/3 of the size</li>
<li>some caches (visible at the top of the area and representing a third of the size)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the font lovers, here is the complete list of fonts in iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<pre><code>AmericanTypewriter.ttf
AmericanTypewriterBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensed.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedLight.ttf
AmericanTypewriterLight.ttf
Arial.ttf
ArialBold.ttf
ArialBoldItalic.ttf
ArialItalic.ttf
ArialRoundedMTBold.ttf
arialuni.ttf
CourierBoldOblique.ttf
CourierNew.ttf

CourierNewBoldItalic.ttf
CourierNewItalic.ttf
CourierOblique.ttf
DB_LCD_Temp-Black.ttf
Georgia.ttf

GeorgiaBoldItalic.ttf
GeorgiaItalic.ttf
Helvetica.ttf
HelveticaBold.ttf

TrebuchetMSBoldItalic.ttf
TrebuchetMSItalic.ttf
Verdana.ttf
VerdanaBold.ttf
VerdanaBoldItalic.ttf
VerdanaItalic.ttf
Zapfino.ttf
</code></pre>
<p>The cache contains info for all these fonts and includes the 2 extra files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HelveLTMM.ps</li>
<li>TimesLTMM.ps</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't give details about each iOS release but you can inspect the tree maps from iPhone OS 2.0 to iOS 13.1:</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the number of building blocks increased with each new iOS release and the components are becoming smaller.</p>

<p>We are now in 2020 and iOS 14 is available. Without a surprise, iOS 14 is way more complex than iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the diagram highlighting the functional blocks in iOS 14:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can note that the main structure is still fairly similar to the original iPhone OS 1.0 version: the fonts, frameworks, applications, library, /usr, … are still there.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 contains a lot of <code>Preinstalled Assets</code> and <code>Linguistic Data</code>. As far as I can tell, these components are used for on-device machine learning: language detector, voices, tokenizers, vocalizers, …</li>
<li>The dyld shared cache, a caching mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1, causes the Frameworks and Private Frameworks to be split in several areas. The dyld shared cache has been marked with the red box in the diagram.</li>
<li>Health is clearly an important feature of iOS 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many components in iOS 14 that it is way more complex to identify all of them. I gave it a try nonetheless:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it is now difficult to list all the features, there are some clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is packed with on-device machine learning technologies: Face Detection, Deep Convolutional Networks, Vision frameworks, Text Recognition, Neural Network, …</li>
<li>A lot of components are related to the camera and photos: Effects, Memories, video processing, photo library, …</li>
<li>Siri and voices are clearly visible.</li>
<li>As we already mentioned, Health is an important feature.</li>
<li>We can identify a couple of features added over the years: HomeKit, Watch, CarPlay, Spotlight, Emoji 🤟, News, iWork, Wallet, Shortcuts, ARKit, …</li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are now counting for less than 6 % of the size</li>
<li>Linguistic Data represent almost 8 % of the size</li>
<li>Although the ICU size was multiplied by more than 3 since iPhone OS 1.0, it now represents approximatively 0.5% of the total</li>
</ul>

<p>For readability the previous tree maps in this article were all displayed using the same size. If we present iPhone OS 1.0 next to iOS 14 with a proportional area, you would see that the whole iPhone OS 1.0 is basically taking the size of the iOS 14 wallpapers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/Compare-iOS1-iOS14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When iPhone OS 1.0 was released in 2007, it redefined the smartphone with a limited set of core features. Nowadays iOS 14 contains an incredible amount of components. By looking at them based on their size, we can determine the most important features. We thus distinctly see Apple's AI push into on-device machine learning with technologies like object detection in images and video, language analysis, sound classification and text recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Update 24.11.2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added fonts in the iPhone OS 1.0 tree map</li>
<li>Added fonts in the iOS 14 tree map</li>
<li>Add section with fonts info for iPhone OS 1.0</li>
</ul>

To beat the crisis, the world can't simply rely on renewable energy, governments will need to include carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) into the mix if they want to <span>hit their climate targets.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4uch7"><span>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCUS could <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/transforming-industry-through-ccus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>reduce carbon emissions by almost a fifth</u></a>, but can this technology deliver on its promises or is it too good to be true?</span></p><h3 id="viewer-5vpth"><span>What is <!-- -->Carbon capture, usage and storage?</span></h3><p id="viewer-pi2c"><span>Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) refers to <!-- -->a chain of different technologies aimed at capturing waste <!-- -->carbon dioxide<!-- --> (<!-- -->CO2<!-- -->), usually from large <!-- -->point sources of pollution like power plants, <!-- -->transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere. Some could be used to help grow greenhouse plants, make plastics, or even carbonate fizzy drinks. The first step is to fit factory chimneys with solvent filters, which trap carbon emissions before they escape, then the gas can be piped to locations to be used or stored. For the moment, t<span>here are about 30 CCUS projects operating around the world, which is nowhere near enough to clean up all of our emissions. </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-fds85"><span><span>Why is CCUS needed?</span></span></h3><p id="viewer-7vj3h"><span><span>Nowadays, </span>Industrial production <span>accounts for one-quarter of CO</span>2﻿<span> emissions from energy and industrial processes. With the demand for cement, steel and chemicals remaining strong to support a growing and increasingly urbanised global population, the future production of these materials will have to be more efficient and emit much less CO</span>2<span> if governments want to meet their climate goals.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8ofv8"><span><span>In the </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/material-efficiency-in-clean-energy-transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>IEA's "Clean Technology Scenario"</u></a>, <span>more than 28 GtCO</span>2<span>﻿ could be captured from industrial facilities between now and 2060.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-5eiqn"><span><span>Carbon capture, usage and storage also offers several other potential benefits:</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-63jb1"><p><span>The ability to generate additional power thanks to </span><span>geologically stored CO</span>2 which<span> could be used to extract geothermal heat from the same locations in which it’s injected, producing renewable geothermal energy.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-bcq59"><p><span>CO2 can technically be turned into fuel, although it is rather difficult to achieve.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-dru7v"><p><span>Captured CO</span>2<span> could also be used to strengthen concrete, leading to increased infrastructure durability.</span></p></li></ul><div id="viewer-den6h"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-the-solution-to-the-climate-crisis" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_220f0481ef95495b80fcd23b618197f0~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_853%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_220f0481ef95495b80fcd23b618197f0~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><h3 id="viewer-e8ds9"><span><span><strong>Suggested Articles:</strong></span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apsbb"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-8crgb"><p><strong>⌚️ </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Fitness Trackers: Helping us Get Fit or Just Another Gadget?</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-4jk2p"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️ </strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="viewer-9j318"><span>What's the catch?</span></h3><p id="viewer-89c60"><span>CCUS has always been controversial, m<!-- -->ost people are either heavily in favour of CCUS technology or heavily against.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>After many hours of work, it was finally time to give people access to my new project, a SaaS boilerplate. In the first 5 days of early access, I almost made $2k in sales ($1,901.40 to be exact).</p><p>I have made and sold a React boilerplate before, <a href="https://www.reactmilkshake.com/">React Milkshake</a>. In the week after launching React Milkshake I made just 29 dollars. I, later on, created upgraded versions of the boilerplate. Every new version sold a bit better than the previous one, but with my completely new project <a href="https://serverless.page/">Serverless SaaS</a> I have made more in one week than with all the previous projects combined in a year.</p><p>This didn’t just happen because I just got luckier this time. Here is what I did differently.</p><h3>Landing page before product building</h3><p>The first mistake I made in the previous projects was working by myself until it was time to launch. This meant I didn’t have an audience.</p><p>Inspired by the #BuildInPublic movement, I decided for my new project to first build <a href="https://serverless.page/">the landing page</a> and open up a mailing list so people could subscribe and follow the progress of me building the product. Every now and then I shared some updates and slowly grew the mailing list to over 100 people that were sincerely interested in what I was making.</p><h3>Blogging</h3><p>In the past, I had written some articles on Medium before, but I decided to at least write one or two new blog posts every month. In total, I have at least 10 new blog posts that are related to some of the technologies that are being used in <a href="https://serverless.page/">Serverless SaaS</a>. Most of them are tutorials like <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-set-up-next-js-with-tailwind-css-b93ccd2d4164">How to setup Next.js with Tailwind</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-implement-netlify-cms-with-next-js-4b8721bdec45">How to implement Netlify CMS with Next.js</a>, but also a series called <em>stack choices</em> in which I compare different frameworks or technologies with each other as <a href="https://codeburst.io/stack-choices-react-vs-vue-vs-angular-vs-svelte-49aa0170c634">Angular vs React vs Vue vs Svelte</a>.</p><p>Writing these blog posts had multiple purposes and ended up with benefits:</p><ul><li>Learned a lot about these subjects</li><li>Provided value for other people learning about these subject</li><li>Earned some money with the <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Getting-started-with-the-Medium-Partner-Program#h_01EECWD3WWHZTJMF5PTK7AAM2C">Medium Partner Program</a></li><li>Gave me the ability to drop a link to my new project</li><li>Gave me the ability to drop a link to my personal site and Twitter</li><li>Increased my followings on Medium</li></ul><p>The people who read my blog posts could also be future customers because the starter-kit is mainly for developers (or people who work with developers).</p><h3>Mailing list</h3><p>This time I had built up a mailing list with around 100 subscribers, all with people who were interested in the boilerplate. Around 50% opened the emails I had to send and around 30% clicked the links to the site. This list is still growing because I still allow people to sign up to get regular updates.</p><p>Besides that, I already had a personal mailing list of people who had signed up for previous products I have to build like <a href="https://codestash.co/">codestash</a>, <a href="https://www.makermove.com/">makermove</a>, and <a href="https://www.raterfox.com/">raterfox</a>.</p><p>Because I started blogging more I updated <a href="https://jakeprins.com/">my personal site</a> and also added a signup field for this personal mailing list to stay informed about blog posts or product updates. In total, I had around 1000 people on this list to send out an announcement, but just 20% of that list opened the email and only 2.5% clicked the link. Those numbers are not great, but most of these subscribers come from <a href="http://raterfox.com/">raterfox.com</a>, a social platform for entertainment, which is clearly not my target audience.</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Twitter is a great platform for talking in public about the process and updates on your products. I wasn’t very active on Twitter and mainly used it to stay informed about tech-related stuff. I decided to be more active and did manage to gain some more Twitter followers. I think the slow growth is caused mostly by being more active on not just Twitter, but also on Indie Hackers and mentioning <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeprins_nl">my handle</a> in blog posts.</p><p>With the current 581 followers, I do not believe this had a very big impact on my launch. Twitter seems great for people with a couple of thousands of followers, but with &lt; 1k followers it sometimes feels like you are talking to a black hole of nothing.</p><p>I still think it’s a great way to share your work and be reachable by others. Some people started to DM me with questions about the boilerplate. This was already a good sign. Also, people told me they were excited about the upcoming launch, even better! Besides that, someone reached out to say my guides online were really helpful, which is always great to hear.</p><h3>Building a better product</h3><p>The first boilerplate I had build, <a href="https://www.reactmilkshake.com/">React Milkshake</a>, was a bit of an experiment. I was using it myself and wasn’t sure if other people were going to pay for it. It was very basic and doesn’t have a lot of features when it launched, but the fact that people started to buy it was super exciting for me. It proved that people are willing to pay money for a starter-kit that helped them save time.</p><p>For my next project, <a href="https://serverless.page/">Serverless SaaS</a>, I decided to spend more time on it and take it to the next level. I had some proof of the market, but the product needed to provide more value.</p><p>Most Indiehackers and developers I met online were building SaaS apps. I also had some ideas for building a SaaS, so a boilerplate that could help me build new SaaS apps faster was very helpful. If the boilerplate wouldn’t sell, I could still use it myself. So I decided to implement multiple SaaS features, like a billing integration with Stripe, and market the product as a way to build SaaS apps faster.</p><p>This would be more aligned with the need for most of my target audience and also allows me to ask for a higher price. It provides much more value than my other boilerplates and people are also more willing to pay for products that help them save time or make money. This project could potentially do both.</p><p>Instead of rushing to market and going with a full-on MVP approach, I figured I should take my time and craft a product to be proud of. After that, I could soft launch it as “Early Access”, so I could ask my first customers for feedback and improve the product while it’s being used by actual paying customers. In this soft launch period, I made more money than I did in the last year of my old project, so I guess I’m doing something right.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>After years of indie hacking, I have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Looking back at the months leading to the “soft” launch of my new product, I can tell that certain activities will highly increase your chances of a successful launch.</p><p>Building in public, by sharing your progress and thoughts on social platforms, could definitely help a lot.</p><p>Taking time to write articles and provide value to others helps you in building an audience and to connect with people that might end up being a customer.</p><p>Also, don’t rush the process of building a product. It can be helpful to launch fast and validate your idea as quickly as possible, but if you want to provide real value that could mean you need to put in some extra time. Once you have seen some proof of evidence that people are willing to pay for your product I think it’s good to not rush your project. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. But, when you think that MVP is ready, just ship it.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry-content" itemprop="text">
			    <p><span>Brussels, 11/11/2020 –&nbsp;On Monday</span><b> </b><span>the Austrian National Service Broadcaster (ORF) published a secret draft of a planned Council resolution seeking to undermine encryption. According to the resolution, messaging services such as Whatsapp are to allow governments to decrypt and intercept secure online communications. </span><span><b><strong>Pirates call on responsibility of representatives of the public services to uphold and protect the fundamental right to privacy as well as the security of our digital communications infrastructure. </strong></b></span></p>
<p><span><b><strong>We also call on YOU, Internet users, to contact their governments in advance of tomorrow’s deadline (12:00) for input.</strong></b></span></p>
<p><span>The proposal stands in line with regular attacks by governments on the secure encryption of content, made under the guise of the fight against organized crime and terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span>“There is no such thing as a ‘partial backdoor’ to online communications. The security of all our communications must be given priority. This has been the clear position of the European Parliament since 2017, and it is also the biggest priority of the Pirates,” says Marcel Kolaja, Pirate Vice-President of the European Parliament.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Contrary to what governments would have us believe, we have to choose between interception and security. Those who want to sacrifice secure encryption in order to enable eavesdropping will destroy the protection of private secrets, business secrets and state secrets, and open the door to mass-spying by foreign intelligence services as well as hacker attacks,” explains Pirate Patrick Breyer, German MEP.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“It is technically impossible to grant access to securely encrypted communications solely for ‘lawful’ purposes. As soon as messaging services allow for the decryption of private communications, for instance by implementing backdoors or providing master keys, the security of communications is broken once and for all – not only for the ‘legitimate’ purposes envisioned by the national governments,” adds Mikuláš Peksa, MEP and chairperson of European Pirate Party.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>“Contrary to what is argued by the Presidency, there is no middle-way between upholding the ‘fundamental rights and the digital security of governments, industry and society’ and the breaking of secure end-to-end encryption. Therefore, we demand strict rejection of the proposal by the national government’s representatives. We ask European citizens to help us now and contact their governments immediately,” stresses Markéta Gregorová, Czech Pirate MEP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>That is why</span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><b><strong><span>we prepared the letters which can help you with contacting your Permanent&nbsp;<span>representations</span>&nbsp;of the EU</span></strong></b><span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span><b><strong><span>in each country. Moreover, we translated the text into a few European languages. </span></strong></b></h2>
<h2><span>For every translation, we added the e-mail&nbsp;<span>address</span>&nbsp;of your specific Permanent representations of the EU. Feel free to use it and ask for redirecting the letter to the specific governments!</span></h2>
<p><strong>PS: DO NOT FORGET TO ADD YOUR SIGNATURE IN THE END OF THE LETTER.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Content warning</strong>: Description of a death, and photos of the cleaned site of death.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/23/death-of-sydney-uber-eats-rider-the-fourth-food-delivery-fatality-in-two-months">four cyclists were killed by car drivers in Sydney in the last 2 months</a>, a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-24/uber-eats-vows-to-improve-safety-cyclist-killed-in-inner-sydney/12913840">37-year-old man from Malaysia</a> was killed at ~6:40pm last night - on my street, 200 metres from my front door, at an intersection I cycle through 2-4 times a day. I would have gone through that intersection within 15 minutes of that time if I didn’t skip a class. If you know me, I’m usually quite outspoken about the dangers cyclists face, but this was absolutely brutal to hear.</p>
<p>They cleaned up the body, but didn’t completely clean up the UberEats meal the man was delivering. The man likely died while earning less than minimum wage - A survey conducted by the Transport Workers’ Union in September <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/23/death-of-sydney-uber-eats-rider-the-fourth-food-delivery-fatality-in-two-months">found</a> that food deliverers earned an average of just $10.42 an hour after costs. 73% said they were worried about being “seriously hurt or killed” at work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…I was driving along Cleveland st, and only had a glimpse of what happened: for those of you arguing about PPE - I think there was a helmet - and a crushed head and body, and a twisted bicycle, and, yes, one of those grey food delivery bags all in the middle of Chalmers st. I am crying tonight, because that was someone’s child, friend … a person - who is no more… .</p>

<h2 id="contributing-causes">Contributing causes</h2>
<p>This is a tragedy in itself, but there are also a number of contributing causes at play here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In NSW, cycling on a footpath <a href="https://bicyclensw.org.au/who-can-ride-on-a-footpath-in-nsw/">is illegal and carries a fine of $114</a> for those above 15 years of age. Footpath cycling is <a href="https://www.bykbikes.com.au/blogs/bike-riding-tips/riding-bikes-on-the-footpath-the-laws-for-kids-and-adults-in-australia">legal in</a> Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT, the Northern Territory and South Australia.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the UK in 2017, there is a cyclist/pedestrian collision every <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/rise-pedestrians-hit-cyclists-not-cause-leap-conclusions-396047">~9.9 million kilometres walked by a pedestrian</a>, or 531 in total. Of these 531 collisions 3 people were killed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gig economy workers have little training and often no insurance. California recently proposed a law to force Uber and other platforms to treat their workers like employees. It narrowly failed to pass after <a href="https://jakecoppinger.blog/articles/the-last-delivery-of-an-ubereats-cyclist-2020/Uber,%20Lyft,%20and%20DoorDash%20poured%20over%20$200%20million%20into">Uber, Lyft and Doordash spent &gt; US$200m</a> campaigning against the law.</p></li>
<li><p>Dedicated infrastructure for cyclists is rare in Sydney. Not only are separated bicycle lanes hard to come by, a state government <a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/design-style/sustainability/state-goverment-moves-to-rip-up-college-street-cycleway">actively removed</a> a cycleway in 2015 (which <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/central-sydney/college-st-syclists-four-times-as-likely-to-be-involved-in-a-crash-since-cycleway-removed/news-story/98ebe30e5c649407e45fd1aa7f023049">increased accidents by 400%</a>) <a href="https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2019/03/12/planned-removal-of-alexandra-canal-cycleway/">and in 2019</a>. Walking and cycling infrastructure typically receives <a href="https://theconversation.com/cycling-and-walking-can-help-drive-australias-recovery-but-not-with-less-than-2-of-transport-budgets-142176">0.1-2% of transport budgets</a>. Clover Moore is pushing hard on adding new dedicated cycle infrastructure in the City of Sydney - <a href="https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/building-new-infrastructure/creating-pop-up-cycleways-in-sydney">Six pop-up cycleways</a> have been added, which may remain if their is popular support.</p></li>
<li><p>Australian car drivers have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/mythbusting-the-reasons-why-people-hate-cyclists/8689058">unique hatred of cyclists</a>. Cyclists <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/youre-a-cyclist-so-its-your-fault-20140205-321np.html">attract a level of vitriol</a>, if not outright malice, reserved for few subjects in the laid back Aussie’s mind. Even Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, a self described “car guy” who has a number of classic and sports cars, said <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/even-tour-de-france-winner-cadel-evans-finds-cycling-in-sydney-too-intimidating-20161118-gss316.html">he doesn’t cycle in Sydney</a> due to the culture. Cyclists want to be on the road even less than car drivers want them there, but as stated earlier it is illegal to cycle on the footpath.</p></li>

<h2 id="reasons-for-change">Reasons for change</h2>
<h3 id="public-safety">Public safety</h3>
<p>Car crashes are one of the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/the-most-dangerous-activity-driving/">leading causes of death in western countries</a>, and air pollution due to cars killed <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/road-death-toll-should-include-victims-of-vehicle-emissions-report-20190628-p522a8.html">two times</a> as many people as <a href="https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/statistics/index.html">crashes do</a> in NSW each year - and they didn’t even have a choice. <a href="http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC89231/jrc89231-online%20final%20version%202.pdf">Half of PM10 particle emissions come from tire wear, suspended road dust and brake wear</a>- electric cars (even with regen braking) won’t fix this. In the US, drivers of cars <a href="http://vpc.org/regulating-the-gun-industry/gun-deaths-compared-to-motor-vehicle-deaths/">kill more people</a> than guns each year.</p>
<p>NSW has a program called <a href="https://towardszero.nsw.gov.au/">Towards Zero</a>, with the aim of reducing road fatalities to zero. One of the few cities to achieve this goal is Oslo, which <a href="https://twitter.com/andershartmann/status/1212465415743512576">reduced pedestrian and cyclist deaths in 2019 to 0</a> by making the <em>city centre</em> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90294948/what-happened-when-oslo-decided-to-make-its-downtown-basically-car-free">effectively car free</a>, replacing more than 700 parking spots with bike lanes, plants, parks and benches, increasing business.</p>

</div><div>
<h3 id="cars-are-heavily-subsidised-in-australia">Cars are heavily subsidised in Australia</h3>
<p>By the most generous measure, drivers only contribute <a href="https://www.ptua.org.au/myths/petroltax/">two-thirds of the cost of the road system</a> through rego and petrol taxes. The damage to a road is proportional to the <em>fourth power</em> of axle weight. Many cyclists also own a car and already pay rego. Contrary to popular belief, cyclists are likely subsidising car users.</p>
<h3 id="investing-in-cycle-infrastructurereducing-car-usage-makes-economic-sense">Investing in cycle infrastructure/reducing car usage makes economic sense</h3>
<p>In one study, for each dollar of investment in cycle focused infrastructure, the best practice policy returns 24 dollars in health, congestion, and air and noise pollution related benefits (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/378na1_en.pdf">Macmillan, A., Connor, J., Witten, K., et al.&nbsp;(2014). The Societal Costs and Benefits of Commuter Bicycling: Simulating the Effects of Specific Policies Using System Dynamics Modeling</a>)</p>
<p>A paper submitted to Infrastructure Australia estimated the value of commuter cycling in Australian capital cities as worth approximately <a href="https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-06/Cycling_Infrastructure_Background_Paper_16Mar09_WEB.pdf">$0.76 per kilometre travelled</a>, equating to $2,667 for each regular commuter. Another paper <a href="https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-06/Cycling_Infrastructure_Background_Paper_16Mar09_WEB.pdf">estimated</a> that converting drivers to cycling in Sydney &amp; Brisbane is worth $0.74 per kilometre, $1,920 per person annually in inner Sydney.</p>
<p>Banning cars on a street in Rome led to <a href="https://jakecoppinger.blog/articles/the-last-delivery-of-an-ubereats-cyclist-2020/www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/13/pedestrianisation-rome-italy-car-parking-ban">30% increase</a> in retail spending in that street.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://cityobservatory.org/ten-things-more-inequitable-that-road-pricing/">a lot of things</a> in our current system more inequitable than road pricing in urban areas.</p>
<h3 id="a-lot-of-other-cities-are-reducing-car-usage">A lot of other cities are reducing car usage</h3>
<p>I know this argumentum ad populum, but hey.</p>
<p>The following cities have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing">congestion tax</a> in their urban core:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theconversation.com/london-congestion-charge-what-worked-what-didnt-what-next-92478">London</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing_in_New_York_City">New York</a> (soon)</li>
<li>Stockholm</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Milan</li>
<li>Gothenburg</li>
</ul>
<p>Other efforts to reduce car usage:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Oslo (population 673k) <a href="https://twitter.com/andershartmann/status/1212465415743512576">reduced pedestrian and cyclist deaths in 2019 to 0</a> by making the city centre <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90294948/what-happened-when-oslo-decided-to-make-its-downtown-basically-car-free">effectively car free</a>, replacing more than 700 parking spots with bike lanes, plants, parks and benches. Amsterdam, New York, and San Francisco are <a href="https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/12/car-free-streets-plans-sf-market-street-new-york-europe-us/603391/">banning cars from their major streets</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Madrid banned cars from its city centre during the 2018 Christmas period, <a href="https://copenhagenize.eu/news-archive/2019/3/14/the-benefits-of-car-free-streets">increasing retail profit by 9.5%</a>, and they are planning to ban cars from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cities-going-car-free-ban-2018-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">500 acres of the city centre this year</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cities-going-car-free-ban-2018-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">Paris</a>, the first Sunday of every month is free of cars.</p></li>

<p>My son Atlas is just over nine months old. He’s just started crawling, eating solids, and getting close to saying words.</p>
<p>One thing that’s been troubling me, is that he probably won’t have liberty (freedom) in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Liberty requires a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Freedom of Self-Determination</li>
<li>Freedom to Defend Self-Determination</li>
<li>Freedom of Speech</li>
<li>Freedom of Information</li>
<li>Freedom to Privacy</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above is more-or-less enumerated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Bill of Rights</a>. The premise of liberty is simple: you have the right to do anything you desire that doesn’t impede others strive for self-determination. Although easily defined, the term “impede” is where the trouble is.</p>
<h2><del>Freedom to</del> Privacy</h2>
<p>Atlas (my son) was born in a world where <em>every single person</em> is tracked to within one meter of where they are at all times (if they have a cell phone). Everyone’s personality is classified, mood tracked, and manipulated at a grand scale.</p>
<p>Hell, as a <a href="https://insideropinion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one man startup</a>, I write systems that predict the moods in real-time of nearly a million people who are communicating on the internet (<a href="https://hnprofile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HNProfile.com</a> &amp; <a href="https://redditprofile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedditProfile.com</a>). More than that, it can predict moods, identify where they likely live, family, and even <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17940172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-anonymize them</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o.jpg" alt="" width="1234" height="321" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o.jpg 1234w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o-300x78.jpg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o-768x200.jpg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o-1024x266.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1234px) 100vw, 1234px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o.jpg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o.jpg 1234w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o-300x78.jpg 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o-768x200.jpg 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/41384957_10217638849388956_4305601918492737536_o-1024x266.jpg 1024w"></a></p>
<p>What does this mean? When everyone’s thoughts, actions, and moods can be predicted, we can be manipulated. Our government can identify “trouble” makers, the definition of which may change with the political season. Without the freedom to privacy, you don’t have freedom. I don’t see how my son can get that back. Thus, I try to keep as much out of the internet as possible.</p>
<h2><del>Freedom of</del> Information</h2>
<p>Facts… the news claims to report them, we are shown videos, hear audio clips, read documents. Occasionally, we’ve seen “fake” news and information in the past, however there’s something coming that’ll change everything.</p>
<p>Synthetic data (<a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/why-you-dont-necessarily-need-data-for-data-science-48d7bf503074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which I also work on</a>) is also becoming increasingly realistic. Meaning, the term “real news” will take on a whole new meaning. For instance, we can overlay Nicholas Cage on anyones face:</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BU9YAHigNx8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>In addition, we can do this with audio,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/why-you-dont-necessarily-need-data-for-data-science-48d7bf503074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">text from my work</a>, and I’m working on improved video too…</p>
<p>For this reason, I avoid discussing or posting images of my son on the internet. With a handful of images and a 30 second sound clip, we can start generating synthetic videos and as it relates to privacy, we can construct real-looking scenarios.</p>
<p>What does this mean? When we don’t know what’s real — <em>everything loses meaning</em>. This is the death of freedom of information; poisoning the well so-to-speak. Worse than propaganda, because we can no longer distinguish what is real. Eventually, we will all lose faith in “facts”.</p>
<h2><del>Freedom of</del> Speech</h2>
<p>Increasingly, communication occurs in a few centralized locations: Facebook (Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram), Twitter, Google Messages, Apple iMessage, Reddit, etc.; accessed via a few devices: Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android; via several service providers: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, T-Mobile.</p>
<p>Notice, each one of those systems are gatekeepers to communication with the wider world. If they ban you, you’re locked out of your community. Discussions are not “free” on any social network, which arguably is where most of the discussions happening for younger generations. This will likely increasingly be true for people from my sons generation. These are echo chambers, further manipulating free speech. Communities are segregated and if you say something people don’t like…</p>

<p>Banning people today may seem minor and deserved, however the implications are massive. Imagine if Twitter and Facebook decided to ban liberals… It would be like silencing half the United States. Although that’s only occurring in rare cases today, it appears to be occurring at an increasing rate lately[<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/twitter-asks-users-if-it-should-ban-dehumanising-speech-11509062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>What does this mean? If only three companies control 90% or more of discourse on the internet and those three companies start censoring their user bases, we no longer have free speech within our communities.</p>
<p>Final note on this, when the government [attempts to] prosecute(s) individuals who are whistle blowers (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Snowden</a>) or journalists <em>who aren’t United States citizens</em> (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julian Assange</a>), our ability to practice “freedom of speech” is all but a farce.</p>
<h2><del>Freedom to</del> Defend Self-Determination</h2>
<p>This is a touchy subject for some. The idea is that without the ability to defend your liberties at some point, they’re bound to be taken away. That doesn’t necessarily mean arms (weapons, guns); this includes legal proceedings to defend your rights. Unfortunately, with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/what-you-need-know-about-fisa-court-and-how-it-needs-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FISA court</a>, they can both issue warrants and gag orders, with the court not really answering to anyone. Meaning, there is no way to defend yourself legally.</p>
<p>Historically, this is where arms (weapons, guns) come in. It’s the final, ultimate check to a government. Are we there yet? Not quite, but say the government decided to ban abortion and make it illegal to be LGTB (after so many people have come out)? The only defense those people have will be defending themselves “illegally” with weapons. That’s, in part, why we have that embedded in the constitution of the United States.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufTEtGQZZ9g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>What does this mean? To have self-determination, you need to have the means to defend it. Otherwise, you wont have it any more, typically when a tyrannical government comes to power. In the documentary above, a sitting representative, supposedly with the authority to review the NSA has their house broken into… by the very organization(s) it’s supposed to oversee.</p>
<h2><del>Freedom of</del> self-determination</h2>
<p>With the above eroded away, with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mood manipulation</a> prevalent, 24/7 real-time surveillance, from devices we even install ourselves…</p>

Self-determination requires we have access to information, the ability to choose the way we live (including privately), the ability we can decide who, what, where, when why we do what we do.</p>
<p>I was born free. My father was born free. My grand-father was born free.</p>
<p>We didn’t always have welfare, social security, and other forms of security. We’ve always had terrorism, and the risks of life. To a large degree, our society (and world) has tried to leave this Earth, better than we left it. Unfortunately, it appears as our society grows — it is suffocating what it strives to protect: life &amp; liberty.</p>
<p>Today, my son has no hope for liberty.</p>
<p>All I can do, is provide him the best opportunity for privacy I can. I don’t upload his photos, I’m working on these systems so I can control their development, I donate to the EFF, and I do my best to inform others. I’ll fight for change, but the first step is to inform.</p>

Even media reports about intellectual property sometimes get the terms mixed up. But, to IP practitioners, they represent very different concepts.

This can lead to some initial confusion when business owners contact an IP firm to discuss protecting their intangible assets. If you want to go in with some handle on the jargon, not to worry. Knowmad Law is here with some simple pointers.</span></p><p id="viewer-els3f"><span><strong>Patents</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fvt5e"><span>Attorneys must have a science background and pass a special bar exam to file patent applications. In many firms patent <a href="https://www.knowmad.law/glossary" target="_top" rel="noopener">prosecution</a> is an entirely separate practice group from trademark, copyright and trade secret matters (sometimes somewhat-condescendingly referred to as “soft IP”). When people talk about “patents,” they’re usually talking about utility patents, but, confusingly, U.S. law also recognizes design patents and <a href="https://www.knowmad.law/post/plantpatents" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plant patents</u></a>, which are technically subcategories of patent but may be better thought of as separate forms of IP.</span></p><p id="viewer-b40ff"><span><em><strong>What it protects: </strong></em>new and useful inventions, including machines and processes</span></p><p id="viewer-ar8ft"><span><em><strong>Why it exists: </strong></em>to incentivize innovation</span></p><p id="viewer-59bk8"><span><em><strong>How you get it: </strong></em>application to USPTO</span></p><p id="viewer-3hst6"><span><em><strong>What it gives you:</strong></em> the exclusive right to sell, make or use an invention for 20 years</span></p><p id="viewer-4h0if"><span><strong>Copyright</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7v4s4"><span>Unlike patents and trademarks, there isn’t really a discreet unit of intellectual property known as “a copyright” (though the term is often used as shorthand for “copyright registration”). Instead, we find it preferable to think of “copyright” as an uncountable noun like “knowledge” and to discuss our clients’ copyright portfolios in terms of <em>works subject to copyright</em>.</span></p><p id="viewer-6b4oo"><span><em><strong>What it protects:</strong></em> works of creative expression, including any original text, graphic, audio or video content</span></p><p id="viewer-b3v8k"><span><em><strong>Why it exists:</strong></em> to incentivize creative activity</span></p><p id="viewer-fbl0u"><span><em><strong>How you get it:</strong></em> creating something (registration with Library of Congress grants additional rights)</span></p><p id="viewer-efncf"><span><em><strong>What it gives you: </strong></em>the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute or display a work for 70 years after your death (or 95 years for institutional authors)</span></p><p id="viewer-jvde"><span><strong>Trademarks</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-8ue5u"><span>Trademark law is rooted in consumer protection and market regulation. This is an important distinction from patents and copyright, which are essentially government bounties to reward inventors and artists. Whereas the Patent Act and Copyright Act are based upon a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific provision of the U.S. Constitution </a>directed to encouraging “science and the useful arts,” Congress relied on the regular old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commerce Clause</a> to pass the Trademark Act.</span></p><p id="viewer-2jqe6"><span><em><strong>What it protects:</strong></em> indications of origin for goods and services, including words and symbols</span></p><p id="viewer-1a3h"><span><em><strong>Why it exists:</strong></em> to prevent consumer confusion and deceptive business practices</span></p><p id="viewer-e9av4"><span><em><strong>How you get it: </strong></em>using a mark to sell or market particular goods or services (registration with USPTO grants additional rights)</span></p><p id="viewer-1pl7q"><span><em><strong>What it gives you:</strong></em> the right to prevent others from using similar marks to sell or market related goods or services</span></p><p id="viewer-34nun"><span><strong>Trade Secrets</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-cquao"><span>Rounding out the “big four” of intellectual property are trade secrets. Though less often discussed than patents, trademarks and copyright, trade secrets are often the only way to protect a business’s most valuable assets.</span></p><p id="viewer-a2oov"><span><em><strong>What it protects:</strong></em> valuable and confidential information</span></p><p id="viewer-epc8h"><span><em><strong>Why it exists:</strong></em> to prevent unfair business practices</span></p><p id="viewer-64v3l"><span><em><strong>How you get it: </strong></em>keeping the information secret</span></p><p id="viewer-6m0m0"><span><em><strong>What it gives you: </strong></em>a claim against anyone who obtains or spreads the information by improper means</span></p><p id="viewer-d3rvm"><span>There’s a certain amount of overlap between these spheres of protection. For example, a company might use a trademark to market its patented technology. Or a computer process might be the subject of a patent, while the specific code used to implement the process is covered by copyright. In both cases, these tangential rights would persist after the patent expires.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

November 23, 2020 | https://austingwalters.com/crossing-the-rubicon/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://austingwalters.com/crossing-the-rubicon/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3793">

<div>
<p>The phrase: “Crossing the Rubicon” refers to when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon river with a legion on January 10, 49 BC, leading to the Roman Civil War.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the United States is at that cross roads. Make no mistake, we are witnessing a power struggle, one which could easily lead to armed conflict across the United States and perhaps the world.</p>
<p>I believe most people believe this is due to Donald Trump; perhaps. However, I contend it’s actually much deeper. Rather than Trump, I believe the corporations have crossed the Rubicon, effectively electing Joe Biden. I’m not confident it was coordinated, but it does appear there has been a concerted effort to elect Joe Biden (influencing our news). We can all see it.</p>
<p>In November 2018, I wrote “<a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last Free Generation</a>” about how this is the last generation that will have freewill. What I didn’t expect was the 2020 elections to be so obvious.</p>
<blockquote><p>For reference: I would never vote for Trump. I believe his character is too divisive and a leader who can’t unite is not a leader.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Censorship in 2020</h2>
<p>The 2020 elections are astonishing. It is the first election I’ve experienced where literally there was a media blacking out a president. Quite literally, Donald Trump was regularly taken off the air.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUVkFvcN08o" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Even my posts are regularly flagged on Hacker News (all of them were flagged at one point by the community, many decisions were reversed by the community or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=dang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dang</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53.png" alt="" width="618" height="245" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53.png 618w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53-300x119.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53.png 618w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-23-21-19-53-300x119.png 300w"></a>Dorsey even said he was censoring real stories (the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020-11-18%20HSGAC%20-%20Finance%20Joint%20Report%20Supplemental.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunter Biden Laptop)</a>:</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWayExRuaYk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>So what? Dorsey later corrected himself, Donald Trump was claiming inaccurate information.</p>
<p>The problem is it manipulated the information people viewed. It was clearly election interference, to remove unfavorable information about a given candidate. There’s similarly a pinned tweet from President Trump.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Za1BByChjN">pic.twitter.com/Za1BByChjN</a></p>
<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1331057517095489539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the video, there is a claim that Google intentionally did not provide voter notifications to conservatives, while liberals were receiving voter notifications. Search history was being adjusted, websites blocked, etc. There was a 700+ person study and there’s solid evidence.</p>
<h2>The Executive Order</h2>
<p>What I think many have missed is the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-imposing-certain-sanctions-event-foreign-interference-united-states-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Executive Order on Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election</a>. The introduction,</p>
<blockquote><p>I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections, including through the unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the outcome or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America’s free and open political system. In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference, as illustrated in the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with this threat.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a pretty good video on this, see video below:</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2MkvWh7poY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Effectively, in 45 days of the election; we’re likely to see a report on any foreign interference in the United States election.</p>
<p>For something to be considered “foreign interference” one of the following criteria must be met:</p>
<blockquote><p>(i) to have directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed, or otherwise been complicit in foreign interference in a United States election;</p>
<p>(ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any activity described in subsection (a)(i) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</p>
<p>(iii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, for tech companies &amp; media companies it’s quite possible this criteria is met (see subsection iii on “acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly”).</p>
<h2>Where is Barr?</h2>
<p>On October 20, 2020, many states and the federal government of the United States <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/20/925736276/google-abuses-its-monopoly-power-over-search-justice-department-says-in-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google</a>. At the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-11-states-accuse-google-antitrust-violations-n1244005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many including Google</a>, claimed it would not be effective; the lawyers even said they were not prepared. What if it’s about the lawsuits, but it’s also about implicating Google in manipulations of the elections. When a lawsuit of this kind is filed, discovery is allotted. Barr was animate about doing the initial lawsuit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before the election.</a></p>
<p>From the public hearings with Zuckerberg and Dorsey, they implicated their companies (and themselves) in suppressing stories (inaccurately I might add) and with the discovery allotted from the lawsuit brought by Barr, they now have the all three of them “red handed” and that executive order can be utilized to it’s full effect.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m not saying Trump will utilize this executive order. However, he has the authority to do so until December 18, 2020 (45 days after the election). I would not at all be surprised if a plan is executed to seriously cripple the media and at the same time he presents his claims of election fraud (not claiming they’re true one way or the other).</p>

			<p>It has been a very long time since I’ve dealt with a major loom screw up.&nbsp; A really long time.&nbsp; Like I don’t remember the last time?&nbsp; And it isn’t because I’m so very good at this whole weaving thing, but it sort of is.&nbsp; I’ve been weaving since the mid 70’s.&nbsp; If there is a mistake, or screw up, I can assure you I made it or did it at some point in my career.&nbsp; One of the glorious things about being a weaver is the pure tenacity that controls what we do and how we approach a situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course by now, you are all familiar with my daughter and her major accomplishments as a weaver.&nbsp; She works for me now, and is responsible for converting all of my garment patterns into <a href="https://www.weaversew.com/shop/sewing-patterns.html">digital downloads</a>.&nbsp; She is also responsible for filming, producing and editing all of my videos for my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmz2mYvnteUP11-LvK8-eNg"><em>The Weaver Sews</em></a> and writing all of the Closed Captioning.&nbsp; (Yes, I caught that there were a couple of misspellings in previous episodes…)&nbsp; I couldn’t have moved into this next portion of my professional life without her, but that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>My daughter, Brianna, yes she has a real name, not the one she uses on Facebook, was asked back last winter if she would give a lecture to her old weaving guild in MA, near where she went to school.&nbsp; The lecture, on differential sett, was scheduled for April of this year.&nbsp; And of course we all know what happened in the northeast by April.&nbsp; The world was cancelled.</p>
<p>Since my daughter is a soon to be 28 year old millennial, she does her best work under deadline pressure.&nbsp; (Truth be told, so do I…)&nbsp; The guild called her last week and asked if she would be willing to give the lecture remotely.&nbsp; Hahahahah!&nbsp; Of course she said yes, which is what I would have done at that age.&nbsp; I use to have a sign on&nbsp; my studio door that said, “Say yes, then worry…”</p>
<p>So my daughter had to build an entire lecture that only existed as an outline, and weave all the samples in less than two weeks (the lecture is next week), plus edit and create new content for me, plus work in the evenings on her schooling, (yes, she is still in school to get her vet tech license).&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it….</p>
<p>One of the samples Brianna decided to weave, was exploring what happens when you use differential sett with really slippery rayon, warp and weft, and then slippery rayon warp and a dragging kind of weft like Shetland wool.&nbsp; The sample with the slippery rayon warp, though challenging, was completely successful.&nbsp; She then wound a warp with the Shetland wool, and the idea was she would tie into the rayon warp and repeat the experiment with a rayon weft and a wool weft, producing an additional two samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point, she said to me, as I was weaving on another of the looms in the studio, “This is ridiculous, tying in a new warp, I could have started fresh, sleying and rethreading in half the time…”&nbsp; and I couldn’t disagree with her.&nbsp; I’ve never found tying in a new warp to be a time saver.</p>
<p>I went off to do something else and came back and she had only tied in about 2/3rds of the warp, and she moved onto a different loom to do other samples of different weave structures.&nbsp; She told me that she was fed up and didn’t have the time to waste tying in 600 ends on a table loom.&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>I went off to other projects of my own, like writing the script for Friday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmz2mYvnteUP11-LvK8-eNg"><em>The Weaver Sews</em></a> Youtube installment.&nbsp; I came back and decided to finish tying in the rest of the warp, which would have been 200 ends.&nbsp; It wasn’t a big deal, and I can do stuff like that in my sleep.&nbsp; I was surprised when she directed me to make a square knot, I had always tied in new warps with an overhand knot, but I learned long ago that I didn’t argue with my late husband, and I don’t argue with his daughter.&nbsp; Even though I have almost a half century of experience…</p>
<p>I finished the task and then turned the job of beaming the 1&nbsp; 1/2 yard warp of sticky Shetland wool, onto the warp beam, over to my daughter.&nbsp; I think I went off to bed…</p>
<p>I came back the next day to find the warp abandoned.&nbsp; It was a complete disaster.&nbsp; I don’t think even at my worst I’ve ever had a mess like that.&nbsp; Partly I take some responsibility because my daughter has worked along side of me since she first learned to throw a shuttle.&nbsp; She never had the opportunity to fall flat on her face, like most weavers, including me, have had to do.&nbsp; I’ve always been there to guide her, when she chooses to listen to me.&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>Largely what happened, is that when she put tensioning bars in the back of the warp, and tried to beam the new sticky Shetland warp into the old slick rayon warp, the square knots didn’t hold, they slipped right out.&nbsp; And for some reason, the Shetland wool ends, that slipped out of the knots, ended up in the front of the beater, probably about 200 of the 600 ends.&nbsp; I think this wins an award for the most messed up warp I’ve ever seen.&nbsp; That’s partly why I did it…</p>

<p>I felt really sorry for my daughter, she was trying so hard to see this lecture into fruition…&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>I felt partly responsible because I knew that when you tie in a warp, you always use overhand knots.&nbsp; There are a lot of things I know, but I don’t know why I know them.&nbsp; And because my daughter requested square knots, I obliged.&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>I laid awake all Thursday night haunted by the mess on one of the looms in the garage right underneath of me.&nbsp; I kept thinking, if that were me, I wouldn’t have gone to bed without fixing it.&nbsp; But that’s me, even though I knew I had a video to shoot in the morning. I didn’t sleep the whole night.&nbsp; My daughter just moved to a different loom, and started on a different group of samples she had been planning.</p>
<p>In fact my daughter was so upset by what happened that she couldn’t even look at the loom. She couldn’t even walk over to that area of the studio.&nbsp; &nbsp;She is not use to having major loom screw ups…&nbsp; I’ve largely protected her from that…&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>We stopped everything to shoot the new video Friday morning, and I had some computer/business stuff to attend to, but Friday afternoon, I sat at the loom and thought, it has been a very long time since I’ve bailed a loom out of a major temper tantrum, and you know what?&nbsp; I really wanted to just dive in there and fix it.&nbsp; That’s why I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I had my new to me dog chew up a skein of yarn that was being wound into pirns for the weft yarn for a project I was working on.&nbsp; I got distracted by the doorbell, and when I returned I found&nbsp; the skein stretched around my loom, and all the way down the stairs, and the skein chewed beyond help.&nbsp; I can’t believe the number of weaver’s who offered to have me send them the skein and promised to untangle every last yard.&nbsp; There is something about fixing a monumental disaster that is really appealing for a weaver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster-169x300.jpg 169w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster-84x150.jpg 84w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster.jpg 345w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px"></a></p>
<p>I sort of think that it has to do with creating calm in chaos.&nbsp; There is so little in the world that we have any control over.&nbsp; But what happens at our looms, that thing, we have control over.&nbsp; And if what happens on our looms becomes total chaos, then patience, tenacity, and time will make it work.&nbsp; That’s why I did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I started Friday afternoon, after the shoot, and I began to reassess the 600 ends and how to best resolve the mess.&nbsp; Cutting the whole thing off and starting over was an option, but it would mean wasting a perfectly good 1 1/2 yard Shetland warp, that I paid good money for…</p>
<p>I decided that the best way out, was to carefully pull the warps that ended up in front of the reed, since they were only 1 1/2 yards, and resleying them where required (because this was a differential sett warp, there were dents where there were as many as five ends) and then carefully tying them back into the slippery rayon warps that went through the heddles, one by one.&nbsp; I probably spent 10 hours.&nbsp; This was really really challenging.</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3-150x113.jpg 150w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>I did it because there is something intensely satisfying about bringing order to chaos.&nbsp; There is something intense about saving a project.&nbsp; I had my doubts that this was even weaveable, 5 ends of Shetland in a 12 dent reed on a table loom didn’t see realistic, but that wasn’t for me to judge.&nbsp; I grabbed my 5X glasses, a magnifying OTT lite, and a sley hook and started in.&nbsp; 10 hours later I was triumphant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4-150x113.jpg 150w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>As I suspected, the warp was unweaveable at that dentage, Brianna had to pull some of the densest parts of the warp, but after much bitching and kvetching, she managed to get the sample she needed, but that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5-150x113.jpg 150w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>For all of you out there who have ever had to deal with the warp from hell, remember that there is something healing in finally controlling that which would not be controlled, something triumphant about making something from total chaos.&nbsp; And that’s&nbsp; why I did it.&nbsp; It has been a long time since I’ve had to bail out a major loom screw up, and I loved every minute of it.&nbsp; It wasn’t my screw up, but I felt like a warrior on a mission and I was ultimately successful.&nbsp; Mission accomplished.&nbsp; It was sort of poignant that in the middle of the last inch and a half, that the election finals were called.&nbsp; No matter who you supported, the wait is over.&nbsp; And there is a sort of relief there, and now we as a nation can move forward to what I hope is a common goal.&nbsp; My ten hours of determination over a warp from hell was finally over.&nbsp; And I won.</p>
<p>Brianna did manage to beam and weave the new samples.&nbsp; She did as I suspected have to cull some of the warps in the densest part of the reed.&nbsp; But she learned that on her own.&nbsp; And she also learned that when tying in a new warp, you should use overhand knots.&nbsp; But kids learn by falling flat on their faces and picking themselves up and reevaluating the experience.&nbsp; I never had anyone to tell me otherwise, so I learned the hard way, by trial and error, but that weaver’s tenacity kept me moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To say that I’m so proud of the body of samples she …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Up to now, I have used vi as an example for modal text editor, mostly because
I expect most programmers have at least heard of it. However, I don’t believe
vi and clones are the best modal text editor out there.</p>
<p>I have been working, for the last 5 years, on a new modal editor called
Kakoune. It first started as a reimplementation of Vim (the most popular vi
clone) whose source code is quite dated. But, I soon realized that we could
improve a lot on vi editing model.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_improving_on_the_editing_model">Improving on the editing model</h3>
<p>vi basic grammar is <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong>; it’s nice because it matches
well with the order we use in English, "delete word". On the other hand,
it does not match well with the nature of what we express: There is only
a handful of <strong>verbs</strong> in text editing (<strong>d</strong>elete, <strong>y</strong>ank, <strong>p</strong>aste,
<strong>i</strong>nsert…​), and they don’t compose, contrarily to <strong>objects</strong> which can be
arbitrarily complex, and difficult to express. That means that errors are
not handled well. If you express your object wrongly with a delete verb,
the wrong text will get deleted, you will need to undo, and try again.</p>
<p>Kakoune’s grammar is <strong>object</strong> followed by <strong>verb</strong>, combined with instantaneous
feedback, that means you always see the current object (In Kakoune we call
that the selection) before you apply your change, which allows you to correct
errors on the go.</p>
<p>Kakoune tries hard to fix one of the big problems with the vi model: its
lack of interactivity. Because of the <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong> grammar,
vi changes are made in the dark, we don’t see their effect until the whole
editing <strong>sentence</strong> is finished. <code>5dw</code> will delete to next five words, if
you then realize that was one word too many, you need to undo, go back to
your initial position, and try again with <code>4dw</code>. In Kakoune, you would do
<code>5W</code>, see immediately that one more word than expected was selected, type
<code>BH</code> to remove that word from the selection, then <code>d</code> to delete.  At each
step you get visual feedback, and have the opportunity to correct it.</p>
<p>At the lower level, the problem is that vi treats moving around and selecting
an object as two different things. Kakoune unifies that, moving <strong>is</strong> selecting.
<code>w</code> does not just go to the next word, it selects from current position to
the next word. By convention, capital commands tend to expand the selection,
so <code>W</code> would expand the current selection to the next word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_multiple_selections">Multiple selections</h3>
<p>Another particular feature of Kakoune is its support for, and emphasis
towards the use of multiple selections. Multiple selections in Kakoune
are not just one additional feature, it is the central way of interacting
with your text. For example there is no such thing as a "global replace" in
Kakoune. What you would do is select the whole buffer with the <code>%</code> command,
then select all matches for a regex in the current selections (that is the
whole buffer here) with the <code>s</code> command, which prompts for a regex. You would
end up with one selection for each match of your regex and use the insert
mode to do your change. Globally replacing foo with bar would be done with
<code>%sfoo&lt;ret&gt;cbar&lt;esc&gt;</code> which is just the combination of basic building blocks.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple selections provides us with a very powerful to express structural
selection: we can subselect matches inside the current selections, keep
selections containing/not containing a match, split selections on a regex,
swap selections contents…​</p>
<p>For example, convert from <code>snake_case_style</code> to <code>camelCaseStyle</code> can be done
by selecting the word (with <code>w</code> for example) then subselecting underscores
in the word with <code>s_&lt;ret&gt;</code>, deleting these with <code>d</code>, then upper casing the
selected characters with <code>~</code>. The inverse operation could be done by selecting
the word, then subselecting the upper case characters with <code>s[A-Z]&lt;ret&gt;</code>
lower casing them with ` and then inserting an underscore before them with
<code>i_&lt;esc&gt;</code> This operation could be put in a macro, and would be reusable
easily to convert any identifier.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Another example would be parameter swapping, if you had <code>func(arg2, arg1);</code>
you could select the contents of the parenthesis with <code>&lt;a-i&gt;(</code>, split the
selection on comma with <code>S, &lt;ret&gt;</code>, and swap selection contents with <code>&lt;a-)&gt;</code>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is as well easy to use multiple selections for alignment, as the <code>&amp;</code>
command will align all selection cursors by inserting blanks before
selection start</p>

<p>Or to use multiple selections as a way to gather some text from different
places and regroup it in another place, thanks to a special form of pasting
<code>&lt;a-p&gt;</code> that will paste every yanked selections instead of the first one.</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_interactive_predictable_and_fast">Interactive, predictable and fast</h3>
<p>A design goal of Kakoune is to beat vim at its own game, while providing a
cleaner editing model. The combination of multiple selections and cleaned up
grammar shows that it’s possible to have text edition that is interactive,
predictable, and fast at the same time.</p>
<p>Interactivity comes from providing feedback on every command, made possible by
the inverted <strong>object</strong> then <strong>verb</strong> grammar. Every selection modification
has direct visual feedback; regex-based selections incrementally show what
will get selected, including when the regular expression is invalid; and even
yanking some text displays a message notifying how many selections were yanked.</p>
<p>Predictability comes from the simple effect of most commands. Each command is
conceptually simple, doing one single thing. <code>d</code> deletes whatever is selected,
nothing more. <code>%</code> selects the whole buffer. <code>s</code> prompts for a regex and
selects matches in the previous selection. It is the combination of these
building blocks that allows for complex, but predictable, actions on the text.</p>
<p>Being fast, as in requiring fewer keystrokes, is provided by carefully designing
the set of editing commands so that they interact well together, and by sometimes
sacrificing beauty for useability. For example, <code>&lt;a-s&gt;</code> is equivalent to
<code>S^&lt;ret&gt;</code>: they both split on new lines, but this is such a common use case that
it deserves to have its own key shortcut. As shown in <a href="http://github.com/mawww/golf">http://github.com/mawww/golf</a>,
Kakoune manages to beat Vim at the keystroke count game in most cases,
using much more idiomatic commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs tend to be at a disadvantage compared to GUI
applications because they are less discoverable; there is no menu bar on
which to click to see the available options, no tooltip appearing when you
hover above a button explaining what it does.</p>
<p>Kakoune solves this problem through the use of two mechanisms: extensive
completion support, and auto-information display.</p>
<p>When a command is written in a prompt, Kakoune will automatically open a menu
providing you with the available completions for the current parameter. It
will know if the parameter is supposed to be a word against a fixed set
of word, the name of a buffer, a filename, etc…​ Actually, as soon as <code>:</code>
is typed, entering command prompt mode, the list of existing commands will
be displayed in the completion menu.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kakoune will display an information box, describing what the
command does, what optional switches it can take, what they do…​</p>

<p>Command discoverability</p>
<p>

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>That information box gets displayed in other cases, for example if the <code>g</code>
key is hit, which then waits for another key (<code>g</code> is the <strong>goto</strong> commands
prefix), an information box will display all the recognized keys, informing
the user that Kakoune is waiting on a keystroke, and listing the available
options.</p>
<p>To go even further in discoverability, the auto information system can
be set to display an information box after each normal mode keystroke,
explaining what the key pressed just did.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_extensive_completion_support">Extensive completion support</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs are much easier to work with when they provide
extensive completion support. For a long time, completion has been prefix
based, and that has been working very well.</p>
<p>More recently, we started to see more and more programs using the so called
fuzzy completion. Fuzzy completion tends to be subsequence based, instead
of prefix based, which means the typed query needs to be a subsequence of
a candidate to be considered matching, instead of a prefix. That will generate
more candidates (all prefix matches are also subsequence matches), so it
needs a good ranking algorithm to sort the matches and put the best ones first.</p>
<p>Kakoune embraces fuzzy matching for its completion support, which kicks in both
during insert mode, and prompt mode.</p>
<div>
<p>Word completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Insert mode completion provides completion suggestions while inserting in the
buffer, it can complete words from the buffer, or from all buffers, lines,
filenames, or get completion candidates from an external source, making it
possible to implement intelligent code completion.</p>
<div>
<p>Language specific completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/cpp-completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Prompt completion is displayed whenever we enter command mode, and provides
completion candidates that are adapted to the command being entered, and to
the current argument being edited.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_a_better_unix_citizen">A better unix citizen</h3>
<p>Easily making programs cooperate with each others is one of the main strength
of the Unix environment. Kakoune is designed to integrate nicely with a POSIX
system: various text editing commands give direct access to the power of POSIX
tools, like <code>|</code>, which prompts for a shell command and pipe selections through
it, replacing their contents with the command output, or <code>$</code> that prompts for
a command, and keeps selections for which the command returned success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I love ED on CP/M.  It's often derided but I think it's just misunderstood and with a little practise its true value can shine through.  It's elegant, easy to learn and only has about 25 commands but these can be combined.  Once you get used to it most editing tasks are pretty quick.  If I'm editing text that is made up of separate lines, ideally not more than the width of the terminal, I find it excellent.  It does have a line limit of 128 characters so for continuous prose I will switch to something like Wordstar, but for editing source code and config files on CP/M, it's my first choice.</p>
<p>ED came as standard with CP/M and is only 7k for CP/M 2.2 and 10k for CP/M Plus.  One advantage of ED is that it will work both with teleprinters and video terminals without having to be configured for each device.  It is also good at manipulating large files even when the system is short of memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/cpm_ed_copy_paste.png" title="Copying and Pasting with ED"></p><p>Like many early editors, ED is a modal editor which you start in command mode and while in this mode you can view existing text, move between lines and points in the line.  It allows you to do standard operations such as copy and paste, inserting text from other files, searching for and replacing text, etc.  When we want to enter input mode, we can use the 'I' command.  This is much like VI, except that you can only enter text in the non-command mode but not edit it.  To exit data input mode and return to command mode you use ^Z (CTRL-Z).  These commands can be combined together and one of the most powerful facilities that ED has is the 'M' Macro command to repeat sequences of commands.</p>
<p>Upon executing ED it creates a temporary output file and as you write out from ED it goes to this temporary file.  When editing a file we append text from it into the memory buffer and save to the temporary output file as we go or at the end.</p>
<p>ED keeps track of a number of values such as where it is in the source file,  the line number in the memory buffer and the character pointer (CP) on the line.  These are altered as you move around the file and memory buffer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give a fuller explanation of how to use ED here because the CP/M 2.2 Operating Manual has a good section on the <a href="http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch2.htm">CP/M Editor</a>.  I do, however, want to show it being used properly in the video below.  Further down in this article I have highlighted some useful command sequences.</p>
<h2>An Example Macro</h2>
<p>ED has a macro facility which allows you to repeat a sequence of commands as many times as you like.  This makes it a good example of the power of ED and the following is a typical macro which searches through the memory buffer and displays any occurrences of the text 'CPM', pauses in case you want to stop the macro and then replaces it with 'CP/M'.</p>
<pre><code>MFCPM^Z0TT6Z-3CSCPM^ZCP/M^Z
</code></pre>
<p>The 'M' command will run the sequences of commands that follows it until an error is raised, such as end of file.  If we wanted to we could prepend 'M' with a number to indicate the number of times we want it to run.  I'll break down each command in the sequence below:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td><code>M</code></td><td>Run the following command sequence until an error</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>FCPM^Z</code></td><td>Find 'CPM' and leave Character Pointer (CP) after it</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>0T</code></td><td>Display the line up to CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>T</code></td><td>Display the rest of the line from CP to end </td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>6Z</code></td><td>Pause</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>-3C</code></td><td>Move CP back 3 characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>SCPM^ZCP/M^</code></td><td>Substitute 'CPM' for 'CP/M'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>^Z</code> in the above is CTRL-Z and indicates the end of an argument for a command.</p>
<p>The above macro could also be written:</p>
<pre><code>MFCPM^Z0TT6Z-3DICP/M^Z
</code></pre>
<p>In which case:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td><code>-3D</code></td><td>Delete the 3 previous characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>ICPM^Z</code></td><td>Insert the text 'CP/M'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The video below shows ED being used properly and some of the things that make it great, including searching and replacing text, copying and pasting, macros and handling files bigger than the available memory.</p>
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pqaj050X7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Common Command Sequences</h2>
<p>Below are some useful command command sequences which may be overlooked when reading the manual for ED.</p>
<div><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
  <tr><td>#A</td><td>Load whole file into buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0A</td><td>Load enough of the file to fill half the buffer.  This is great for large files</td></tr>
  <tr><td>#W0A</td><td>Save entire buffer and load more of the source file, enough to fill half of the buffer.  Useful to move through large files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0W</td><td>Write half of the buffer to the new file.  Useful to make room of the buffer is full.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>-B</td><td>Move to end of the last line in the buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0L</td><td>Move CP to beginning of line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>L-2C</td><td>Move to end of line before the &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt; sequence</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0P</td><td>Display page from CP without moving CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0LT</td><td>Move CP to beginning of line and display line (Should this be +/-n ??)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0T</td><td>Type line up to but not including CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0TT</td><td>Type whole line without moving CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0T&lt;cr&gt;T</td><td>Type whole line without moving CP.  Display up to CP on first list and from CP on next line.  This is useful to see where CP is on line.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B#T</td><td>Display the whole buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>KI</td><td>Replace a line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0K</td><td>Delete up to CP on current line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>S^L^Z</td><td>Join current line with next</td></tr>
  <tr><td>I^L^Z</td><td>To split a line at CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0V</td><td>Print free/total memory buffer stats</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0X</td><td>Empties the temporary default exchange file: X$$$$$$$.LIB, used by the <em>X</em> command</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>In the table above the following holds true:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>#</dt><dd>Represents the highest value for n</dd>
  <dt>^L</dt><dd>CTRL-L - Stands for carriage return sequence &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;</dd>
  <dt>^Z</dt><dd>CTRL-Z - Indicates the end of a command's argument</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cr&gt;</dt><dd>Carriage Return - Actually pressing the <em>Return</em> key</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<h2>Do You Like ED Too?</h2>
<p>I know that I'm in the minority, but I'm sure there must be other people who also like ED.  I'd love to hear if I'm not alone in this.  You can leave comments via the links below or via the YouTube video above.</p>

				<div>

            		<p>The new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1">M1 “Apple Silicon”</a> Macs are indeed faster than others in their respective classes. They also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">outperformed a number of higher-classed Mac</a> released just one year ago.</p>
<p>However if you’re depending on command-line applications, things aren’t so pretty. Notably open-source ones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">Gnu’s Compiler Collection</a> is <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=96168#c11">yet to support ARM64 on the Mac</a>. Which is impeding support for many numerical libraries based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a> such as <a href="https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/faq.html#what-is-scipy">SciPy</a>. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)">Homebrew</a> doesn’t fully support the new instruction set:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Warning: You are running macOS on a arm64 CPU architecture.<br>
We do not provide support for this (yet).<br>
Reinstall Homebrew under Rosetta 2 until we support it.<br>
You will encounter build failures with some formulae.<br>
Please create pull requests instead of asking for help on Homebrew’s GitHub,<br>
Twitter or any other official channels. You are responsible for resolving<br>
any issues you experience while you are running this<br>
unsupported configuration.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you can continue using open-source command-line application on your shiny new Apple Silicon Mac? Notably since the first-generation processor is already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/15/m1-chip-emulating-x86-benchmark/">running Intel-based applications faster</a> than most Mac that came before it?</p>
<p>Yes you can, thanks to Rosetta 2. This is the compatibility layer that allows running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_Silicon">Intel-based Mac applications on Apple Silicon</a>. The system is also available for command-line applications, although turning it on would take some work.</p>
<h2>The Rosetta Shell</h2>
<p>When your command-line application or system hasn’t support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM64</a> instruction set, you’ll need to run it from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)">Terminal</a> sessions in Intel mode. That way, all subsequent command line applications started from the shell would be run under Rosetta 2 – including <em>universal binaries</em>. In other words, when an application has <em>both</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel">Intel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Ltd.">Arm</a> variations, the Intel one would be chosen as well as any other child processes of the application.</p>
<p>Here is how you can force the shell to run in Intel mode so that you can continue working in this little command-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)#Rosetta_2">Rosetta</a> Island while waiting for native ARM64 support.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)">Terminal</a> app.
</li>
<li>
Open the Terminal app’s Preferences.
</li>
<li>
Click on the <em>Profiles</em> tab.
</li>
<li>
Select a profile, click on the ellipsis at the bottom of the profile list and then select <em>Duplicate Profile</em>.
</li>
<li>
Click on the new profile and give it a good name. I named mine as “Rosetta Shell”.
</li>
<li>
Also in the new profile, click on the <em>Window</em> tab. In the <em>Title</em>, put a name to indicate that this is for running Intel-based apps. I put “Terminal (Intel)” on mine.
</li>
<li>
Click on the <em>Shell</em> tab and use the following as its <em>Run Command</em> to force the shell run under Rosetta:
<pre>env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh --login
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Untick the <em>Run inside shell</em> checkbox. Clearing the checkbox would prevent running the shell twice, which could bloat your environment variables since <code>~/.zshrc</code> gets run twice.
</li>
<li>
Optionally set this profile as the <em>Default</em>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. The next Terminal window would open the new profile and run command-line applications as Intel binaries.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="run-terminal-rosetta@2x.png" src="https://cutecoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-terminal-rosetta@2x.png" alt="Run shell under Rosetta 2" width="744" height="390" data-lazy-src="https://cutecoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-terminal-rosetta@2x.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<h2>Installing Homebrew</h2>
<p>As of this writing, Homebrew recommends <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">two separate installations</a> for ARM64 systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/local/homebrew</code> – For Intel-only packages, which coincidentally the traditional install location.</li>
<li><code>/opt/homebrew</code> – To install/run packages that already has Apple Silicon support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how you can install Homebrew manually on Apple Silicon systems</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open the Rosetta Shell.
</li>
<li>
Run the following commands:
<pre>cd /usr/local
sudo mkdir homebrew
sudo chgrp admin homebrew
sudo chmod g+rwx homebrew
curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Add the following snippet to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> to automatically choose which Homebrew installation to use depending whether it is running on Rosetta:
<pre>if [ "$(sysctl -n sysctl.proc_translated)" = "1" ]; then
    local brew_path="/usr/local/homebrew/bin"
else
    local brew_path="/opt/homebrew/bin"
fi
export PATH="${brew_path}:${PATH}"
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Try this out and see how it goes. Install your favorite Intel-based command-line applications (suggestion: <code>gcc</code>) and see how it performs. Then have a look at <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">Homebrew’s ARM64 compatibility tracking</a> to see how support for the new processor is going.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation recently released an interchangeable lens camera module based on the Sony&nbsp; IMX477, a 1/2.3″ back side illuminated sensor with 3040×4056 pixels of 1.55um pitch.&nbsp; In this somewhat technical article we will unpack the 12-bit raw still data that it produces and render it in a convenient color space.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4271"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?resize=474%2C313&amp;ssl=1" alt="still life raw capture data file raspberry pi high quality hq cam f/8 1/2s base analog gain iso adobe rgb" width="474" height="313" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?w=1662&amp;ssl=1 1662w, https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?resize=1536%2C1014&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?w=948&amp;ssl=1 948w, https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/StillLife-f8-g1-ARGB.jpg?w=1422&amp;ssl=1 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4271">Figure 1. 12-bit raw capture by Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera with 16 mm kit lens at f/8, 1/2 s, base ISO. The image was loaded into Matlab and rendered Half Height Nearest Neighbor in the Adobe RGB color space with a touch of local contrast and sharpening.&nbsp; Click on it to see it in its own tab and view it at 100% magnification. If your browser is not color managed you may not see colors properly.</figcaption></figure>

<h4>My First Open Source ILC</h4>
<p>When the HQ module was announced a couple of weeks ago I was excited to discover that it came with a CS standard mount, opening the possibility of using any lens ever made with it – as long as it respected back flange limits and an adapter were available.&nbsp; Finally an inexpensive open source ‘camera’ with a decent sensor and interchangeable lenses of potentially photographic quality.</p>
<p>Mine arrived a few days ago.&nbsp; The CS mount affixed to the board has V1.0 2018 markings and it came with a CS-C adapter, which was promptly used to attach the 16mm f/1.4-16 C ‘kit’ lens.&nbsp; The lens is from CGL Electronic Co. LTD, a Chinese company specialized “in the R&amp;D, production and sale of accessories for smartphones, as well as Bluetooth products”.&nbsp; One of their lines is Megapixel CCTV lenses, and this one is spec’d at 10 MP, as printed on the box.&nbsp; What size P that refers to, we are not told.&nbsp; Its field of view is about 27.6 degrees on the diagonal, equivalent to roughly 88mm on Full Frame.</p>
<h4>The Sensor</h4>
<p>The IMX477 was released in December 2016 by Sony.&nbsp; It is a 1/2.3″ 4:3 Back Side Illuminated, Stacked Exmor CMOS sensor designed for “consumer use camcorder” applications, though in this article I will evaluate its ability to capture still images, thus&nbsp; ignoring Sony’s stated use case.&nbsp; Given its tinkering potential, I am sure I will not be the first or last to do so.</p>
<p>There are 3040×4056 pixels usable for imaging, with a 1.55um pitch.&nbsp; This portends a sensor active area of 4.712 x&nbsp; 6.287 mm with a 7.857mm diagonal, implying a 5.51x multiplier compared to, say, a Full Frame Nikon Z7 with 5520×8288 4.35um pixels.</p>
<p>It sports a Bayer Color Filter Array in the BGGR configuration.&nbsp; If the figure reported in the MakerNote is to be trusted, its fully electronic shutter has a minimum speed of&nbsp; 1/8771.9 of a second and it has been clocked at a maximum of 239 s.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is capable of producing 12-bit raw data when in still mode.&nbsp; You can read more about its specs and performance in the <a href="https://www.strollswithmydog.com/pi-hq-cam-sensor-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next article</a>.</p>
<h4>Unpacking the 12-bit Raw Data</h4>
<p>When the -r or –raw switch is used with the Pi’s still image command <strong>raspistill</strong> (see the post scriptum at bottom for raspiraw), 12-bit raw CFA data is appended to the resulting 8 bit jpg file, in a block starting with the characters ‘BRCM’.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first part of the block is a 2^15 byte header, which I ignore, followed by the (3040+16)x(4056+28B) sensor array data written row-wise.&nbsp; The key is realizing that there are 3056 total rows and formatting the data accordingly.</p>
<p>Each row consists of 4056 12-bit elements (4056*12/8 bytes), followed by 12 bytes of zeros and 16 bytes of&nbsp; non-imaging data.&nbsp; The 12 bytes of zeros mark the end of the active area all the way down to the 3040th row.&nbsp; After that there are 16 additional rows of full length system data.&nbsp; In the past this non-imaging system data included optical black pixels that helped determine BlackLevels dynamically, but recent sensors tend not to have clearly demarcated such patches and I was not able to identify them.&nbsp; Should you know more about these service rows and columns I would be interested in the details.</p>
<p>From the start of every row to the twelve zeros, pixel raw values are packed in triplets: three 8-bit bytes are written for every two&nbsp; 12-bit pixels in the following format</p>
<p>AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB BBBBAAAA</p>
<p>The first two bytes represent the 8 individual&nbsp; high bits while the third one contains the 4×2 respective low bits as shown.&nbsp; Unpacking them is easily accomplished in Matlab (and with a bit of adaptation Octave or your interpreter of choice)<sup><a title="The Matlab/Octave function used in this page to open, unpack and render full resolution Raspberry Pi HQ Camera 12-bit raw stills created by raspistill -r&nbsp; and raspiraw can be downloaded from here." href="#footnote">[1]</a></sup> as follows, vector ‘bin’ holds pixel data row-wise:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4276" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4276"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Unpack12bitRaw.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Unpack12bitRaw.png?resize=474%2C59&amp;ssl=1" alt="matlab octave code unpack raspberry pi hq high quality camera raw file jpg jpeg 12 bit " width="474" height="59" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Unpack12bitRaw.png?w=559&amp;ssl=1 559w, https://i0.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Unpack12bitRaw.png?resize=300%2C37&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4276">Figure 2. Unpacking 12 bit raw data loaded from Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera jpeg generated by raspistill -r.&nbsp; Full Matlab code available at the bottom of the article.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The full function used in this page can be downloaded from the link at the end of the article.&nbsp; So now we have the Pi HQ Camera’s 12-bit raw CFA data in 16-bit integer format.</p>

<p>There is very little information in the jpeg Exif tags and some of it is incorrect unless explicitly set by the user.&nbsp; For instance any information related to the lens, like focal length or f-number, because the module and the lens don’t speak to each other.&nbsp; The goodies are instead in the<strong> MakerNotes</strong>, where we can find white balance multipliers, a compromise color matrix and more.&nbsp; The field is made up of a few hundred characters, here is the one from the capture in Figure 3 below:</p>
<p>ev=-1 mlux=-1<br>
exp=900 ag=256 focus=255<br>
gain_r=3.238 gain_b=1.515 greenness=0 ccm=8466,-3816,-550,-476,6390,-1816,302,-1790,5588,0,0,0 md=0 tg=247 247 oth=247 216 b=0 f=247 247 fi=0<br>
ISP Build Date: Feb 12 2020, 12:39:13 VC_BUILD_ID_VERSION: 53a54c770c493957d99bf49762dfabc4eee00e45 (clean) VC_BUILD_ID_USER: dom VC_BUILD_ID_BRANCH: master</p>
<p>Ignore ev (EC) and mlux, which appear fixed.&nbsp; Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>exp</strong> is Exposure Time in microseconds</li>
<li><strong>ag</strong> divided by 256 is Analog Gain, related to ISO, so in this case it had a value of 1 (the range is 1 to 16)</li>
<li><strong>gain_r</strong> and <strong>gain_b</strong> are the white balance multipliers; greenness has so far always been zero in my experience</li>
<li><strong>ccm</strong> is the Compromise Color Matrix, divide by 4096 and drop the last row of offsets that in my tests has always been zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know what the rest of the entries are but I suspect they are related to automatic exposure because they all turn to zero when that mode is turned off (-ex off, undocumented but all I use).</p>
<h4>Decoding the Matrix</h4>
<p>The matrix in the MakerNote looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sRGB-Matrix.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sRGB-Matrix.png?resize=284%2C53&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="284" height="53" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>It changes with the lighting, so I would guess that the module interpolates it based on the estimated illuminant.&nbsp; Where does this matrix take us?&nbsp; It looks very much like a demosaiced, white-balanced data to sRGB matrix.</p>
<p>To find out I took my setup to the balcony in a veiled, sunny, city afternoon to capture a purposely slightly defocused ColorChecker 24 target.&nbsp; Here is the image produced by the Pi’s GPU-accelerated on-board engine, straight Out Of Camera:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4281"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?resize=474%2C355&amp;ssl=1" alt="out of camera ooc raw capture cc24 colorchecker whibal base analgo gain iso slightly out of focus oof raspberry pi hq cam high quality" width="474" height="355" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?resize=1601%2C1200&amp;ssl=1 1601w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?resize=1536%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?w=1900&amp;ssl=1 1900w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?w=948&amp;ssl=1 948w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/piHQ-CC24-a.jpg?w=1422&amp;ssl=1 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4281">Figure 3. Out of Camera sRGB jpeg image produced by raspistill -r with a Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera and 16mm CS lens at f/5.6. It is purposedly defocused to smooth out the impact of irregularities in the patches.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It looks a bit desaturated.&nbsp; Extracting the raw values of the 24 CC patches as described in the article on <a href="https://www.strollswithmydog.com/determining-forward-color-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">determining the Forward Matrix</a> we obtain the following fit against BabelColor’s 30 database, assuming about a 5800K D illuminant, as suggested by the color meter:</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Full-Matrix.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Full-Matrix.png?resize=474%2C502&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="474" height="502" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Full-Matrix.png?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Full-Matrix.png?resize=283%2C300&amp;ssl=1 283w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The white-balanced data to sRGB matrix looks fairly similar to the one in the HQ Camera’s MakerNotes, suggesting that its purpose is indeed the same, something I have since confirmed with subsequent captures.&nbsp; A Sensitivity Metamerism Index (SMI) of 88 indicates a pretty good fit – thus colorimetrically friendly CFA dies, well done!&nbsp; &nbsp;These are the dE2000 errors for the target under the current D5800 illuminant and the white balanced ‘raw’ to XYZ Forward Matrix above:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4289"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/dE2000.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/dE2000.png?resize=461%2C288&amp;ssl=1" alt="raspberry pi high quality hq cam base analog gain iso deltaE 2000 raw capture CC24 colorchecker CFA SSF spectral sensitivity functions" width="461" height="288" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/dE2000.png?w=461&amp;ssl=1 461w, https://i2.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/dE2000.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4289">Figure 4. CIEDE2000 difference from BabelColor30 ColorChecker database reference data when the derived matrix was applied to the relative raw capture. It indicates a very good fit, suggesting colorimetrically friendly CFA spectral sensitivity functions in the HQ camera.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Very good results.&nbsp; Using the D5800 Forward Matrix so discovered we can easily calculate matrices for any of the standard color spaces around this color temperature, as described in the linked article.</p>
<h4>Rendering 12-bit Raw Data to sRGB</h4>
<p>We now have the raw data, white balance multipliers and matrix necessary to render the captured raw image to a final color space.&nbsp; I used simplified demosaicing that results in a half height image with every final pixel corresponding to a BGGR quartet in the CFA, similar to dcraw -h.&nbsp; Each color channel within a pixel maintains the relative BlackLevel subtracted ‘raw’ R and B values while the two G values are averaged, as described in the <a href="https://www.strollswithmydog.com/raw-file-conversion-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article on rendering</a>:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4400"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Half-Demosaic-HQ.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Half-Demosaic-HQ.png?resize=474%2C99&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="474" height="99" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Half-Demosaic-HQ.png?w=670&amp;ssl=1 670w, https://i1.wp.com/www.strollswithmydog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Half-Demosaic-HQ.png?resize=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4400">Figure 5.

<p>Much better, though we know from previous posts that this linear rendition probably still needs to be mapped into the smaller Contrast Ratio of typical display devices with the help of a Tone Mapping Operator or, at the very least, a bit of contrast.</p>
<h4>And Full-Rez to Adobe RGB</h4>
<p>Of course after doing all that it becomes apparent that the small size of the HQ’s pixels bump against their physical limitations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Images from this sensor are bound to look a bit fuzzy and noisy compared to those produced by larger cousins of similar resolution when demosaiced to full size and shown at 100%:&nbsp; there are only so many photoelectrons to be captured and diffraction to be oversampled when you are 1.55 …</p></div></div>

<p>Hey, you. Yeah, you. With the pajamas. I know you haven’t washed them in a few weeks, I can feel the smell from all the way in Canada. And I get it. Because I’m wearing my pajamas right now and I haven’t washed them in a while either. We’re all in this together, so lets parse this out a little bit.</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit and we all got permission to work from home, you were probably extatic. “This is awesome,” you thought, “PAJAMAS!” But it’s not that simple. Without the energy of the office environment it’s kinda hard to get into the groove. And yes, the modern open floor plan isn’t ideal for focused work and we used to gripe about that, but not seeing anyone for weeks on end gets old quickly.</p>



<p>When no one is watching, it’s way to easy to check out Hacker News or Twitter or Reddit for a little while and then go down a rabbit hole of understanding how exactly how those mRNA vaccines work or what’s the latest projected layout of Starship is. Hours, days, sometimes weeks go by like that.</p>



<p>Without the discipline annoyingly imposed by the office environment, we’re left to our own devices, our own discipline and we often find it lacking. Instead of making actual progress on our work, we submit vague progress reports and list the problems we encounter all the while building up shame, guilt and fear.</p>



<p>Emotions are a funny thing though, especially negative emotions. We don’t like ’em. And we’d do anything to not feel them. So when the guilt, shame and that quiet terror of being found out come up, we want to run away. And what’s a better refuge than the conveniently endless feeds on social media (not to mention the autoplaying Youtube videos)?</p>



<p>But wait a sec, didn’t we just say that the guilt <em>started</em> with procrastination? Is it also causing it? Oh, now we’re in deep. Real deep.</p>



<p>I don’t know if your boss actually knows you’ve been <s>lying</s> massaging the truth. She’s likely in the same boat, fighting the same demons, too preoccupied with her own procrastination to notice yours. But <em>you</em> know, and so do your pajamas. This positive feedback loop between negative emotions and procrastination is only going to get worse – unless you do something.</p>



<p>The problem with emotions is that we only know two ways to deal with them – express them or supress them (by distracting ourselves). And neither gets us the result we are looking for, which is breaking out of the cycle.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a third option, not commonly taught and not well understood outside of postmodern new age circles. Emotions can be <em>released</em>. Releasing emotions isn’t about expressing them, talking about them or thinking about them. It’s about allowing ourselves to feel them, fully, staying with the unpleasantness for as long as neccessary. And letting them evaporate. It’s as natural as taking a shit, but unfortunately we’ve been taught to keep emotions bottled up (especially the men among us). Imagine eating without ever taking a dump. Yeah, that’s what holding on to emotions feels like.</p>



<p>The easiest way to release emotions is to ask yourself a simple question:</p>



<p><em>Could you allow yourself to feel this fear/anger/guilt?</em></p>



<p>Contemplate this question. Don’t try to derive an answer, the answer itself isn’t important. Let the question bounce around inside your head for a little while. You may feel something starting to shift.</p>



<p>For some of you, perhaps those who’ve had experience with meditation or therapy, this should be enough. Others need a lot more guidance.</p>



<p>That’s why I build <a href="https://wuju.app/">Wuju</a>, an app that can help you process and <em>release</em> emotions. My stats of around 2000 people show it can drop the intensity of any negative emotion by up to 90% within a few minutes. If you’re stuck in a procrastination loop, it might be worth a try.</p>



<p>(Wuju is subscription based, but you can try it for as long as you need to see if it works for you.)</p>

Could your work be permanently remote? Here are some pieces of information that can help you determine this!

</p>
<br>
<div><p>By <b>Ashley Campbell</b></p><div><p>2020 has seen many of our jobs completely change. The coronavirus and </p><u><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">Covid-19 pandemic</a></u><p> has wrought havoc with businesses operating in all sorts of industries. In order to comply with government guidelines and restrictions, many businesses have now had to switch to having their staff work on a remote basis, as they are unable to have everyone operating with a two meters distance between them at all times in office spaces and other commercial premises. In some ways, this is great. Working from home is seen as desirable and preferable by many employees. It cuts out expensive and time consuming commutes that have proven bad for employee health. It cuts out rushed lunch breaks with low quality packed lunches, as staff can prepare their lunch at home in their own kitchens. It also proves beneficial for the business in terms of profit margins, as it cuts out the costs and overheads associated with renting commercial property. But is remote work here to stay and could your job become permanently remote? Here are a few pieces of information that could help you determine this!</p></div><h3>Ask Your Employer Their Intentions</h3><div><p>The easiest and most trustworthy way to determine whether your job is going to become permanently remote is to </p><u><a href="https://www.careeraddict.com/talk-to-boss#:~:text=When%20you%20are%20talking%20to,and%20lean%20into%20the%20conversation." target="_blank">ask your employer</a></u><p> yourself. If they have a plan, they may be able to provide you with a straightforward yes or no answer to your question, which will allow you to prepare yourself for the change, or - if you are unhappy with the change - you can start seeking employment elsewhere. Nobody other than your employer will have a 100% certain answer as to whether your position will remain remote or not.</p></div><h3>Look at What Other Companies Are Doing</h3><div><p>If you notice that many competitor companies or similar companies in your field or industry are switching to operating on a permanently remote basis, chances are your company could be heading in a similar direction. Watching developments will give you a good indication of what the general trend in your field is. For example, </p><u><a href="https://precisionlabtesting.com/2020/09/25/blood-testing-for-traveling-physicians/" target="_blank">This Company</a></u><p> has developed blood tests that doctors can carry out outside of clinics, meaning that the trend towards staying home rather than venturing out seems to be continuing, even in the field of healthcare itself.</p></div><h3>Consider Whether It Is Benefiting Your Company</h3><p>If remote work is benefiting your company, chances are it’s here to stay. If the company is generating the same sales and profits, but has fewer outgoings due to remote work cutting rent and overhead costs, chances are the owners and managers will be content with things continuing this way. If the company is constantly facing security threats, data breaches and other issues, it’s likely they will be working to get back on site as soon as possible.</p><p>Remote work suits some people. It doesn’t suit others. Either way, you’re going to want to know whether you’ll be continuing to work remotely or not. Hopefully, some of the above advice will help you to get some answers!</p></div></div>

<p>What would you do if I gave you $1 million today on the condition that you invest it entirely in the stock market?</p>

<p>First off, you’d probably find someone who knows way more about investing and get some
professional advice.</p>

<p>But in lieu of that, you’d divide your money among a variety of bets:</p>

<p>Stable companies with a history of profitability, growth-stage companies with a high tolerance
for risk, and maybe a few companies you just personally believe have
potential.</p>

<p>In short, you’d diversify.</p>

<p>The thought of putting all $1 million into a single company <em>probably</em> wouldn’t cross your mind.</p>

<p>Someday soon, I’d like to think a year of my time will be “worth” more than $1
million. So I won’t be putting it all into a single company either.</p>

<p>Instead I’ll build a startup a month for the next year.</p>

<h2 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h2>

<p>The first person to popularize building <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/" alt="12 startups in 12 months (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">12 startups in 12 months</a>
 is Pieter Levels, who
launched products like NomadList and RemoteOK in 2014.</p>

<p>Since he operates both as <a href="https://nomadlist.com/open" alt="open (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">open</a>
 <a href="https://remoteok.io/open" alt="startups (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">startups</a>
 we know they make a combined $600,000 per year.</p>

<p>Not bad for a solo founder with a part-time sys admin.</p>

<p>In the 5 years since, several others have taken the same challenge.</p>

<p>Jon Yongfook <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html" alt="started (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">started</a>

at the end of 2018, and eventually founded BannerBear. In the year he’s been
working on it, it’s grown to <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/mojosaas" alt="$5.1K MRR (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">$5.1K MRR</a>
 (monthly recurring revenue).</p>

<p>When I was chatting with Dominic Monn about the idea, he told me he’s had success with this approach too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did something along the same lines where I launched 6 things in about 6 months in 2018 and <a href="https://mentorcruise.com/" alt="two (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">two</a>
 <a href="https://remoteml.com/" alt="things (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">things</a>
 grew out of it that make around $3.5k MRR together today, and some of the others I sold for a cumulative 5 figures as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The common thread is that no one doing the challenge completes it.</p>

<p>Building 12 startups isn’t actually the goal.</p>

<p>The goal is to eliminate the most common blockers from shipping a product:
failure to stick to an MVP and finish something, fear of shipping, launching, charging money, and so forth.</p>

<p>Now, each of these things has to happen inside a month.</p>

<p><strong>The idea is that a fixed timespan helps you <em>quickly</em> find a few ideas worthy of your undivided focus.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of spending years working on an idea that won’t pan out.</p>

<p>I’m under no illusion that since Pieter’s very public success, a ton of people
have undergone the same challenge.</p>

<p>Few, if any, have seen the same financial outcomes thus far. The majority still work their
day jobs. And a quick search on Google reveals that most people don’t make it past the
first 2-3 startups.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve adapted the challenge to tip the odds in my favor.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone">It’s dangerous to go alone</h2>

<p>In <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36291655-lost-and-founder" target="_blank">Lost and Founder</a></em>, Rand Fishkin, former CEO of Moz, writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s one of the biggest things I’ve learned about startups: it’s dangerous to go alone. You want people around you who’ve been through this before and are willing to openly share their experiences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the main difference in our approach to building
12 startups in 12 months: We’re not going alone.</p>

<p><strong>We’ve created 12x Startup: A cohort of 4 motivated makers, each building their own “one startup per month”.</strong></p>

<p>Each day, we post our current task on our public <a href="https://12xstartup.com/" target="_blank">status page</a>. We correspond regularly in Slack, challenge each other’s ideas, and plan
to livestream our monthly demo sessions for you to tune into.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/12xstartup.jpg" alt="12x Startup Homepage"></p>

<p>Apart from those of us who’ve built other types of profitable projects before,
we’re also inviting advisors who’re a bit further down the path than us.</p>

<p>This approach was inspired by my experience with <a href="https://medium.com/@rrhoover/turn-your-side-project-into-a-company-introducing-weekend-build-c70aebc6d716" target="_blank">Weekend Build</a>.</p>

<p>Knowing that I had to present progress every week to the group was a healthy
amount of pressure.</p>

<p>Having other makers to learn from, plus expert advice
from Ryan and Vedika, changed the trajectory of our <a href="https://affilimate.com/" alt="affiliate analytics tool (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">affiliate analytics tool</a>
 in 8 weeks.</p>

<p>But I can’t shake the feeling…I’ve made building my first profitable startup much harder than it has to be.</p>

<p>If there were a master list of first-time founder mistakes, I’d
probably check most of the boxes.</p>

<p>18 months into that project and I’m not giving up.</p>

<p>But I am giving myself room to experiment.</p>

<h2 id="define-startup">Define startup</h2>

<p>So what “counts” as a startup? In his <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/" target="_blank">original post</a>, Pieter addresses the myth that a startup has to begin
as a world-changing company with $1B valuation potential.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it’s become clearer than ever that self-funded businesses
starting small can become highly successful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product Hunt <a href="https://ryanhoover.me/post/69599262875/product-hunt-began-as-an-email-list" target="_blank">began as a newsletter</a> and was later acquired by AngelList</li>
<li>NomadList <a href="https://nomadlist.com/faq" target="_blank">started as a Google Sheet</a> and
now nets over $300K/year</li>
<li>Basecamp <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first/" alt="originated as a whitepaper (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">originated as a whitepaper</a>
 and today serves 2M+ users</li>
<li>Baremetrics v1 was <a href="https://github.com/Baremetrics/baremetrics-v1" alt="built in a weekend (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">built in a weekend</a>
 and now $1.5M ARR</li>
</ul>

<p>So for the purpose of 12x Startup, here’s my personal definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An idea in the form of a product that resonates so deeply with a target
market of sufficient size, it’s worth seeing where you can take it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, to summarize in a word: Momentum.</p>

<p>The first evidence of momentum among my projects came in May when I <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/launch-a-newsletter/" target="_blank">launched my newsletter</a>. In just 5 months, it’s grown to over 3.8K subscribers with next to zero marketing.</p>

<p>When there’s momentum behind what you’re creating, my suspicion is you <em>just
know it</em>.</p>

<p>That’s a bit like what I’m looking for, within a few constraints.</p>

<h2 id="the-multitude-of-paths-to-a-million-dollars-a-year">The multitude of paths to a million dollars a year</h2>

<p>Let’s come back to that $1 million investment we were talking about.</p>

<p>In 2018, 17 course creators made over
<a href="https://teachable.com/blog/teachable-this-year" target="_blank">$1 million on Teachable</a>.
Fast forward to 2020, and 12 creators made over $1 million
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ankurnagpal/status/1296841441575133186" target="_blank">during just the second quarter</a>. There are people doing the same on platforms like <a href="https://gaps.com/patreon-earners/" target="_blank">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/writers-have-been-trying-to-support-online-themselves-for" target="_blank">Substack</a>.</p>

<p>That is to say, you can make <em>a lot</em> of money by selling information-based products (“info products”) like
ebooks, online courses, substack subscriptions, and so forth.</p>

<p>Plus, you also don’t have to be in the top 1% to do well. As the popular essay
explains, you just need <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank">1,000 true fans</a> (or perhaps <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/" target="_blank">only 100</a>).</p>

<p>That’s why it’s popular advice to start with a small ebook or a mini course before graduating to SaaS.</p>

<p>Building a SaaS product is just a <em>much, much</em> slower and more difficult path to a
million dollars or even “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html" target="_blank">ramen profitability</a>”.</p>

<p>A quick ebook launch can put thousands of dollars in your pocket in
a matter of weeks and fund the next venture.</p>

<p>In comparison, our first $2K in SaaS revenue took almost a year to arrive.</p>

<p><strong>Which is to say, I didn’t follow any of this advice about starting small and building
a tiny info product.</strong></p>

<p>Like developers do, I dove headfirst into building something out of software.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons I think I made the right decision, and will continue to do
so for the 12x challenge.</p>

<p>Here are the top two:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Comfort can lead to complacency.</strong> I saw this happen when my travel blog reached
$5K/mo in revenue before the pandemic. It’s so easy to lose momentum when something “easy”
is already working and growing, <em>especially</em> when building a SaaS product is inherently difficult.</li>
<li><strong>It’s hard to value an info product-based business.</strong> Companies are valued based on future
earning potential. But here you’re making money based on a cycle of launches,
where you constantly have to create new material. I want to build “12x startups” I <em>could</em> sell,
if I wanted to.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I had to add a third, it’d be that it’s just more fun to build
software products.</p>

<p>I’m a developer afterall :)</p>

<h2 id="the-12x-rules-of-engagement">The 12x rules of engagement</h2>

<p>With these motivations in mind, I’ve placed the following constraints on my <em>personal</em> attempt at the 12 startups in 12 months challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li>No single-sale info products</li>
<li>Doesn’t depend on me, personally, to run it for it to be valuable</li>
<li>Low technical complexity</li>
<li>For most products, a way to test willingness to pay</li>
<li>Testable, scalable traction channels</li>
<li>A growth plan that can be sustained after the month ends</li>
<li>At least one product’s lowest price is a no-brainer at $99/mo</li>
<li>Experiment with both B2B and B2C</li>
<li>Some must leverage my unfair advantages</li>
</ul>

<p>To elaborate on the last point: I have other unique skills, connections, and
advantages above other people who might build the same products.</p>

<p>This includes things like my existing following on Twitter and my newsletter,
experience working in a high-growth tech company, and an existing SaaS codebase
full of reusable material.</p>

<p>I’m not here to prove you can build a startup in a vacuum.</p>

<h2 id="12-startups-in-12-months">12 Startups in 12 Months</h2>

<p>Keeping with tradition, this article will be updated on a monthly basis with each
startup I add to my personal portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>Initial idea:</strong> I’ve been all over the map in terms of my plans for a community for subscribers
of the Blogging for Devs newsletter.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to do a small group of women who blog. Then I had so many requests for a Slack or
Discord that I ended up launching a free, invite-only community built on <a href="http://circle.so/" target="_blank">Circle</a>,
capped at 100 free members.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-pro-screenshot.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community"></p>

<p>This month, I’ll convert it to a <strong>paid community</strong> for future members and adding more community features and premium content.</p>

<p>(You could say it’s cheating slightly because I’m not starting from scratch, but I’m losing 10 days of the month to my only vacation this year so 🤷🏻‍♀️)</p>

<p>Here’s my planned scope of work for the next four weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li>✨ <strong>Landing Page</strong> — A landing page to build a waitlist already exists <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/community/" target="_blank">over here</a>,
but it’ll need improvements and a way to pay and become a member.</li>
<li>🛠 <strong>Unified Experience</strong> — Each member will have a single login to the Community forums on
Circle and the Website, where all the other content will live. This means migrating existing members.</li>
<li>📅 <strong>Events System</strong> — We’ve had a few great virtual events, I want to build something simple
that lets me schedule events, members can RSVP, and get a calendar invite.</li>
<li>🎉 <strong>Member Feed and Goals</strong> — Something where you can see what everyone in the community
has published recently and set and see your progress towards Goals for yourself …</li></ul></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The other day, I got an email from Edd, an OpenBSD user, claiming that Samba would crash when serving files off an MS-DOS filesystem. This was Samba built from sources and not the one from ports. Since I use myself Samba a lot and for a quite large user base, I got interested in the issue and started investigating it. What I found out in the end is a surprise and was not expected: A bug that has been there in all BSDs for almost all the time, since the 4.2BSD times or for roughly 25 years... </p>
<!--break-->
<h2>The Samba Directory Cache</h2>
<p>The Problem With seekdir() In Samba's replacement code I found the following comment, stating the problem from the Samba point of view:</p>
<pre>"This is needed because the existing directory handling in FreeBSD
 and OpenBSD (and possibly NetBSD) doesn't correctly handle unlink()
 on files in a directory where telldir() has been used. On a block
 boundary it will occasionally miss a file when seekdir() is used to
 return to a position previously recorded with telldir().

 This also fixes a severe performance and memory usage problem with
 telldir() on BSD systems. Each call to telldir() in BSD adds an
 entry to a linked list, and those entries are cleaned up on
 closedir(). This means with a large directory closedir() can take an
 arbitrary amount of time, causing network timeouts as millions of
 telldir() entries are freed"
</pre><p>Apparently there are two problems: seekdir() not returning to the position initially retrieved using telldir() and a performance problem. Before digging to much into source code, I decided to check the documentation of said functions, just to make sure, they were being used like they are meant to be used. The OpenBSD manual page is clear: The <strong>seekdir()</strong> function sets the position of the next <strong>readdir()</strong> operation on the named directory stream dirp. The new position reverts to the one associated with the directory stream when the <strong>telldir()</strong> operation was performed. Values returned by <strong>telldir()</strong> are good only for the lifetime of the DIR pointer, dirp, from which they are derived. If the directory is closed and then reopened, the <strong>telldir()</strong> value may be invalidated due to undetected directory compaction. If you don't close the directory stream, seekdir() will take you back to the position previsouly obtained using telldir(). If the system behaves differently, then it's either a bug or the documentation is wrong. If the system indeed does not take you back to the right position, why do we have these functions then in the first place? A look at the closedir() function in OpenBSD reveals that the statement made by the Samba people about performance in closedir() is wrong: In OpenBSD there is no linked list, but a smarter memory handling scheme implemented by Otto Moerbeek (otto@). FreeBSD, however, uses a linked list indeed, but they can switch to our code at any time. So the performance problem really is a non-issue.</p>
<h2>Hunting the seekdir() Bug</h2>
<p><em>As the original author of the *dir() library, you probably fixed one of my bugs :-) Prior to the *dir() commands, programs just opened, read, and interpreted directories directly. I had to update a shocking 22 programs (a large percentage of the programs available on UNIX at the time) to replace their direct interpretation of directories with the *dir() library calls. (Kirk McKusick; private communication) </em></p>
<p>What I needed is a test program to exercise these functions an eventually trigger the behaviour that prevented the Samba people from enabling a directory cache on BSD systems. I wrote a C program that approximately does the following steps:</p>
<ol><li>Create a directory and populate it with a certain number of files</li>
<li>Iterate over the directory using readdir(), recording the position of the entry using telldir() before readdir(), and storing the obtained values in an array</li>
<li>Delete a random number of files and also mark them as deleted in the in-memory array</li>
<li>Iterate over the in-memory array, skipping the entries marked as deleted, and seekdir() to the others, doing a readdir() and compare the returned values with the in-memory copy</li>
<li>Output a message when the in-memory copy and the value returned by readdir() are different</li>
</ol><p>Jeremy told me that the problem occurs with large directories, so I began my tests with really large directories (up to 250'000 entries) and quite quickly I hit the issue. seekdir() won't return me to the recorded position. This kind of confirmed the problem the Samba people were seeing for more than three years. I tweaked the values of my test program, to see if I can find a pattern. But looking at thousands of directory positions, filenames, inode numbers where more likely to turn me mad than to spot the problem... I started lowering the numbers and to my surprise, I could trigger the problem with as little as 10 or 20 files and deleting just one of them. Suddenly, I had a case that shows the problem on every run, no more randomness: Create 28 files, delete file 25 and seekdir to file 26: You end up at file 27! Staring at the output of my program I suddenly saw the pattern as clear as can be: Creating the directory with 28 files had created a directory that spans more than one block on the disk (2 in this case). File 25 was the first entry of the second block. Obviously the problem occured when you delete the first entry in a block of a directory and then return to the recorded position of the second entry in the same block. This would actually get you one entry to far. By that time I had involved Otto to give me a hand and to confirm my findings. His first reaction: An interesting problem... ;) We investigated further and I began looking at the kernel code that removes a directory entry as well as the library code in libc that implements seekdir() and friends.</p>
<h2>How the Kernel Removed Directory Entries</h2>
<p>The kernel function to remove a directory entry, ufs_dirremove(), indeed treats entries that are located at the beginning of a block differently than others:</p>
<pre>        if (dp-&gt;i_count == 0) {
                /*
                 * First entry in block: set d_ino to zero.
                 */
                ep-&gt;d_ino = 0;
        } else {
                /*
                 * Collapse new free space into previous entry.
                 */
                ep-&gt;d_reclen += dp-&gt;i_reclen;
        }
</pre><p>If it is the first entry in a block, the inode number is set to zero, thus invalidating the entry. For all other entries, the record length of the to-be-deleted record is added to the record length of the previous entry. Since the library uses the record length field of an entry to proceed to the next entry in readdir(), this effectively means that the removed entry, while it is still in the block on disc, will no longer be used.</p>
<h2>How the C Library Accesses Directory Entries</h2>
<p>The C library implements the opendir(), telldir(), readdir(), seekdir(), and closedir() functions. These functions were written in the 4.2BSD times so that UNIX programs don't need to handle directories by themselves.</p>
<pre>/*
 * get next entry in a directory.
 */
int
_readdir_unlocked(DIR *dirp, struct dirent **result)
{
        struct dirent *dp;

        *result = NULL;
        for (;;) {
                if (dirp-&gt;dd_loc &gt;= dirp-&gt;dd_size)
                        dirp-&gt;dd_loc = 0;
                if (dirp-&gt;dd_loc == 0) {
                        dirp-&gt;dd_size = getdirentries(dirp-&gt;dd_fd,
                            dirp-&gt;dd_buf, dirp-&gt;dd_len, &amp;dirp-&gt;dd_seek);
                        if (dirp-&gt;dd_size == 0)
                                return (0);
                        if (dirp-&gt;dd_size &lt; 0)
                                return (-1);
                }
                dp = (struct dirent *)(dirp-&gt;dd_buf + dirp-&gt;dd_loc);
                if ((long)dp &amp; 03)      /* bogus pointer check */
                        return (-1);
                if (dp-&gt;d_reclen &lt;= 0 ||
                    dp-&gt;d_reclen &gt; dirp-&gt;dd_len + 1 - dirp-&gt;dd_loc)
                        return (-1);
                dirp-&gt;dd_loc += dp-&gt;d_reclen;
                 if (dp-&gt;d_ino == 0)
                        continue;
                *result = dp;
                return (0);
        }
}
</pre><p>At first sight, this code looks correct. It will skip deleted entries that have their inode number set to zero and it will use the record lenght otherwise. And since a directory traversal using readdir() works just fine, this is code effectively works. A close look at the seekdir() library implementation finally reveals the problem:</p>
<pre>/*
 * seek to an entry in a directory.
 * Only values returned by "telldir" should be passed to seekdir.
 */
void
__seekdir(DIR *dirp, long loc)
{
        struct ddloc *lp;
        struct dirent *dp;

        if (loc &lt; 0 || loc &gt;= dirp-&gt;dd_td-&gt;td_loccnt)
                return;
        lp = &amp;dirp-&gt;dd_td-&gt;td_locs[loc];
        dirp-&gt;dd_td-&gt;td_last = loc;
        if (lp-&gt;loc_loc == dirp-&gt;dd_loc &amp;&amp; lp-&gt;loc_seek == dirp-&gt;dd_seek)
                return;
        (void) lseek(dirp-&gt;dd_fd, (off_t)lp-&gt;loc_seek, SEEK_SET);
        dirp-&gt;dd_seek = lp-&gt;loc_seek;
        dirp-&gt;dd_loc = 0;
        while (dirp-&gt;dd_loc &lt; lp-&gt;loc_loc) {
                _readdir_unlocked(dirp, &amp;dp);
                if (dp == NULL)
                        break;
        }
}
</pre><p>This code will not work as expected when seeking to the second entry of a block where the first has been deleted: seekdir() calls readdir() which happily skips the first entry (it has inode set to zero), and advance to the second entry. When the user now calls readdir() to read the directory entry to which he just seekdir()ed, he does not get the second entry but the third. Much to my surprise I not only found this problem in all other BSDs or BSD derived systems like Mac OS X, but also in very old BSD versions. I first checked 4.4BSD Lite 2, and Otto confirmed it is also in 4.2BSD. The bug has been around for roughly 25 years or more.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Intel NUC <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/76978/">D34010WYK</a> has a LAN port with two integrated LEDs. Both are permanently on when a connection is established, with one LED blinking on network activity. This can be rather distracting, particularly at night. So I went on to figure out how to disable the LEDs. It's a general solution that should work with every OS, every NUC, and every somewhat recent Intel NIC (Network Interface Card). Perhaps most devices with an Intel Ethernet controller.</p>
<p>The most obvious and low-tech solution is to tape the LEDs. I haven't tried as an observation led me on a different path. I noticed that a few seconds into booting Ubuntu, the LEDs are briefly switched off. I concluded this must be done through software somehow. This didn't turn out to be entirely correct or useful, as the driver (kernel module) merely resets the controller when it loads, but made me curious enough to proceed.</p>
<p>First, a step back to know the controller used in the NUC.</p>
<p>$ lspci | grep Ethernet
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I218-V (rev 04)</p>
<p>Intel ARK has <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/71305/">more information</a>, including a very detailed 262-pages datasheet, which will prove essential.</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>I wondered if the option to disable LEDs is perhaps provided through a kernel module parameter. I already knew the  module name for recent Intel Ethernet devices: <i>e1000e</i>. If I hadn't, <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/search?keyword=I218">searching</a> the Intel Download Center for <i>I218</i> and filtering for <i>Linux</i> tells the same. And sure enough, the module is loaded.</p>
<p>$ lsmod | grep e1000e
e1000e                226396  0
ptp                    19395  1 e1000e</p>
<p>Many parameters, but none to change the behavior of LEDs. As confirmed by the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/e1000e.txt">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>$ modinfo -p e1000e
debug:Debug level (0=none,...,16=all) (int)
copybreak:Maximum size of packet that is copied to a new buffer on receive (uint)
TxIntDelay:Transmit Interrupt Delay (array of int)
TxAbsIntDelay:Transmit Absolute Interrupt Delay (array of int)
RxIntDelay:Receive Interrupt Delay (array of int)
RxAbsIntDelay:Receive Absolute Interrupt Delay (array of int)
InterruptThrottleRate:Interrupt Throttling Rate (array of int)
IntMode:Interrupt Mode (array of int)
SmartPowerDownEnable:Enable PHY smart power down (array of int)
KumeranLockLoss:Enable Kumeran lock loss workaround (array of int)
WriteProtectNVM:Write-protect NVM [WARNING: disabling this can lead to corrupted NVM] (array of int)
CrcStripping:Enable CRC Stripping, disable if your BMC needs the CRC (array of int)</p>
<p>It turns out such a parameter was <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/e1000/feature-requests/2/">requested</a> years ago, but denied by Intel with the following explanation.</p>
<p><span></span><span>I'm sorry, but this feature request was evaluated and denied because the majority of our customers require the LEDs to function as-is, and module parameters of this type are unacceptable.</span><span></span></p>
<p>So I downloaded the kernel model <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/15817">source</a>, hoping to modify it, and eventually noticed a promising function.</p>
<p>
static s32 e1000_led_off_pchlan(struct e1000_hw *hw)
{
    u16 data = (u16)hw-&gt;mac.ledctl_mode1;
    u32 i, led;

    
    if (!(er32(STATUS) &amp; E1000_STATUS_LU)) {
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
            led = (data &gt;&gt; (i * 5)) &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_MASK; 
            if ((led &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_MODE_MASK) !=
                E1000_LEDCTL_MODE_LINK_UP)
                continue;
            if (led &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT)
                data &amp;= ~(E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT &lt;&lt; (i * 5));
            else
                data |= (E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT &lt;&lt; (i * 5));
        }
    }

    return e1e_wphy(hw, HV_LED_CONFIG, data);
}</p><p>Perhaps more complex than you'd expect such a simple task to be. Many constants and bit operations. Lots more in related functions. I figured this must be documented, presumably in the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/i218-ethernet-connection-datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a>. Browsing it cut my plans to modify the kernel module short, as it spells out a better alternative: NVM (Non-Volatile Memory).</p>
<p><span></span><span>The PHY has three LED outputs that can be configured via the NVM. The default values for the PHY (based on the LED NVM word 0x18 of the LAN region) are listed in the table below.</span><span></span></p>

<p>If you're wondering why the table mentions 3 LEDs when the LAN port only has 2: the second LED is bi-colored and can switch state to either green (LED2) or amber (LED1).</p>
<p>As a closing note on the kernel module: the code does not do what it appears to. Its only purpose is to provide an interface for blinking a single LED on request, in order to identify a NIC or LAN port. It's unrelated to LEDs blinking on network activity or otherwise, which is done in hardware.</p>
<h2>NVM</h2>
<p>Writeable flash memory, which holds configuration, like the MAC address or power management settings, detailed in the table below. The LED configuration is stored in the previously mentioned word <span>0x18</span>.</p>

<p>A minor detour first to explain the term <i>word</i>. It refers to a 2-byte (16-bit) value in little-endian order, meaning in reverse byte order. So value <span>0x1c10</span> is written <span>0x101c</span> to NVM. Very simple to do manually, by just swapping bytes, but can be done programmatically too. (These will be useful later.)</p>
<p>
def swap(value):
    return hex(value &gt;&gt; 8 | (value &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8)

&gt;&gt;&gt; swap(0x1c10)
'0x101c'</p>
<p>
function swap(value) {
    return '0x' + ((value &gt;&gt; 8 | (value &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8)).toString(16);
};

&gt; swap(0x1c10)
"0x101c"</p>
<p>Word <span>0x18</span> is encoded as follows.</p>

<p>It's a bit sequence with 5 bits each per LED. The first 3 bits on each LED set the mode, detailed in the second table. The remaining 2 bits invert and blink the LED. Below is a visual explanation on how to read this, using the default values.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/f418.x1.png?201706071858" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/f418.x2.png?201706071858 2x"></p><p>Such a sequence can be used directly with the <span>swap</span> function defined earlier, with <span>0b</span> prefix to indicate bits.</p>
<p>&gt; swap(0b0001100011110100)
"0xf418"</p>
<p>Now to construct a bit sequence to turn LEDs off permanently. As you notice, there is no mode to just flat disable an LED. It's still possible to get effectively the same result. There are two solutions.</p>
<p><span>1</span><span>Set the mode of each LED to <span>010</span>, so LEDs are on on any connection, and set the invert bit on each LED. Ergo, LEDs are off on any connection. With a minor side effect: in case of no connection, LEDs are on. (When the network cable is pulled, or when the opposite side is off.)</span></p>

</picture>
<p>&gt; swap(0b0010100101001010)
"0x4a29"</p>
<p><span>2</span><span>Set the mode of each LED to <span>101</span>, so LEDs are on <b>only</b> on a 10Mbps connection. Ergo, LEDs are off for either a 100Mbps or 1Gbps connection. Without side effect, as LEDs stay off in case of no connection.</span></p>

<source type="image/webp" media="(min-resolution:2dppx)" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/a514.x2.webp?201707100333 2x">

</picture>
<p>&gt; swap(0b0001010010100101)
"0xa514"</p>
<p>There are two additional variants to the second solution, which exclude the other link speed combinations each. I'll leave constructing the bit sequence for both as an exercise to the reader. Of both solutions I prefer the second due to lack of side effect when a link speed can be excluded. Usually either 10Mbps or 1Gbps definitely can be. A way to get the negotiated link speed is to use <i>dmesg</i>.</p>
<p>$ dmesg -t | grep e1000e
...
e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: Rx/Tx</p>
<p>So <span>0xa514</span> it is. Ready to write to NVM. The datasheet tells how.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Intel has an MS-DOS* software utility called EEupdate that is used to program the SPI Flash images in development or production line environments. A copy of this program can be obtained through your Intel Field Service representative.</span><span></span></p>
<p>That's no good. <i>EEupdate</i> is not publicly available. A bit of research reveals another Intel tool named <i>LANConf</i>, available for DOS, Linux, and Windows, which can also write to NVM, but can only be obtained by applying for a <a href="https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/my-intel/design-center-privileged-access-required.html">privileged account</a> and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Fortunately, <i><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/">ethtool</a></i> can handle NVM too.</p>
<p>To read from NVM, use as follows. (EEPROM and NVM are used interchangeably from here on.)</p>
<p>% ethtool -e|--eeprom-dump devname [raw on|off] [offset N] [length N]</p>
<p>As per the NVM Address Map, word <span>0x18</span> is at NVM byte offset <span>0x30</span>.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -e eth0 offset 0x30 length 2
Offset      Values
------      ------
0x0030:     f4 18</p>
<p>It matches the default value constructed earlier. Now to the important part: writing to NVM.</p>
<p>% ethtool -E|--change-eeprom devname [magic N] [offset N] [length N] [value N]</p>
<p>So <i>offset</i>, <i>length</i>, and <i>value</i> are obvious, but what does <i>magic</i> refer to? The manual knows.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Because of the persistent nature of writing to the EEPROM, a device-specific magic key must be specified to prevent the accidental writing to the EEPROM.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Where the device-specific magic key can be obtained from isn't documented anywhere. It appears to be kept somewhat secret on purpose. Only the file <i>ethtool.c</i> in the kernel module source code explains it.</p>
<p>eeprom-&gt;magic = adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;vendor | (adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;device &lt;&lt; 16);</p>
<p>Here <i>vendor</i> and <i>device</i> refer to <a href="https://pcisig.com/membership">PCI IDs</a>. There are numerous ways to get them, with the easiest perhaps being <i>lspci</i>.</p>
<p>$ lspci -nnq | grep Ethernet
00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I218-V [<b>8086</b>:<b>1559</b>] (rev 04)</p>
<p>The bold numbers are the <i>vendor</i> and <i>device</i> ID respectively, in hex. So this should give the magic key.</p>
<p>
&gt; '0x' + (0x8086 | (0x1559 &lt;&lt; 16)).toString(16)
"0x15598086"</p>
<p>Very simple. Alright, commence writing.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 length 2 value 0xa514
ethtool: bad command line argument(s)</p>
<p>The value of <i>value</i> can only be a single byte. The <i>length</i> parameter repeats that byte. (This isn't documented.) Both bytes must hence be written separately. </p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 value 0xa5
Cannot set EEPROM data: Invalid argument</p>
<p>This rather non-descriptive error took me quite a while to figure out. The <i>e1000e</i> kernel module included with the default kernel of Ubuntu 14.04.2 does not support writing to NVM, in this case at least. Intel has <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/network-and-i-o/ethernet-products/000005480.html">instructions</a> for compiling and installing the latest kernel module from source. Now it should work.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 value 0xa5
$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x31 value 0x14</p>
<p>And it does. Note: the LEDs remain unchanged until either the NUC is reset or the kernel module is reloaded.</p>
<h2>Windows / Mac</h2>
<p>I have not verified, but modifying NVM should also work for other OSes, unless the …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantization refers to techniques for performing computations and storing tensors at lower bitwidths than floating point precision. A quantized model executes some or all of the operations on tensors with integers rather than floating point values. This allows for a more compact model representation and the use of high performance vectorized operations on many hardware platforms. This technique is in particular useful at the inference time since it saves a lot of inference computation cost without sacrificing too much inference accuracies.</p>



<p>So far, major deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, have supported quantization natively. The users have been using the built-in quantization modules successfully without knowing how it works exactly. In this article, I would like to elucidate the mathematics of quantization for neural networks so that the developers would have some ideas about the quantization mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>

<h4 id="quantization-mapping">Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>Quantization maps a floating point value $x \in [\alpha, \beta]$ to a $b$-bit integer $x_q \in [\alpha_q, \beta_q]$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = c (x_q + d)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} x - d\big)\]

</p><p>where $c$ and $d$ are variables.</p>



<p>In order to derive $c$ and $d$, we have to make sure that $\alpha$ maps to $\alpha_q$ and $\beta$ maps to $\beta_q$. So we would just have to solve the linear system</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\beta &amp;= c (\beta_q + d) \\
\alpha &amp;= c (\alpha_q + d) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The solutions is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
c &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
d &amp;= \frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In practice, we would have to ensure that $0$ in floating point is represented exactly with no error after quantization.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we need to ensure</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x_q &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} 0 - d\big) \\
&amp;= \text{round}(- d) \\
&amp;= - \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= - d \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
d &amp;= \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By convention, we denote $c$ as the scale $s$ and $-d$ as the zero point $z$.</p>



<p>To summarize, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big)\]

</p><p>The value of scale $s$ and zero point $z$ are</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
z &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $z$ is an integer and $s$ is a <em>positive</em> floating point number.</p>

<h4 id="value-clipping">Value Clipping</h4>

<p>In practice, the quantization process will have chance to have $x$ that is outside the range of $[\alpha, \beta]$, thus the quantized value $x_q$ will also be outside the range of $[\alpha_q, \beta_q]$. If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1}-1)$, or unsigned <code>UINTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (0, 2^{b}-1)$, programming languages that have fixed type-precisions will clip the values that are outside the range.</p>



<p>More concretely, the quantization process will have an additional clip step.</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>where $\text{clip}(x, l, u)$ function is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{clip}(x, l, u) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      l &amp; \text{if $x &lt; l$}\\
      x &amp; \text{if $l \leq x \leq u$}\\
      u &amp; \text{if $x &gt; u$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="affine-quantization-mapping">Affine Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>The quantization mapping we discussed above is also called affine quantization mapping.</p>

<h4 id="scale-quantization-mapping">Scale Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code>, $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1} + 1, 2^{b-1}-1)$ and we force $z = 0$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{gather}
\alpha_q = -\beta_q \\
\text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) = 0 \\
\end{gather}\]

</p><p>This results in $\alpha = -\beta$. Therefore, we are mapping between the floating point range $[\alpha, -\alpha]$ and the integer range $[\alpha_q, -\alpha_q]$. Because it is exactly symmetric around $0$, we also call it symmetric quantization mapping.</p>



<p>Note that scale quantization mapping is just a special case of the affine quantization mapping, and we have an unused bit in the integer range.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_q(x, s, z) = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>and the de-quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_d(x_q, s, z) = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><h3 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication">Quantized Matrix Multiplication</h3>

<h4 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication-mathematics">Quantized Matrix Multiplication Mathematics</h4>

<p>Suppose we have to perform the matrix multiplication $Y = XW + b$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$, $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ resulting in $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} = b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would need to do $p$ floating number multiplications and $p$ floating number additions to compute one single entry in $Y$. To complete the full matrix multiplication, given there are $mn$ entries in $Y$, we would need to do $mpn$ floating number multiplications and $mpn$ floating number additions.</p>



<p>Depending on the floating number precision, such the speed of such floating point matrix multiplication might not be favored. So the question becomes can we complete the same matrix multiplication using quantized values.</p>



<p>Here we apply the de-quantization equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} &amp;= b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j} \\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \sum_{k=1}^{p} s_X(X_{q,i,k} - z_X) s_W(W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} (X_{q,i,k} - z_X) (W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\\
&amp;= s_Y(Y_{q,i,j} - z_Y)\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $X_q$, $W_q$, $b_q$ and $Y_q$ are the quantized matrix for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_b$, and $s_Y$ are the scales for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, and $z_X$, $z_W$, $z_b$ and $z_Y$ are the zero points for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[Y_{q,i,j} = z_Y + \frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \frac{s_X s_W}{s_Y} \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\]

</p><p>Note that in the above equation the following terms are constants during inference and therefore could be computed offline before inference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$z_Y$</li>
  <li>$\frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b)$</li>
  <li>$z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j}$</li>
  <li>$p z_X z_W$</li>
</ul>

<p>Term $\sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j}$ suggests that we could just do the integer matrix multiplication for $X_q$ and $W_q$. Such integer matrix multiplication could employ special hardware and algorithms, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-tuning-guide/index.html#tensor-operations">Tensor Core IMMA operations</a>, and runs much faster than conventional integer matrix multiplication.</p>

    <figcaption>NVIDIA Tensor Core Operations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>One additional thing to note is that $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_Y$, $z_X$, $z_W$, and $z_Y$ are floating point and integer constants, instead of variables. So there could be some special compile-time optimizations for those multiplications.</p>



<p>This could be retrieved from the resulting integer matrix from $X_q$ and $W_q$ multiplication, which is much faster than the floating number matrix multiplication for the same sizes.</p>



<p>The significance of such quantized matrix multiplication is that the product integer matrix could be converted back to floating point matrix using the scale and the zero point of the product integer matrix and it is almost numerically equivalent. If we have to do a sequence of matrix multiplications whose inputs and outputs are floating point numbers, for example</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_1 &amp;= X_0 W_0 + b_0\\
X_2 &amp;= X_1 W_1 + b_1\\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_n &amp;= X_n W_n + b_n\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could convert the math to the followings using quantized matrices.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_{0, q} &amp;= f_q(X_0, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0})\\
X_{1, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{0, q}, W_{0, q}, b_{0, q}, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0}, s_{W_0}, z_{W_0}, s_{b_0}, z_{b_0}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}) \\
X_{2, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{1, q}, W_{1, q}, b_{1, q}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}, s_{W_1}, z_{W_1}, s_{b_1}, z_{b_1}, s_{X_2}, z_{X_2}) \\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_{n, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{n-1, q}, W_{n-1, q}, b_{n-1, q}, s_{X_{n-1}}, z_{X_{n-1}}, s_{W_{n-1}}, z_{W_{n-1}}, s_{b_{n-1}}, z_{b_{n-1}}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n}) \\
X_n &amp;= f_d(X_{n, q}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n})
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $f_q$ is the quantization function, $f_m$ is the quantized matrix multiplication function, and $f_d$ is the de-quantization function.</p>

<p>In the following example, we simulated the quantization matrix multiplication of $Y = XW + b$ using random matrix $X$, $W$ and $b$.</p>

    <span><i>suckless, anticapitalist, public domain game for everyone</i></span>

    <span>THIS IS SPECIAL</span>

    <ul>
      <li>needs only <b>200 KB</b>, <b>32 KB RAM</b>, <b>40 MHz CPU</b>!</li>
      <li><b>suckless</b>, pure C, <b>no dependencies</b>, no FPU, GPU or file I/O needed</li>
      <li>10 levels, 6 weapons, 7 enemy types, 3 ammo types</li>
      <li>varying floor/ceiling oldschool SW ray casting engine with mouse support</li>
      <li><b>100% public domain</b> CC0 free software and culture</li>
      <li>100% original work, no third party assets</li>
      <li>well documented, hackable, <b>extremely portable</b></li>
      <li>completely <b>gratis</b>, without ads, DRM or similar bullshit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This isn't a 90s style retro shooter, this <b>is</b> a 90s shooter.
    </p>

    <p>
      This game runs everywhere and adheres to great <a href="https://suckless.org/">simplicity</a>.
      It is much more efficient and portable than Doom and has completely
      <b>no dependencies</b>. Not even floating point is used, in case your
      computer doesn't have the HW unit. The game can fit into <b>200 KB</b>
      (including assets!) and can run with just <b>32 KB RAM</b>. No build system,
      library, internet connection or package manager is inherently required for
      compilation as the whole game is written in pure C language.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an experiment and art that categorically rejects capitalist
      technology.

    <span>MORE THAN A GAME</span>

    <p>
      This is not a mere entertainment or toy meant for killing time or pursuing
      low goals such as making profit or something to put on portfolio, this is
      much more. Anarch is completely <b>gratis and free as in freedom</b> and
      besides entertainment can also be used for education, research, hacking, media
      creation, as a benchmark, as a test, as an environment, as an engine, as
      a basis for something greater. You are not limited by anything, there are
      no conditions to agree to. Nothing is hidden, everything is allowed, no
      burdens are imposed. The best motivation for creating anything is only
      the <b>pure love of creation for its own sake</b>, unburdened by any other
      goal than creating something truly useful. 
    </p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Anarch_Devices.jpg" alt="screenshots">

    <span>NO ONE OWNS THIS</span>

    <p>
      Not even I, the creator, own any part of this game.
      I&nbsp;have purposefully created everything myself from scratch,
      including the engine, graphics, sounds, music, even the font and palette,
      so that I could eventually give up all my rights and
      dedicate this game fully and <b>completely to the public domain</b>,
      to you, my dear fellow human being. No one should be allowed to own
      information and art.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've done my best to ensure this is 100% free as in freedom software and
      culture, well understandable and documented. This isn't made for any
      profit. This is made out of <b>love</b>, for you and for the greater good.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article marks the first of 5 articles covering the virtualization of the <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management-unit-MMU"><strong>memory management unit</strong></a> (MMU) using Intel EPT. This technology is used as additional support for the virtualization of physical memory and allows hypervisors to monitor memory activity. In this article, we’ll address the motivation for extended page tables, the many performance concerns associated, and the different architectural components associated with <a href="https://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu%2F~nhonarmand%2Fcourses%2Fsp17%2Fcse506%2Fslides%2fmmu_virtualization.pdf"><strong>MMU virtualization</strong></a>. The components will be covered in some detail, but the majority of information about the various components will be found in the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-combined-volumes-1-2a-2b-2c-2d-3a-3b-3c-3d-and-4.html"><strong>Intel SDM</strong></a>. We will not be discussing anything OS-specific in this article – just the architectural details necessary to understand for proper implementation.</p>
<div>
<p><i> </i> <strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>It’s important that readers should have a foundational knowledge of virtual memory, paging, address translation, and page tables. This can be found in <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html"><strong><span><span>§</span></span>4.1.0 V-3A Intel SDM</strong></a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Memory and the MMU</h2>
<p>In this rundown, we’re going to cover some important concepts as they related to the memory management unit and paging. This is by no means a full discourse on paging and virtual memory for the Intel architecture, but more of an abstract overview to help you connect the dots a little better.</p>
<h4>— Physical and Virtual Memory</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Operating_System_Design/Physical_Memory"><strong>Physical memory</strong></a> exists on physical cards like DIMM modules and storage devices like hard-disks. If you’re familiar with fundamental concepts in computer science then you may recall that before any process can be executed it must be mapped into physical memory. Now, on modern systems, there is a secondary memory storage space called <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Operating_System_Design/Virtual"><strong>virtual memory</strong></a>. In a perfect world, data required to run programs would be mapped directly into RAM where it can be accessed quickly by the processor. Sadly, we don’t live in a perfect world, and the system’s main memory can become full. Enter stage right, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Operating_System_Design/Virtual"><strong>virtual memory</strong></a>. The secondary form of memory utilizes a storage device like a hard drive to free up space in physical memory. But, we’re not concerned with virtual memory for the time being. When setting up EPT we need to know some important details about physical memory, first and foremost.</p>
<p>When a computer begins its boot sequence the code executing on the bootstrapping processor is able to access physical memory directly. This is because the processor is operating in what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode"><strong>real address mode</strong></a> which was aptly named since addresses in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode"><strong>real-mode</strong></a> correspond to their physical memory addresses. There is also a number of physical memory ranges available for use by the OS/bootloader, at this point. If we were to breakpoint a system and dump the physical memory ranges present we’d be able to see what’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_map"><strong>system memory map</strong></a>. I did just that and wanted to explain some of the different things that are relevant to this series. Below is an image of the physical memory ranges when my breakpoint prior to <code>MmInitSystem</code> was hit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windbg_8aRBTuXRKa.png?resize=346%2C164&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="346" height="164" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windbg_8aRBTuXRKa.png?w=346&amp;ssl=1 346w, https://i0.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windbg_8aRBTuXRKa.png?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The image shows the physical memory ranges and their size. The first range from <code>1000h-A0000h</code> is available as general DRAM for OS consumption. This range of memory is also called low-memory – sometimes DOS compatibility memory. So, what’s the purpose of this drivel? Well, during the boot sequence the BIOS does a number of things, but the most relevant thing to this series is applying the different caching behaviors to physical memory ranges. The BIOS programs something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_type_range_register"><strong>memory-type range register</strong></a> (MTRR) to achieve this. These are a set of control registers that give the system control over how specific memory ranges are cached. The details of the caching requirements vary from system to system. For the sake of example, the physical memory range <code>1000h-9FFFFh</code> is typically programmed to be <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-through-and-write-back-in-cache/"><strong>write-back</strong></a>. Whereas the range <code>A0000h-BFFFFh</code> is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_combining">write-combined</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/microsoft.public.windowsce.embedded/lYFGz_8C3xg/_wVbles8tWEJ">uncached</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how MTRRs are relevant, don’t worry. We’ll get to that…</p>
<h4><strong><span><span><b>𝛿</b></span></span></strong> Memory Type Range Register (MTRR)</h4>
<p>So, physical memory is divided into ranges and each range has its own cache-control policy applied during system initialization. Why is this important? For starters, applying the proper caching policies to memory regions is vital to ensure that system performance doesn’t go down the toilet. If a frequently accessed region of memory is set to be <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/microsoft.public.windowsce.embedded/lYFGz_8C3xg/_wVbles8tWEJ"><strong>uncached</strong></a> then frequent data fetches will degrade system performance significantly. This would happen because applications typically access data with high measures of locality. If data isn’t present in a cache then the CPU will have to reach out to main memory to acquire it – reaching out to main memory is slow! This is important because when allocating memory and initializing <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/2480/10"><strong>EPT</strong></a> we’ll have to build what’s called an <strong><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/mtrr.html">MTRR map</a></strong>. Fortunately for us, there is already an <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/mtrr.html"><strong>MTRR map</strong></a> of the current physical memory regions that we can use as a reference.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windbg_Sgn3QpgXBY.png?resize=518%2C302&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="518" height="302" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windbg_Sgn3QpgXBY.png?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https://i1.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windbg_Sgn3QpgXBY.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><span>Figure 1. MTRR map on physical machine.</span></p>
<p>From the image, you might notice the ranges are quite specific – this is due to Windows using <strong><a href="https://xem.github.io/minix86/manual/intel-x86-and-64-manual-vol3/o_fe12b1e2a880e0ce-435.html">fixed-range MTRRs</a></strong> and some <strong><a href="https://xem.github.io/minix86/manual/intel-x86-and-64-manual-vol3/o_fe12b1e2a880e0ce-434.html">variable-range MTRRs</a></strong>. Armed with this information, it’s clear that applying the appropriate caching policy to our extended page tables during initialization is imperative to preserving system performance. No need to worry either, modifying and creating an <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/MTRR_and_PAT"><strong>MTRR map</strong></a> for our VM is straightforward. We’ll go into more detail in the next article when we build our <strong><a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/jdm4372/tag/mtrr/">MTRR map</a></strong>. See the recommended reading if you’re eager to get ahead. With this addressed, let’s talk about the purpose of the MMU and page tables.</p>
<div>
<p><i> </i> <strong>Page Attribute Table</strong></p>
<p>In addition to MTRRs, there is an additional cache-control called the <strong>Page Attribute Table</strong> (PAT) that is primarily used by the OS to control caching policies at a finer granularity (page level). This cache control is detailed more in the next article.</p>
</div>
<h4>— The MMU</h4>
<p>Most modern processors come with a <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management-unit-MMU"><strong>memory management unit</strong></a> (MMU) implemented which provides access protection and virtual-to-physical address translation. A virtual address is, simply put, an address that software uses; a physical address is an address that hardware outputs on the address lines of the data bus. Intel architectures divide virtual memory into 4KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)"><strong>pages</strong></a> (with support for other sizes) and physical memory into 4KB <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/11667/what-is-the-difference-between-a-page-of-memory-and-a-frame-of-memory"><strong>frames</strong></a>. An MMU will typically contain a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/translation-lookaside-buffer"><strong>translation lookaside buffer</strong></a> (TLB) and will perform operations on the page table such as hardware table walks. Some MMU architectures won’t perform those operations. This is done to give the OS the freedom to implement its page table in whatever manner it desires. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit"><strong>MMU architecture</strong></a> specifies certain caching policies for the instruction and data cache whether identifying code as cacheable or non-cacheable, or write-back and write-through data caching. These policies may also cover caching access rights.</p>
<div>
<p><i> </i> <strong>MMU Split</strong></p>
<p>In certain processors, the MMU can be split into an <strong>Instruction Memory Management Unit</strong> (IMMU) and <strong>Data Memory Management Unit</strong> (DMMU). The first is activated with instruction fetches and the latter with memory operations.</p>
</div>
<p>The MMU architecture for the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/microarchitecture/intel-64-architecture-general.html"><strong>Intel64 architecture</strong></a> provides a physical address space that covers <span><span>16-EiB</span></span>. However, only 2^57 units are addressable in current architectures with the new page table structure. That’s still ~128-PiB of address space available. The short and “simple” for how an MMU works is this – the MMU gets a virtual address and uses it to index into a table (TLB or page tables.) These entries in the table provide a physical address plus some control signals that may include the caching policy, whether the entry is valid, invalid, protected, and so on. It may also receive signals as to whether the memory referenced by the entry was accessed/modified. If the entry is valid then the virtual address is translated into the physical address; the MMU will then use information from the control signals to determine what type of memory transaction is occurring. These tables mentioned are similar to a directory structure. The MMU will traverse the page tables to translate the virtual address to the physical address. Now on x86-64 architecture, the MMU maps memory through a series of tables – 4 or 5 depending on software requirements.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/address_translation.png?resize=511%2C294&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="511" height="294" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/address_translation.png?w=511&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i2.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/address_translation.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><span>Figure 1. Simplified diagram of address translation.</span></p>

<p>We’ll cover a bit about TLBs and their role in a virtualization context later. Since we know the purpose of the MMU now let’s talk start talking about Intel’s EPT.</p>
<h2>Extended Page Tables (EPT)</h2>
<p>Intel’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation"><strong>Extended Page Table</strong></a> (EPT) technology, also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation"><strong>Secondary Level Address Translation</strong></a> (SLAT), allows a VMM to configure a mapping between the physical memory as it is perceived by the guest and the real physical memory. It’s similar to the virtual page table in that EPT enables the hypervisor to specify <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/page-table-entry"><strong>access rights</strong></a> for a guest’s physical pages. This allows the hypervisor to generate an event called an EPT violation when a guest attempts to access a page that is either invalid or doesn’t have appropriate access rights. This <a href="https://xem.github.io/minix86/manual/intel-x86-and-64-manual-vol3/o_fe12b1e2a880e0ce-1127.html"><strong>EPT violation</strong></a> is one of the events we’ll be taking advantage of throughout this series since it triggers a VM-exit.</p>
<div>
<p><i> </i> <strong>Important Note</strong></p>
<p>Virtualization of the IOMMU is performed by a complementary technology to EPT called VT-d. This won’t be covered in this series.</p>
</div>
<p>This technology is extraordinarily useful. For instance, one can utilize EPT to protect the hypervisor’s code and data from malicious code attempting to modify it. This would be done by setting the access rights to the VMM’s code and data to read-only. In addition to that, if a VMM were to be used to whitelist certain applications it could modify the access rights of the remaining physical address space to write-only. This would force a VM-exit on any execution to allow the hypervisor to validate the faulting page. Just a fun thought experiment.</p>
<p>Enough about the potential, let’s get into the motivations for EPT and address the other various components associated…</p>

  <a href="http://alltom.com/">← <span>alltom.com</span></a>
</header>







<p>I haven't written straight JavaScript in years. I use <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> for everything, including DOM manipulation, integrating with audio libraries and TensorFlow models, and using graphics libraries like <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.

</p><p>This page explains how.

</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Go for web programming</h2>

<p>The good: Go is a great glue language, and most web programming is gluing things together. Even though Go doesn't have a complicated type system, most code I write works the first time. Go compiles to every architecture and platform that I've ever cared about, including web browsers, so I can usually reuse my packages regardless of where the code runs.

</p><p>On the other hand, the syscall/js syntax is annoyingly verbose, particularly when it comes to callbacks, and particularly when those callbacks are used with Promises. I mitigate these issues by isolating usage of syscall/js in shared packages, <a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps#abstract_the_dependency">as you might for any other dependency</a>.

</p><p>The <em>motivation</em> for me to write this article is that I feel very productive writing web sites with Go and I want to share that secret superpower with you. However, the <em>point</em> of writing this article is to make writing Go on the web easy by showing you the hard parts up front. Since I try to illustrate every roadblock with as little code as possible, it might look like Go web development is all roadblocks, but that's not true. Please don't be discouraged! It gets easier as your code base scales.

</p><h2>Scaffolding</h2>



<p>There's one entry point for the server, and one for the code that runs in the browser. It just takes these four files to get off the ground:

</p><ul>
<li>project/server/main.go
</li><li>project/server/public/index.html
</li><li>project/browser/main.go
</li><li>project/browser/generate.go (only needed for convenience)
</li></ul>

<p>Inititalize the project by running <tt>go mod init yourproject</tt> in the project/ directory. <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">This is good Go hygeine these days</a>; it creates a file in your project directory that tracks version numbers and hashes of all your dependencies.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/server/main.go</h3>



<p>Until you add more server-side features, project/server/main.go just serves the static files in the public/ directory:

</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"flag"
	"net/http"
)

var httpAddress = flag.String("http_address", "localhost:8080", "Address for serving HTTP")

func main() {
	http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("public")))
	http.ListenAndServe(*httpAddress, nil)
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>project/server/public/index.html</h3>



<p>index.html just needs to invoke the compiled Go code:

</p><pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;yourproject&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;script src="wasm_exec.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
if (!WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming) {
	// Polyfill, required for Safari.
	WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming = async (resp, importObject) =&gt; {
		const source = await (await resp).arrayBuffer();
		return await WebAssembly.instantiate(source, importObject);
	};
}

const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject).then((result) =&gt; {
	go.run(result.instance);
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The section below about generate.go explains where wasm_exec.js and main.wasm come from.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/browser/main.go</h3>

<p>This is the entry-point for the Go code that runs in the browser, including some examples of how to access global JavaScript objects (which is the same for <tt>document.body</tt> and the rest of the DOM):

</p><pre><code>// +build js,wasm

package main

import (
	"syscall/js"
)

func main() {
	js.Global().Get("console").Call("log", "Hello, World!")

	var cb js.Func
	cb = js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		js.Global().Call("alert", "Hello, World!")
		cb.Release()
		return nil
	})
	js.Global().Call("setTimeout", cb, 2000)

	&lt;-(make(chan bool))
}</code></pre>

<p>I told you the syscall/js syntax was awful.

</p><p>I end with <tt>&lt;-(make(chan bool))</tt> because otherwise, the Go program exits, and any DOM callbacks you've registered (click handlers, timers, etc) that call into Go code will fail.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/browser/generate.go</h3>

<p>index.html refers to two files that you don't write by hand: wasm_exec.js ships with Go, and main.wasm is compiled from project/browser/main.go.

</p>

<p>I put <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate">go:generate</a> directives in generate.go, which allows you to run <tt>go generate</tt> to put both files into the public/ directory:

</p><pre><code>package main

//go:generate cp $GOROOT/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js ../server/public/
//go:generate env GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../server/public/main.wasm</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Start the server in one terminal:

</p><pre><code>$ cd project/server/
$ go run main.go</code></pre>



<p>Re-compile the code that runs in the browser whenever you make a change:

</p><pre><code>$ cd project/browser/
$ go generate</code></pre>

<p>View your new, fancy web site by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a>

</p><h2>Miscellaneous notes</h2>

<h3><tt>foo == null</tt></h3>

<p>When I wrote JavaScript, I avoided having to care about the difference between JavaScript's <tt>null</tt> and <tt>undefined</tt> by always coercing them to the same value with <tt>==</tt>. For example, <tt>foo == null</tt> is true regardless of whether foo is <tt>null</tt> or <tt>undefined</tt>.

</p><p>That option isn't available with Go's <tt>js.Null()</tt> and <tt>js.Undefined()</tt>, so be prepared to care about the difference, or write a helper.

</p><h3>Promises and async functions</h3>

<p>As you saw above, Go functions that are used as JavaScript callbacks are not automatically garbage-collected and have elaborate syntax. That makes Promises and <tt>async</tt> functions hard to deal with.

</p>

<p>So I use this helper to convert Promises to idiomatic Go return values:

</p><pre><code>func UnwrapPromise(promise js.Value) (js.Value, error) {
	retc := make(chan js.Value)
	errc := make(chan error)

	var release func()
	success := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		retc &lt;- args[0]
		release()
		return nil
	})
	failure := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		errc &lt;- fmt.Errorf("%v", args[0])
		release()
		return nil
	})
	release = func() {
		success.Release()
		failure.Release()
	}

	promise.Call("then", success).Call("catch", failure)
	select {
	case ret := &lt;-retc:
		return ret, nil
	case err := &lt;-errc:
		return js.Undefined(), err
	}
}</code></pre>

        <tbody><tr>
          <td>
      
            <a name="FAQs"></a>
            <h2><strong>
              FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions
              </strong></h2>
            
            <p><strong>
              What are the requirements?</strong><br>
              Sudden View runs under any 32-bit Windows environment with a minimum of VGA
              display. This includes Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>
              Why so retro?</strong><br>
              Sudden View's not retro, it's archaic. If it looks like something from out of the 80s,
              that's because it is. I began coding Sudden View in 1989 and began using it
              in 1990. It's first commercial release was in 1992 and it hasn't
              changed much since then. I did the Windows port in 1996 and added the
              ViewBar in 1999. It's been in limited or general release since 1990.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>
              Does the world really need yet another text editor?</strong><br>
              I think so, mostly because Sudden View is NOT just another text editor.
              As a frustrated writer (one who hasn't been published), I've
              continued to review editing tools over the years. Since I've never
              found anything that allows me to manipulate text as quickly and
              effectively as Sudden View I've continued to use it personally. Plus
              friends and colleagues continue to ask for downloads. I figured since
              I've done the work I might as well make it available to the public.
              YOU decide if it's really needed or not.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>
              Why the funky font?</strong><br>
              In order to visually manipulate vertical text blocks a mono-spaced font is required.
              Besides, Sudden View is about content, not presentation. The focus is steak over sizzle.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>
              How do you print from Sudden View?</strong><br>
              You don't. Consider it my contribution to the paperless office.  See the manual
              for more detail (this may change soon).
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>
              Why doesn't Sudden View work like other Windows editors?</strong><br>
              Because if it did, it would be just another Windows editor. Sudden View is a
              way to explore an alternative approach to editing text.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>
              Is Sudden View free?</strong><br>
              Well, yes, sort of.  Though technically not a free text editor,
              Sudden View is unlimited shareware. It can evaluated indefinitely
              and is not limited in time or features, but it DOES ask you to
              register every now and then.
            </p>

										Startups: The Very Beginning									</a>
									 &nbsp;by Jessica Livingston									<br>
								</h5>
								
								<p>
									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<p><span>Founders and co-founders alike are the foundation of any startup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“You can always change the idea you are working on, but it’s much harder to get rid of a cofounder. So you want to choose cofounders very carefully.” — Jessica Livingston</span></p>
<p><span>This person should be someone you know. You’ve already worked with this person. You know they are effective, reliable, and share similar ambitions/moral outlooks as you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jessica suggests that these 3 qualities should make up the founding team as a whole:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><i>Determination</i></b><span>: “Startups are really hard and take a really long time. There has to be at least one founder who’s just a tower of strength. Part of being determined is being able to withstand rejection. People will think your idea is lame, customers won’t be interested, investors will say no, reporters won’t care. And they might not be polite about it either. But you can’t let rejection discourage you.” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
<li><b><i>Domain expertise</i></b><span>: “At least one of the founders should be an expert in what you’re working on” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
<li><b><i>Ability/willingness to sell</i></b><span>: “Someone has to be the face of the company—to sell the product to customers, and sell the company itself to investors, the press, and potential hires. At least one of you is going to have to sell.” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you know you want to start a startup one day, but you’re not ready now, start working on smaller projects with friends or potential future co-founders. You’ll be able to filter out who fits the criteria above vs. who doesn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“A good way to ensure that you make something people want is to make something you yourself want. But remember that making something for yourself is just a heuristic to guide you in finding an idea. In the actual execution, you need to focus on users. You need to understand what they want, and be fanatically dedicated to making them happy. One very important piece of advice we give startups is to ‘do things that don’t scale.’ That means to do so much for your early users that you couldn’t possibly keep doing that much if you were bigger.” — Jessica Livingston</span></p>
<p><span>All in all, Jessica finishes with “if you can make something people want, if you can focus on delighting users, and you measure how much you delight them in revenue, then you can start a startup. That’s the standard to hold yourself to, not the stock character founder you see in the press.”</span></p>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: A thing that I’ve somewhat figured out is that there’s no secret playbook for building a company. There are obviously certain things you need to know (that I’m still figuring out), but it seems to essentially boil down to Jessica’s final quote above. </span></p>

                                <p>Loblaw Companies Ltd. plans to roll out its first autonomous delivery service in January, as Canada's largest retailer explores new ways of shipping goods to customers amid a broad increase in online shopping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loblaw partnered with Palo Alto, Calif.-based software startup Gatik AI for the delivery service. Gatik, which also has offices in Toronto, was founded in 2017 and focuses on the "middle mile" of logistics where it hauls goods over short distances for retailers and distributors. The company raised $4.5 million in seed funding in 2018 and counts Walmart Inc. as a customer in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loblaw said the new service includes five Ford Transit 350 box trucks outfitted with Gatik's self-driving system, which will drive on five fixed routes across the Toronto area for seven days a week, 12 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicles will provide a contactless delivery solution for transporting goods from Loblawâ€™s automated picking facility to retail locations, the retailer said.</p>

<p>"As more Canadians are turning to online grocery shopping, we need to continue to identify new ways to make our supply chain more efficient," said Lauren Steinberg, senior vice president of Loblaw Digital, in a phone interview. "And 'middle mile' autonomous delivery is a great example of one way we think we can achieve that."</p>

<p>While the number of autonomous trucks remains small in the U.S. and Canada, they have the potential to radically disrupt how merchandise is moved. A 2018 report by McKinsey &amp; Co. found that if trucking companies shifted entirely to autonomous vehicles, it would help cut operating costs by 45 per cent, saving the industry as much as US$125 billion a year.</p>

<p>Loblaw said earlier this month its e-commerce sales climbed 175 per cent in the third quarter, driven by shoppers turning to online shopping to avoid physical bricks-and-mortar stores during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To abide by Canadian regulations, all of Loblaw's self-driving trucks will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. It marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in commercial operation in Canada, according to Gatik.</p>

<p>Steinberg said Loblaw began talks with Gatik for about a year before launching the service, which is expected to handle about 1,000 orders a day. The pilot program will operate for two years, after which Loblaw will determine whether it will expand the service.</p>

<p>"To move these orders autonomously helps us get them there faster, more frequently, and keep up with the increase in demand that we're seeing in the online grocery space generally," Steinberg said.</p>

<p>Oshoma Momoh, chief technical advisor at MaRS Discovery District, said that it should take another seven to 10 years for vehicles to operate fully autonomously and without the need for a safety pilot on Canadian roads. But until then, any driverless cars on the road will be able to collect valuable data on a variety of weather and traffic conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The way all of this works is that companies build up more common use cases or examples of how driving works in real life, and train their software to become more self-sufficient," Momoh said in a phone interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: A previous version of this story&nbsp;included incorrect information about when&nbsp;the service would begin. BNN Bloomberg regrets this error.&nbsp;</em></p>

Gur emailed a friend working at Oren’s Hummus, a popular Silicon Valley Mediterranean restaurant: “I met the Fluc team about potentially investing in their business. They mentioned to me that Oren's is a big restaurant for them, and that you know about the service. Have you spent much time with them?”</p><p><strong>Gur received a response that could have earned his firm billions of dollars. Sadly, that email only triggered a sequence of events that netted the firm a position worth hundreds of millions of dollars today.</strong></p><p>“Fluc is a company I have used at Oren's,” Oren’s Palo Alto general manager, Mistie Boulton Cohen, wrote in her email reply – an opening line so brutally matter of fact that anyone who has made a reference check should know what’s coming. (Fluc would eventually join a well-populated graveyard of failed food delivery startups.) </p><p>She directed Gur’s attention to another food delivery company. “My team loves DoorDash as do many of our customers,” she wrote. “Fluc definitely has better marketing material and technology but DoorDash builds a relationship rather [than] just another delivery company who picks up and delivers without much more than that.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0bcceee-0c1a-468f-b4e2-fa48dc025394_3300x2550.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0bcceee-0c1a-468f-b4e2-fa48dc025394_3300x2550.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a0bcceee-0c1a-468f-b4e2-fa48dc025394_3300x2550.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1125,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2377800,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;CRV's Saar Gur&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="CRV's Saar Gur"></a></figure></div><p>Gur, whose wife is a restaurateur, was a big believer that food delivery could work with the right team, so he tracked down the DoorDash founders, including now-CEO <strong>Tony Xu</strong>. DoorDash had recently finished Demo Day at Y Combinator. “Tony is just remarkable,” Gur recalls thinking. “We were finishing each other’s sentences.”</p><p>Gur proposed leading the company’s seed round. “My only mistake was I think I could probably have led the entire round,” Gur said. “There was the star power – Keith wants to participate. I introduced them to some angels – <strong>Semil Shah</strong>, a lot of people.” So, Gur’s venture capital firm, CRV, ended up sharing the round with Khosla Ventures, where <strong>Keith Rabois</strong> was a partner, and a number of angel investors. </p><p>“Initially I want to say I owned about 10% of the company,” Gur recalls. I think they then added a few more people into the note, so I think the final ownership may have been just under 10%.”</p><p>Notably, Sequoia Capital’s <strong>Alfred Lin</strong>, the former chief operating officer at pioneer ecommerce company Zappos, passed on the seed round after meeting with the team. Lin worried that the DoorDash model seemed to be predicated on college kids spending their parents’ money. (All four founders met at Stanford where the business started.) The next year, Lin led the $17.3 million Series A round and took a board seat. The round gave Sequoia about one-fifth of DoorDash’s shares.</p><p><strong>This is a story about how you get “Sequoia rich.” </strong>It’s a case study in why investing early isn’t enough. And it is proof that, even if you pick the right space and find the exact right company to bet on before anyone else, SoftBank can still end up owning more of the company than you. This is the story of DoorDash’s cap table. </p><p>As a general rule, after Sequoia invests, there are always plenty of eager followers. <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/03/17/exclusive-doordash-raises-new-vc-from-kleiner-perkins/">In March 2015</a>, <strong>John Doerr</strong> – as his venture firm Kleiner Perkins was defending itself in a reputationally scarring trial with his former chief of staff <strong>Ellen Pao</strong> – announced that he was leading DoorDash’s Series B round, giving the company a rich $595 million valuation. </p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-23/in-overcrowded-food-delivery-market-venture-capitalists-are-still-hungry-for-more?sref=WS92jZg5">Later that year,</a> DoorDash approached investors about a potential billion-dollar valuation. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation?sref=WS92jZg5">By December</a>, Uber was raising money at a $62.5 billion valuation. It was the year everyone’s expectations about what was possible with private unicorn valuations exploded. </p><p>But then investors suddenly cooled on food. Rival Postmates CEO <strong>Bastian Lehmann</strong>, who knows when to just state the obvious, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-31/postmates-secures-141-million-in-a-super-super-difficult-fundraising-effort?sref=WS92jZg5">told me in a 2016 interview</a> that their fundraising round was “super, super difficult.”</p><p>Similarly, DoorDash lowered its expectations. Sequoia agreed to invest again at a similar price to the Kleiner round. &nbsp;The infusion of capital gave DoorDash a lower share price and a higher post-money valuation. DoorDash <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-45160">raised</a> $127 million at a post-money valuation of roughly $700 million.</p><p>At the time, it looked like Sequoia was doubling down on a losing investment. In retrospect, it was a genius move. Sequoia had the advantage of being an early investor in Chinese delivery company Meituan. The firm’s partners knew that if someone could make the food delivery model work in the United States, there was a lot of money to be made, so it invested when everyone else was getting nervous. </p><p>The round certainly established that Sequoia is <em>not a cuddly investor</em>. Here you have the company’s main partner investing on the cheap when a young founder wants to solidify his unicorn status. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150aca19-3e96-4082-a51c-a2f777b6dfea_3000x2254.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F150aca19-3e96-4082-a51c-a2f777b6dfea_3000x2254.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/150aca19-3e96-4082-a51c-a2f777b6dfea_3000x2254.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1094,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:863808,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Of course, it would have been better for Sequoia if DoorDash didn’t need the money at all. And this is an essential point: these costly fundraising rounds dilute early investors and the company’s founders. By investing a bunch of money in DoorDash, Sequoia diluted its own early investment while buying that ownership percentage back with new money. That’s the reality of the food delivery business as we would soon see. </p><p>DoorDash, hungry for yet more money, went to the most logical place: the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund. DoorDash started negotiations with SoftBank’s <strong>Jeffrey Housenbold</strong> only to learn that SoftBank was going to make a massive, complicated investment in food delivery rival Uber. The Uber round closed and still DoorDash didn’t have a deal. DoorDash became more and more worried about its depleting bank account.</p><p>Finally, Housenbold convinced <strong>Masa </strong>that food wouldn’t be a winner-take-all market. And, in March 2018, SoftBank led a $535 million round that valued DoorDash at $1.4 billion. <strong>Xu got his unicorn status but at the cost of heavy dilution. </strong></p><p><strong>Jeremy Kranz</strong> at GIC and Sequoia participated in the mega round that would permanently alter the company’s ownership structure. The deal would help make SoftBank the biggest shareholder in DoorDash, even though Sequoia had invested in the company years earlier and participated in every round thereafter. GIC is now the third largest shareholder. </p><p>After that, the money started flowing in. DoorDash’s business model looked more secure and late stage investors piled in. DST and Coatue led a $250 million investment at $4 billion in 2018. The company was recently valued at $16 billion in a round led by Durable Capital Partners, which was joined by Fidelity and T. Rowe Price. DoorDash has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm">filed to go public</a> and is expected to begin trading by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>Today, Gur owns far less of the company than he once did. </strong>He estimates he has a 3% stake in DoorDash. Gur’s firm, CRV, invested about $10 million in the company altogether, exercising its pro rata rights as long as it could afford. </p><p>It should go without saying that Gur is ecstatic to own as much as he does in a company that he believes could be the next Amazon. And many early investors would prefer to be judged on their return on money invested, not ownership stake.</p><p>Today, Gur operates a larger fund so he could buy more shares of promising portfolio companies along the way. He said his firm is still the largest shareholder in buzzy cloud collaboration company Airtable thanks to this more aggressive strategy. </p><p>In the late 2010s, late stage firms were able to buy up a huge percentage of cash-intensive companies as early stage investors were ill-equipped to defend their positions. DoorDash raised more than $2 billion as a private company. “If we bought 10% and maintained our pro-rata...we would have invested $240 million in the company (almost the size of our fund),” Gur explained in an email. </p><p>Regarding Sequoia’s persistent investing, Gur says, “I'd love to know total dollars into the company – it's not an insignificant amount of capital. I just have so much respect for their conviction level.”</p><p>I got the answer. A source tells me that altogether<strong> Sequoia invested $217 million in DoorDash</strong>, exercising the firm’s pro rata rights along the way, leading the Series C, and joining those late stage rounds. Investing in the Series A set them on the path to amass an enormous stake in the company, but it wouldn’t have been enough. Khosla Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and other early funds are now minor investors with less than 5% stakes in the company.</p><p>Sequoia has a 15.3% stake in DoorDash, accounting for dilution. Even at just a $16 billion valuation, that stake is worth $2.4 billion.</p><p>Despite the hard work from Sequoia, SoftBank owns more – though it certainly paid more for its stake. SoftBank owns 18.6% of the company. </p><p>The dilutive fundraising rounds hurt DoorDash’s founders. Xu owns 4.4% of the company and his two remaining co-founders own 4% each. Compare that to Airbnb’s co-founders. CEO Brian Chesky owns about 12% of his company, while his two co-founders own 11% each. (<a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1329549772785659905">I tweeted out Airbnb’s cap table last night</a>.)</p><p>If you read through DoorDash’s IPO prospectus, CRV doesn’t even make the footnotes. Oren’s Hummus got a couple mentions though.</p><p>“Fighting for the underdog is part of who I am and what we stand for as a company,” Xu writes in his <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm">investor letter</a>. He recalls speaking to “countless merchants since DoorDash’s founding in 2013,” including, “a Mom and Pop store like Oren’s Hummus.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde269d9f-5b62-4f00-85e5-eee46eead3b9_698x515.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde269d9f-5b62-4f00-85e5-eee46eead3b9_698x515.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de269d9f-5b62-4f00-85e5-eee46eead3b9_698x515.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:515,&quot;width&quot;:698,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97828,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <span>Monday 23 Nov 2020, 18:30</span> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>RAM is most likely the scarcest resource that is first exhausted on your servers. If you’re serious about running software under Linux/Unix, you’re certainly aware of what an OOMKill is.</p> <p>Short refresher: when a program requests a new memory page from the kernel two things can happen.</p> <ul><li>There is a free memory page: The kernel page assigns the page to the process and everything is great.</li> <li>The system is Out Of Memory (OOM): The kernel chooses a process based on its ‘badness’ (mainly by how much ram it uses). It sends a SIGKILL to the process. This forces the receiving process to exit with exit code <code>137</code>. All the memory pages belonging to that process are free and now the kernel can fulfill the memory request.</li></ul> <p>Lately, I had a task to add alerting to a sizeable Kubernetes cluster. The cluster has ~100 active Deployments with autoscaling of nodes up to ~50 nodes at peak times. The cluster is well maintained and has a robust autoscaling strategy. All deployments have resource limits defined. Sometimes, some of the deployed pods would breach the memory limits. In those cases, it would be nice to find out when that happens and investigate the cause of it.</p> <p>Prometheus and Alertmanager were already deployed. So I’ve thought that alerting on OOMKills will be as easy. I just had to find the right metric(s) indicating that OOMKill has happened and write an alerting rule for it. Given the length of this post, you could imagine how wrong I was!</p> <h2>First Attempt</h2> <p>A brief Google search has led me to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/pod-metrics.md" rel="nofollow">kube pod state metric</a>. It turns out it has a metric called <code>kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason</code>. The value of the metric is <code>1</code> when a container in a pod has terminated with an error. Based on the exit code, the <code>reason</code> label will be set to <code>OOMKilled</code> if the exit code was <code>137</code>. That sounded promising! So I’ve created an alert for that.</p> <p>As usual, things are rarely straightforward. As soon as the container restarts, the value of this metric will be <code>1</code>. For alerting purposes, one has to combine it with another metric that will change when a pod restarts. <code>kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total</code> does that. Combine the two - and Bingo! It Worked!</p> <h2>“Invisible” OOMKills</h2> <p>For a brief moment, I’ve thought that I was done. I was about to declare victory over OOMKills in production! But then a puzzle came my way: One of our software developers has come forward. He claimed that one of his pods was running out of memory and he couldn’t see any alerts for it.</p> <p>At first, I wasn’t inclined to believe that his diagnosis of running out of memory was correct. Mainly because his Pod didn’t even restart! But then I looked at the graph of the memory use of the Pod. It did show the usual pattern: Memory usage would grow, reach its peak at the memory limit, and then suddenly drop.</p> <p>I’ve asked the developer for the gory details of the implementation. It turned out that the init process in the container would start a child process and wait for the result of it. If the child process would exit with an error, it would return an error to the requester and not terminate (because - why should it?).</p> <p>That is when it dawned to me - my alerting is effective only if container exits. This is usually the case when the init process of the container is OOMKilled. But there is no guarantee this will happen if a child of the init is OOMKilled. In the case where the container’s init tries to handle OOMKill by itself, my alerting is not triggering!</p> <h2>Trying the Existing Solutions</h2> <p>Given that OOMKills are as old as Unix, I thought: surely someone will have a solution for this already.</p> <p>I’ve ensued onto a frantic search for some kind of metric exporter for this. I just needed the number of OOMKill events in a pod, or at least in a Docker container. Here is what I’ve found:</p> <h3>cAdvisor</h3> <p>My first stop was cAdvisor itself. It turns out that cAdvisor is <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/1837" rel="nofollow">getting the OOMKill events, but not exporting them as a Prometheus metric and no one really seems to care.</a> So that was a dead-end.</p> <h3>kubernetes-oomkill-exporter</h3> <p>My second stop was <a href="https://github.com/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter" rel="nofollow">kubernetes-oomkill-exporter</a>. A very promising-sounding project with two huge disadvantages:</p> <ul><li>There is really no documentation for it, literally anywhere.</li> <li>It does not work.</li></ul> <p>I’ve tried the latest version of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter/0.3.0/images/sha256-b80875b903635f0336ea0b122b332e086da51ec5cd797de5d682dd14c3910b9f?context=explore" rel="nofollow">the Docker image</a>, but once started it crashes and burns with:</p> <pre><code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"</code></pre> <p>Going <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter/0.2.0/images/sha256-5e1b57f4ac0b57406ef067da3e83f743d70ff89aa1db717d41af2c699dc12f3a?context=explore" rel="nofollow">back one minor version</a> one gets the following output:</p> <pre><code>F1120 22:04:21.571246       1 main.go:73] Could not create log watcher
I1120 22:04:21.572066       1 main.go:64] Starting prometheus metrics</code></pre> <p>As it seems no one has committed any code to in over a year. It has a low number of stars (14). All that meant that I was back to square one.</p> <h2>Rolling my Own: <code>missing-container-metrics</code></h2> <p>Having a hard time finding an existing solution meant only one thing: I will have to write my own.</p> <p>A cursory look at <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/" rel="nofollow">Docker’s events</a> delivered everything I needed. There is an event called <code>oom</code>. Docker emits this event every time the OOMKiller process gets active in the container. Now I was only missing a piece of code that will listen to those events and export them as Prometheus metrics.</p> <p>This is how <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> was born. What it does is to connect to a local Docker instance (via <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>). It lists all existing containers as a starting point. And then it listens to Docker events. Using those events, it keeps track of the currently running containers. It also gathers the basic stats of each container it knows about:</p> <ul><li>Number of restarts</li> <li>Last exit code</li> <li>Number of OOMKills</li></ul> <p>By design, it is not Kubernetes specific. This means it can be used with a plain Docker. But it also has a couple of very convenient Kubernetes specific features.</p> <p>Whenever it finds a container label for the pod name or namespace, it adds them as a label to the exported metrics. Also, label naming is compatible with <code>kube-state-metrics</code>.</p> <p>This keeps things simple for metric joins in PromQL.</p> <h2>Running it in the Cluster</h2> <p>In a Kubernetes cluster, <code>missing-container-metrics</code> needs to run on every node. The simplest way to achieve this is to use a daemon-set. The source code comes with an example <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics#kubernetes" rel="nofollow">daemon set</a> deployment.</p> <h2>An Interesting Find Using <code>missing-container-metrics</code></h2> <p>The most interesting issue I’ve found was where I’ve least expected it: Fluentd!</p> <p>Fluentd log forwarder for node/pod/kubelet logs to the log aggregator. When the volume of logs was very high, Fluentd is OOMKilled.</p> <p>Looking at the details of how Fluentd works, it becomes clear what is going on.</p> <p>Fluentd has one main process (that ends up being init process in the container). This main process forks a worker process that forwards the logs. When the worker process dies for some reason (for example OOMKill), the main process starts a new one. This leads to an endless loop of spawn/OOMKill.</p> <p>The fact that Fluentd is the log forwarder is very unfortunate. OOMKill loop would stop the log forwarding, so you could not ‘see’ what is going on by inspecting the logs.</p> <h2>Epilogue</h2> <p>If you want to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is healthy, it is essential to alert on OOMKills. This enables you to know when processes hit their memory limits. Be it because of memory leaks or wrongly configured memory limits.</p> <p>It turns out that monitoring for OOMKills in Kubernetes is not as an easy task as one might think. Using <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> makes it much easier though.</p> <p>So go ahead, deploy <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> to your cluster. You might be surprised how many of OOMKills you have not been noticing.</p> <p>I hope that it will be useful to you, and will save you the time that I’ve spent searching for the solution.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Thermodynamics is really weird. Most people have probably encountered a bad explanation of the basics at some point in school, but probably don’t remember more than</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy is conserved</li>
<li>Entropy increases</li>
<li>There’s something called the ideal gas law/ideal gas equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy conservation is not very mysterious. Apart from some weirdness around defining energy in general, it’s just a thing you can prove from whatever laws of motion you’re using.</p>
<p>But <em>entropy</em> is very weird. You’ve heard that it measures “disorder” in some vague sense.
Maybe you’ve heard that it’s connected to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy%5F(information%5Ftheory)">Shannon entropy</a> of a probability distribution \(H(p) = \sum_x - p(x)\ln p(x)\).
Probably the weirdest thing about it is the law it obeys: It’s not conserved, but rather it <em>increases</em> with time.
This is more or less the only law like that in physics.</p>
<p>It gets even weirder when you consider that at least classical Newtonian physics is <em>time-symmetric</em>.
Roughly speaking, this means if you have a movie of things interacting under the laws of Newton, and you play it backwards, they’re still obeying the laws of Newton. An orbiting moon just looks like it’s orbiting in the other direction, which is perfectly consistent. A stone which is falling towards earth and accelerating looks like it’s flying away from earth and decelerating - exactly as gravity is supposed to do.</p>
<p>But if there’s some “entropy” quality out there that only increases, then that’s obviously impossible! When you played the movie backwards, you’d be able to tell that entropy was decreasing, and if entropy always increases, some law is being violated.
So what, is entropy some artefact of quantum mechanics? No, as it turns out. Entropy is an artefact of the fact that you can’t measure all the particles in the universe at once. And the fact that it seems to always increase is a consequence of the fact that matter is stable at large scales.</p>
<p>The points in this post are largely from E.T. Jaynes' <a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/macroscopic.prediction.pdf">Macroscopic Prediction</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-proof-that-entropy-doesn-t-always-increase">A proof that entropy doesn’t always increase</h2>
<p>Let \(X\) be the set of states of some physical system. Here I will assume that there is a finite number of states and time advances in discrete steps - there is some function \(T: X \to X\) which steps time forward one step. We assume that these dynamics are time-reversible in the weak sense that \(T\) is a bijection - every state is the future of exactly one “past” state.
Let \(S: X \to \mathbb{R}\) be some function. Assume \(S(x) \leq S(Tx)\) - in other words, \(S\) can never decrease.
Then \(S\) is constant, i.e \(S(x) = S(Tx)\).</p>
<p>Proof: Assume for contradiction \(S(x) &lt; S(Tx)\) for some \(x\). Since \(X\) is finite, let \(\sum_x S(x)\) be the sum of \(S\) over all states. Then clearly \(\sum_x S(x) = \sum_x S(Tx)\), since \(Tx\) just ranges over all the \(x\)s.
But on the other hand, we have \(S(x) \leq S(Tx)\) for all \(x\), and \(S(x) &lt; S(Tx)\) in at least one case. So we must have \(\sum_x S(x) &lt; \sum_x S(Tx)\) - contradiction.</p>
<p>This proof can be generalized to the continuous time and space case without too much trouble, for the types of dynamics that actually show up in physics (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s%5Ftheorem%5F(Hamiltonian)">Liouville’s Theorem</a>). The proof above still requires a <em>bounded</em> phase volume (corresponding to the finiteness of \(X\)). To generalize to other situations we need some more assumptions - the easiest thing is to assume that the dynamics are time-reversible in a stronger sense, and that this is compatible with the entropy in some way.</p>
<p>(You can find easy counterexamples in general, e.g. if \(X=\mathbb{Z}\) and the dynamics are \(T(x) = x+1\), then obviously we really do have that \(S(x) =x\) is increasing. Nothing to do about that.)</p>
<p>Anyways the bounded/finite versions of the theorems do hold for a toy thermodynamic system like particles in a (finite) box - here the phase volume really is bounded.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-meaning-of-entropy">The true meaning of entropy</h2>
<p>Okay, so what the hell is going on? Did your high school physics textbook lie to you about this?
Well, yes. But you’re probably never going to observe entropy going down in your life, so you can maybe rest easy.</p>
<p>Let \(X\) be the physical system under consideration again. But suppose now that we can’t observe \(x \in X\), but only some “high-level description \(p(x) \in Y\). Maybe \(x\) is the total microscopic state of every particle in a cloud of gas - their position and momentum - while \(p(x)\) is just the average energy of the particles (roughly corresponding to the temperature).
\(x\) is called a <em>microstate</em> and \(y = p(x)\) is called a <em>macrostate</em>.
Then the <em>entropy</em> of \(y \in Y\) is \(S(y) = \ln (p^{-1}(\{y\})\) - the logarithm of the number of microstates \(x\) where \(p(x) = y\). We say these are the microstates that <em>realize</em> the macrostate \(y\).</p>
<p>The connection with Shannon entropy is now that this is exactly the Shannon entropy of the uniform distribution over \(p^{-1}(y)\). This is the distribution you should have over microstates if you know nothing except the microstate.
In other words, the entropy measures your uncertainty about the microstate given that you know nothing except the macrostate.</p>
<p>There are more sophisticated versions of this definition in general, to account for the fact that</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, your microstates are probably sets of real numbers, and there are probably infinitely many compatible with the macrostate, so we need a notion of “continuous entropy” (usually called differential entropy, I think)</li>
<li>Your measurement of the macrostate is probably not that certain (but this turns out to matter surprisingly little for thermodynamic systems),</li>
</ul>
<p>but this is the basic gist.</p>
<h2 id="why-entropy-usually-goes-up">Why entropy usually goes up</h2>
<p>Okay, so why does entropy go up?
<em>Because there are more high-entropy states than low-entropy states</em>. That’s what entropy <em>means</em>.
If you don’t know anything about what’s gonna happen to \(x\) (in reality, you usually understand the dynamics \(T\) themselves, but have absolutely no information about \(x\) except the macrostate), it’s more likely that it will transfer to a macrostate with a higher number of representatives than to one with a low number of representatives.</p>
<p>This also lets us defuse our paradox from above. In reality, entropy doesn’t go down for literally every microstate \(x\).
It’s not true that \(S(p(Tx)) &gt; S(p(x))\) for all \(x\) - I proved that impossible above.
What <em>can</em> be true is this: given a certain macrostate, it’s more probable that entropy increases than that it decreases.</p>
<p>We can consider an extreme example where we have two macrostates \(L\) and \(H\), corresponding to low and high entropy.
Clearly the number of low-entropy states that go to a high-entropy state is exactly the same as the number of high-entropy states that go to a low-entropy state. That’s combinatorics.
But the <em>fraction</em> of low-entropy states that go to high-entropy is then necessarily larger than the fraction of high-entropy states that go to low-entropy states.</p>
<p>In other words, \(P(H(x_{t+1})|L(x_t)) &gt; P(L(x_{t+1})|H(x_t))\)</p>
<h2 id="why-entropy--almost--always-goes-up">Why entropy (almost) always goes up</h2>
<p>Okay, but that’s a lot weaker than “entropy always increases”! How do we get from here to there?
I could say some handwavy stuff here about how the properties of thermodynamic systems mean that the differences in the number of representatives between high-entropy and low-entropy states are massive - and that means the right-hand probability above can’t possibly be non-neglible. And that in general this works out so that entropy is almost guaranteed to increase.</p>
<p>But that’s very unsatisfying. It just happened to work out that way? I have a much more satisfying answer: entropy almost always increases because matter is stable at large scales.</p>
<p>Wait, what? What does that mean?</p>
<p>By “matter is stable at large scales”, I mean that the macroscopic behaviour of matter is predictable only from macroscopic observations. When a bricklayer builds a house, they don’t first go over them with a microscope to make sure the microstate of the brick isn’t going to surprise us later. And as long as we know the temperature and pressure of a gas, we can pretty much predict what will happen if we compress it with a piston.</p>
<p>What this means is that, if \(p(x) = p(x')\), then <em>with extremely high probability</em>, \(p(Tx) = p(Tx')\). It might not be literally certain, but it’s sure enough.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say we’re in the macrostate \(y\). Then there is some macrostate \(y'\) which is <em>extremely likely</em> to be the next one. For very nearly all \(x\) so that \(p(x) = y\), we have \(p(Tx) = y'\).
But this means that \(y'\) must have at least that many microstates representing it, since \(T\) is a bijection.
So the entropy of \(y'\) can at most be a <em>tiny</em> bit smaller than the entropy of \(y\) - this difference would be as tiny as the fraction of \(x\) with \(p(Tx) \neq y'\), so we can ignore it.</p>
<p>So unless something super unlikely happens and \(p(Tx) \neq y'\), entropy goes up.</p>
<p>By the way, this also explains what goes wrong with time-reversibility, and why in reality, you can easily tell that a video is going backwards. The “highly probably dynamics” \(Y \to Y\), which takes each macrostate the the most probable next state, don’t have to be time-reversible. For instance, let’s return to the two-macrostate system above.
Suppose that with 100% certainty, low-entropy states become high-entropy.
Let there be \(N_L\) low-entropy states and \(N_H\) high-entropy states.
Then, just because \(T\) is a bijection, there must be \(N_L\) high-entropy states that become low-entropy.
Now if \(N_H \gg N_L\), then practically all high-entropy states go to other high-entropy states.
So \(L \mapsto H\) but \(H \mapsto H\).</p>
<p>Of course in reality, if you start with a low-entropy state and watch this unfold for a <em>really</em> long time, you’ll eventually see it become a low-entropy state again. It’s just extremely unlikely to happen in a short amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-is-not-exactly-your-uncertainty-about-the-microstate">Entropy is not exactly your uncertainty about the microstate</h2>
<p>The entropy of a given macrostate is the uncertainty …</p></main></div></div>

                    <h2 id="ux-behavioral-economics">UX &amp; Behavioral Economics</h2><p>No matter how mature your digital platform is, there's always space for improvement. We've talked plenty about UX on this blog, understanding it as designing based on your users' insights. However, it's important to <strong>complement UX with behavioral science.</strong> This is a series of insights about human behavior that are <strong>true of all users.</strong> In the following blog posts, I'll reveal some behavioral insights that might help boost your conversions... <strong>Let's start with the first one: scarcity.</strong></p><h2 id="scarcity-motivates-conversions">Scarcity Motivates Conversions</h2><figure><img src="https://lightit.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="Scarcity example booking"></figure><p>Have you ever booked a hotel on Booking? If you did, it would probably be easy for you to understand the scarcity heuristic.</p><p>Scarcity is<strong> </strong>the event where a product/service is perceived as more attractive because it's presented as limited in availability. Limitation gives people a sense of quality, exclusivity and even gives them the famous FOMO (fear of missing out) on a great product or discount. <strong>The scarcity heuristic can be used to pressure people into taking action</strong></p><p>Booking's example is pretty straightforward. While you're making your reservation, Booking tells you <strong>how many rooms are still available</strong> and even the <strong>number of people that are looking at the hotel simultaneously</strong> as you (and might steal the room you wish!) This last one isn't only a scarcity strategy, but also a social norm we'll look into in the next blog post. This information pressures people into reserving quickly before the other people book the last room.</p><p>I'm not saying Booking's strategy is effective (personally, I believe it's a little exaggerated to the point it looks fake). Still, it's a clear example of using scarcity to <strong>rush customers to make their decision</strong>. </p><p>Another famous example is from a grocery store in Iowa that did an exciting experiment with the discount they offered for Campbell's soups. They always provided the same discount, though some days, they hanged a sign next to the cans that read "Limit 12 Per Person", while other days they didn't have a limit. Take a look at these impressive results.<strong> Customers bought 7 cans on average when the limit was imposed, compared to an average of 3 cans on days with no limit.</strong></p><h3 id="so-how-can-i-take-this-to-my-digital-platform"><br>So... how can I take this to my digital platform?</h3><p>There are several strategies you might try; the key is on<strong> trying different alternatives and tracking down the metrics</strong> so that you figure out which one works. <strong>Remember not to over-do it</strong>; no one trusts sites with discounts and deals that last forever. The typical "subscribe now and get 20% off on your first order" isn't that attractive if it has no time limit. Though, if it has, it might motivate people to make up their minds faster. Benefits must be perceived "here and now" to be more valuable.</p><figure><img src="https://lightit.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="Amazon scarcity example"></figure><p>Bear in mind these strategies aren't only useful for e-commerces, they can be used for other business models too. For example on social networks or communities, creating <strong>waiting lists, deadlines, asking for qualifications to join or limiting invites </strong>can really boost interest by giving a sense of &nbsp;<strong>exclusivity</strong> and FOMO. It's no news that exclusive things are more attractive... but have you ever wondered what came first? Attractiveness or exclusivity?</p><hr><p><strong>Stay tuned for the next post of this collection, </strong>Insights on Behavioral Economics to Improve Your Platform's Results. <strong>Part 2: Social Norms. </strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Subscribe to our newsletter &amp; follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lightit//" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peaking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) <a href="https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1321102111883579397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways. In response, we should start to think of increased sustainability as a type of productivity. </p><p>A vaccine to the COVID pandemic is the most obvious example. While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable. In fact, measured labor productivity from the vaccine will likely fall as lower-wage …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<h3>How much turkey meat does the United States produce?</h3>
</p></div>
<p><strong>2.5 million tons</strong> is the average turkey meat production in the United States between 1993 and 2018. </p>
<p>The United States leads the world in production of turkey meat. It’s followed far behind by France with 413 thousand tons of produced turkey, Germany with 367 thousand tons, Italy 311 thousand tons, Brazil 310 thousand tons, and then comes the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, Hungary and Poland.</p>

<h3>How many turkeys are cooked and eaten in the United States on Thanksgiving?</h3>
<p><strong>40 million turkeys</strong> is the correct number based on more recent reports by the National Turkey Federation and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-10-30/turkey-farmers-worry-about-thanksgiving-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise most likely you will see information that 46 million turkeys are eaten in the United States on Thanksgiving, but this number is out of date and because of that is incorrect. </p>
<p>Anyway, getting to sales and consumption of 40 million turkeys this year may be a challenging goal. Based on Bloomberg reports, there is an uncertainty and fear among turkey farmers about what will be the consumption of turkey this year. </p>
<p>At the moment there is a surplus of turkeys compared to stock levels in 2019, also there is a tendency for people to order smaller turkeys because of a potentially downsized Thanksgiving celebration in 2020. Turkey as a Thanksgiving dish faces additional pressure from substitute products, turkey breasts, Guinea fowls, hens, and similar replacements. The National Turkey Federation reminds people that they don’t have to restrict themselves in the purchase of turkey this year. After all, you can use turkey leftovers and make other tasty dishes, they say. </p>
<h3>How many turkey farms are there in the United States?</h3>
<p><strong>2,500</strong>, according to USDA. </p>
<h3>How many turkeys are raised every year in the United States?</h3>
<p><strong>229 million</strong>, according to USDA.</p>
<h3>How many turkeys are consumed in Canada on Thanksgiving?</h3>
<p><strong>2.5 million turkeys</strong> were purchased in Canada for Thanksgiving in 2019, that’s about <strong>39%</strong> of the yearly turkey sales in Canada. (<a href="https://www.turkeyfarmersofcanada.ca/industry-information/industry-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TurkeyFarmersofCanada</a>)</p>
<p>As a reminder, Thanksgiving in Canada is celebrated earlier on the second Monday of October. </p>
<h3>How much people in the United States will spend on turkey in 2020?</h3>
<p><strong>$1.095 billion</strong> is expected that Americans will spend on turkey only for Thanksgiving this year, according to Finder. </p>
<h3>What is the average weight of a turkey?</h3>
<p><strong>30</strong> <strong>pounds</strong> <strong>(13.6 kilograms)</strong> and slightly above that, but it weighed 16.83 pounds (7.63 kilograms) in 1960, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/talking-turkey-why-your-thanksgiving-dinner-weighs-more-1448015402#:~:text=In%201960%2C%20the%20average%20commercial,at%20more%20than%2030%20pounds." target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSJ</a>. That’s an increase of more than 78% for a 60 years period. A surprising fact about the turkey bird, but true. To put things in perspective the average weight of humans was 166.3 pounds (75.4 kilograms) in 1960 and it went up to 195.5 pounds (88.6 kilograms) nowadays, an increase of 18%, according to WSJ. </p>

<h3>How many Americans are planning to travel for Thanksgiving this year?</h3>
<p><strong>43% </strong>of people plan to travel on Thanksgiving, based on a survey by the American Hotel and Lodging Association, (TravelUpdate). Another recent survey by <a href="http://ir.tripadvisor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tripadvisor-reveals-2020-thanksgiving-travel-index-over-half-56" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripAdvisor</a> indicates that <strong>56%</strong> of Americans will travel for Thanksgiving this year, which is down from a 70% level in 2019. Obviously the cause is the pandemic. </p>
<p>According to data from AAA, the forecast for 2020 is that there will be 50 million travelers in the United States, down from 55.3 million travelers in 2019. This breaks for the first time the positive holiday travel trend that started in 2008. </p>

<h3>When do travelers make bookings?</h3>
<p><strong>61%</strong> of Thanksgiving travelers in 2019 booked their trips within six weeks before the holiday. This tendency is expected to repeat again in 2020 because of the lingering uncertainties in the travel sector (<a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/impacting-travel/early-thanksgiving-2020-travel-trends-emerge-from-latest-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TravelPulse</a>). </p>
<p>This year United Airlines expects 50% of its customers to book their Thanksgiving flights less than 30 days before their planned departure. That’s a 10 percentage points increase from last year when 40% of its customers booked their flight 30 days before departure. (United Airlines) </p>
<h3>What are the most booked destinations in 2020?</h3>
<p><strong>Top 10 Thanksgiving booked destinations</strong> until October 2020 on Skyscanner are (based on TravelPulse): </p>
<ol><li>New York, </li><li>Cancun; </li><li>Orlando; </li><li>Las Vegas; </li><li>Denver; </li><li>Los Angeles; </li><li>Fort Lauderdale; </li><li>Atlanta; </li><li>Chicago; </li><li>Tampa;</li></ol>
<h3>When do people plan to depart for Thanksgiving this year?</h3>
<p><strong>Wednesday, November 25</strong> is the departure date of the majority of bookings in 2020 according to Priceline. (<a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/holiday-travel/busiest-holiday-travel-days-christmas-thanksgiving-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TravelandLeasure</a>)</p>
<h3>When do people plan to return home from Thanksgiving this year?</h3>
<p><strong>Sunday, November 29</strong> is the date when most or <strong>36%</strong> of the bookings are scheduled with a return trip, according to Priceline. The rest will return on days before or after November 29. (TravelandLeasure)</p>
<h3>What is the impact of covid-19 pandemic on Thanksgiving bookings this year?</h3>
<p><strong>-16%</strong> less bookings until September this year compared to 2019, according to Guesty, with a note that the number may decrease or improve because of last minute bookings. (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/holiday-travel-bookings-lag-but-trend-in-last-minute-trips-might-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>)</p>
<p>Based on Guestyâ€™s findings lack of bookings may hit Christmas and New Yearâ€™s Eve harder because until September the bookings lag with -35% and â€“ 33% for each holiday respectively. (CNBC)</p>
<h3>How do people plan to celebrate Thanksgiving this year?</h3>
<ul><li><strong>52% </strong>of people will celebrate the holiday this year with their closest family,</li><li><strong>14% </strong>won’t celebrate it at all, and</li><li><strong>10%</strong> will travel somewhere for the holiday, according to Ipsos poll in the U.S. (<a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/thanksgiving-plans-COVID19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos</a>)</li></ul>

<h3>How many families gather each Thanksgiving for a dinner?</h3>
<p><strong>96%</strong> of American families gather for a feast (<a href="https://blog.nationwide.com/thanksgiving-fun-facts-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nationwide</a>). Based on the survey results shown above, this figure probably applies in normal times, not this year. </p>
<h3>What is the average number of dinner guests per household on Thanksgiving?</h3>
<p><strong>11</strong>&nbsp;is the average number of dinner guests per household (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad5ac488-046a-11ea-a958-5e9b7282cbd1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FinancialTimes</a>), and 28% of Americans had more than 12 people at their table in 2019, according to Nationwide. </p>

<article>
    <p>You know the feeling of watching your post quickly drowning in the Newest section of Hacker News, right?
It seems like pure, chaotic luck. Or is it?</p>
<p>I tried to crack the code of successful submissions.</p>
<p>I built a tool that parses Hacker News every two minutes and logs the state into the
database. The program has been working for <strong>14 days</strong> so far.</p>
<p>For the latest two weeks, there were <strong>13846</strong> stories, and only <strong>1403</strong> of them reached the first
page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>10.1329</strong> percents. It doesn’t sound too bad, does it? It turns out <strong>every tenth story
hits the first page</strong>.</p>
<p><em>All time values are in UTC.</em></p>
<h2 id="stories-and-chances-to-hit-the-first-page">Stories and chances to hit the first page</h2>

<p>It seems like Saturday and Sunday are the least active days when it comes to new stories.
But it means you have the biggest chance to hit the first page during these days.</p>
<h2 id="total-number-of-stories-and-chances-by-hour">Total number of stories and chances by hour</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look what about best hours to publish then.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wouldn’t post at 15:00 - 16:00 since it’s the lowest chance to hit the first page. Too many
submissions during these hours.</li>
<li>11:00 - 12:00 looks like a good spot, everyone is getting awake and your post is already waiting
them on the first page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="votes-and-overall-activity">Votes and overall activity</h2>
<p>The watcher continuously checks Hacker News and logs the current position and the score of every
story into the database.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the most active days and hours were.</p>

<ul>
<li>Saturday and Sunday are the least active days.</li>
<li>Monday is the most active day.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>00:00 - 10:00 are the least active hours</li>
<li>14:00 - 21:00 (UTC) are the most active hours on Hacker News.</li>
<li>15:00 - 19:00 (UTC) are the best hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finally-fun-facts">Finally, fun facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>48 stories hit the first page with literally 1 score point (you get it by default).</li>
<li>4 stories hit the first page with literally 2 score points.</li>
<li>590 stories needed 3 score points to appear on the first page.</li>
<li>318 stories needed 4 points.</li>
<li>143 stories needed 5 points.</li>
</ul>
<p>The longest living posts on the first page:</p>
<ul>
<li>65h13m56s  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25154128">Flash Animations Live Forever at the Internet Archive </a></li>

<p>There is enough data to come up with a specific interval of time required to get the first upvotes to
get to the first page.</p>

November 23, 2020 | https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/install-the-xfce-desktop-on-your-raspberry-pi/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/install-the-xfce-desktop-on-your-raspberry-pi/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this article you’ll learn how to install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI. We’ll take a minimal install of the Raspberry PI operating system as a starting point. The XFCE installation on your Raspberry PI includes setting up all necessary building blocks, such as: display server, display manager, session manager, window manager and desktop environment.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>When you install the default Raspberry PI operating system, it presents you with the PIXEL desktop. The Raspberry PI foundation developed and maintains the PIXEL desktop. It offers a user-friendly desktop, with all basic features and applications included. For example: an application menu, a file manager, a text editor, etc. PIXEL is lightweight, meaning that it doesn’t consume a lot of RAM and CPU resources. This makes it run smoothly, even on a Raspberry PI Zero with only 512 MB of RAM.</p>
<p>So why would you want to switch to another desktop, such as XFCE? I can think of a few reasons:</p>
<ul><li>As a Linux desktop user, you probably did your fair share of desktop environment hopping. You might have settled on the XFCE desktop. Consequently, you prefer to run the XFCE desktop also on your Raspberry PI.</li><li>Your Raspberry PI serves as a Linux learning platform. You would like to find out what it takes to install a desktop environment from scratch.</li></ul>
<h3>The new Raspberry PI 400</h3>
<p>Over the years the Raspberry PI has gotten ever more powerful. It’s no longer just an embedded Linux board. Especially the Raspberry PI 4 packs enough CPU power and RAM for usage as you daily desktop computer. The Raspberry PI foundation thinks so too. Just look at the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry PI 400</a> model they recently released. They market it as a “complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard”:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="365" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400.png" alt="Image of the Raspberry PI 400. It's a Raspberry PI 4 build into a keyboard. Marketed as a complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400.png 900w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400-300x122.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400-768x311.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>
<p>You no longer need to restrict yourself to the PIXEL desktop. The Raspberry PI 4 comes a quad-core 64-bit CPU and 2, 4 or 8 GB RAM. More than sufficient to run a ‘real’ Linux desktop such as XFCE, KDE or Gnome.</p>
<h3>Why the XFCE desktop</h3>
<p>So why did I select the XFCE desktop for this article? In my opinion the XFCE desktop sits nicely between the PIXEL desktop and the more resource intensive desktops such as Gnome and KDE. It offers a full desktop experience, while still being lightweight and with snappy responsiveness. The XFCE desktop is stable, well maintained and available in all major Linux distributions. It’s the desktop environment I personally select, when installing a Linux desktop on older hardware or in a virtual machine.</p>
<h2>What do you need</h2>
<p>To complete the steps in this article and install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI, you need the following:</p>
<ul><li>Any Raspberry PI 4 board, including the new Raspberry PI 400.</li><li>A power supply for the Raspberry PI board.</li><li>A micro-SD card of 8 GB or more in size.</li><li>A USB mouse</li><li>A USB keyboard (not needed for the Raspberry PI 400).</li><li>A computer monitor or TV.</li><li>A cable for connecting the HDMI output to your monitor or TV.</li></ul>
<p>Throughout this article, I assume you already installed the Raspberry PI operating system. I recommend the <em>Lite</em> edition. The <em>Lite</em> edition of the Raspberry PI operating system does not include a graphical desktop environment. That way you start with a clean slate.</p>
<p>I’ll be using my Raspberry PI 4 with 4 GB RAM to install the XFCE desktop. I already installed the <em>Lite</em> edition of the Raspberry PI operating system on it. Furthermore, I added a new user account for user <code>pragmalin</code> and removed the default <code>pi</code> user account, for security purposes. Although not necessary, I recommend that you start with the same foundation. Refer to the previously published tutorial on how to <a href="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/perform-a-minimal-install-on-your-raspberry-pi/">perform a minimal install on your Raspberry PI</a> for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<h2>Graphical desktop components</h2>
<p>Before diving right into the installation of XFCE on your Raspberry PI, I would like to present a brief overview of all the components that go into a Linux graphical desktop. This theoretical background information is optional. Feel free to skip to the next section to continue with the hands-on XFCE installation part on your Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>Refer to the following illustration for an overview of all components:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="269" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers.png" alt="Illustration showing all the components that go into a graphical desktop on Linux. To install the XFCE desktop on a Raspberry PI we need these components: Xorg, lightdm, xfce4-session, xfwm4 and xfce4." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers.png 410w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></figure>
<p>Note the added text after the arrow in the illustration. These are the specific components we’ll install for our XFCE desktop. For a Linux graphical desktop, the specific components can differ. For example, a Gnome desktop environment typically uses the <em>gdm</em> display manager instead of <em>lightdm</em>.</p>
<h3>Display server</h3>
<p>In order to do anything graphically, as opposed to just the basic command line, you need a display server. It provides the foundation needed by all the other components. It handles outputting pixels on the display and detecting input events from the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<h3>Display manager</h3>
<p>Think of the display manager as the login screen. It is the first thing that gets started if the operating system supports a graphical desktop. On this screen you enter your username and password to login. Furthermore, it offers you a choice of the desktop session to start.</p>
<h3>Session manager</h3>
<p>After logging in, the display manager hands control over to the session manager. Simply put, the session manager manages the state of the desktop of the logged in user(s). So which applications are running and what their window state and position is. Furthermore, the session manager makes it possible to save your desktop when you logout. Upon the next login it can automatically restore your desktop for you.</p>
<h3>Window manager</h3>
<p>The window manager controls the placement, movement and look of all windows and their controls (button, check box, etc). Its the one that draws the border around each window and adds the title bar. Additionally, the window manager enables you to tile, stack and move windows around.</p>
<h3>Desktop environment</h3>
<p>To have a fully functional graphical desktop you still need a bit more. For example an application menu, a task-bar panel showing running applications and notification icons. And then your basic suite of applications such as a file manager, terminal program, text editor, etc. The desktop environment combines all these parts. Its goal is to provide you with a cohesive and productive graphical user experience.</p>
<h2>Install the XFCE desktop components</h2>
<p>At this point you have a good understanding of what components you need, to install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI. Time to get our hands dirty. We’ll install all the XFCE desktop components in one go on your Raspberry PI. This includes:</p>
<ul><li><em>Xorg</em> display server</li><li><em>lightdm</em> display manager</li><li><em>xfce4-session</em> session manager</li><li><em>xfwm4</em> window manager</li><li><em>xfce4</em> desktop environment</li></ul>
<p>Power up your Raspberry PI and login with your username and password at the console. Next, run the following command to install the XFCE desktop components on your Raspberry PI:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="769" height="569" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install.png" alt="Terminal screenshot of installing the XFCE desktop related packages on the Raspberry PI. The following command is used: sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install.png 769w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px"></figure>
<p>As you can see in the last line of the screenshot, all XFCE desktop components consume about 1 GB of disk space. With all the XFCE desktop components installed on your Raspberry PI, we continue with setting them up.</p>
<h2>Setup the XFCE desktop components</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we installed all XFCE desktop components on your Raspberry PI. As a next step we make sure the right desktop components are selected. If you started with a minimal install of the Raspberry PI operating system, this will most likely be the case already. However, if you previously installed a different desktop environment, we need to double-check this selection, to make sure it works for an XFCE desktop.</p>
<h3>Select the display server</h3>
<p>You probably only have one display server installed (<em>Xorg</em>), so you do not have to explicitly select one. However, it could be that you didn’t have a display sever installed before. In this case we need to verify that the display server gets started during boot.</p>
<p>Systemd should handle this for us. Without the presence of a display server, Systemd’s default boot target is the multi user shell. Also called <code>multi-user.target</code>. When installing a display server, Systemd’s default boot target should change to a graphical multi user shell. This one is called <code>graphical.target</code>.</p>
<p>To determine Systemd’s default boot target, run this command:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl get-default</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="713" height="33" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the output of running the &quot;sudo systemctl get-default&quot; command. It should output &quot;&quot;graphical.target&quot;." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default.png 713w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default-300x14.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default-700x33.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px"></figure>
<p>It should output <code>graphical.target</code>. If it doesn’t, then you can set it manually by running the command:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target</code>.</p>
<h3>Select the display manager</h3>
<p>The following component to select is the display manager. We want to select <em>lightdm</em> as the display manager. Easily achieved by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="416" height="23" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows what command to run for selecting the lightdm display manager." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager.png 416w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager-300x17.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px"></figure>
<h3>Select the session manager</h3>
<p>Next we’ll go ahead and select the session manager. Type this command in the terminal:</p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="764" height="153" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows how to select the session manager, with the help of the update-alternatives command. Make sure to select startxfce4 here and not xfce4-session." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager.png 764w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px"></figure>
<p>On this screen we need to make sure <em>startxfce4</em> is selected as the session manager. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> if startxfce4 is already selected, otherwise enter the number of the <em>startxfce4</em> session.</p>
<p>A bit odd, right? In an earlier section I mentioned that we want the <em>xfce4-session</em> session manager. The selection menu lists <em>xfce4-session</em>, so why not pick it? The <em>startxfce4</em> file consists of a script that initializes the XFCE session and under the hood calls the <em>xfce4-session</em> executable for us. This makes <em>startxfce4</em> the better option here.</p>
<h3>Select the window manager</h3>
<p>Continue with the selection of the window manager. Run the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="805" height="55" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_window_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the update-alternatives command for selecting the xfwm4 window manager." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_window_manager.png 805w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_window_manager-300x20.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_window_manager-768x52.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px"></figure>
<p>On my Raspberry PI, <em>xfwm4</em> is the only available window manager. Therefore no additional configuration is needed.</p>
<h3>Select the desktop environment</h3>
<p>You select the desktop environment on the login screen. So now would be the right time to reboot our Raspberry PI and wait for the login screen to show up. On the top right corner of the screen, there is a little icon you can click. Select <em>Xfce Session</em> from the drop-down menu:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="200" height="96" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_desktop_environment.png" alt="Screenshot of the lightdm session manager that shows how to select Xfce Session on the login screen."></figure>
<h2>Configure the XFCE desktop</h2>
<p>At this point we completed installing and selecting the right components for the XFCE desktop on our Raspberry PI. In this section we’ll make some final configurations for our XFCE desktop. If you …</p></div></div>

<p>
  2020-11-23
</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I published <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/11/metrics.html">Metrics for Oil 0.8.4</a>.  It
establishes a rough performance baseline before enabling garbage collection.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>small update</strong> to that baseline, released with <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.5/">Oil 0.8.5</a>.  I
noticed some problems with the benchmarks after partially integrating the
garbage collector (which now works on small examples!)</p>
<p>This post doesn't invalidate anything I've said in the past.  It just adds some
detail!</p>
 
<a name="fix-dont-use-asan-when-benchmarking"></a>
<h2>Fix: Don't use ASAN When Benchmarking</h2>
<p>The <code>mycpp-examples</code> benchmark shows how much we can speed up small pieces of
code by translating them from staticall-typed Python to C++.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/benchmarks.wwz/mycpp-examples/">benchmarks/mycpp-examples 0.8.4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.5/benchmarks.wwz/mycpp-examples/">benchmarks/mycpp-examples 0.8.5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Silly bug: I was building the C++ code with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=asan#asan">ASAN</a>!  When ASAN is
on, the compiler generates code that uses "shadow memory" to detect memory
unsafety at runtime.  This increases the size of every allocation, and makes
code slower.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>classes</code> went from taking <strong>728</strong> ms to <strong>1.9</strong> ms</li>
<li><code>length</code> went from taking <strong>734</strong> ms to <strong>167</strong> ms</li>
<li><code>cartesian</code> went from <strong>1033</strong> MB of heap usage to <strong>611</strong> MB</li>
<li><code>parse</code> went from <strong>972</strong> MB of heap usage to <strong>137</strong> MB</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Python-to-C++ speedups look even more impressive now.  (But remember
that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> is <strong>not</strong> a general purpose tool.)</p>
<a name="fix-a-python-process-cant-measure-a-shell-child-process"></a>
<h2>Fix: A Python Process Can't Measure A Shell Child Process</h2>
<p>The <code>compute</code> benchmark measures the Oil interpreter vs. bash and Python on
small code examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/benchmarks.wwz/compute/">benchmarks/compute 0.8.4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.5/benchmarks.wwz/compute/">benchmarks/compute 0.8.5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that bash and Python both used a minimum of 6 MB of virtual memory
(<code>Max RSS</code>).  However, this turned out to be a <strong>benchmark bug</strong>.  We were
using <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/blob/master/benchmarks/time_.py">benchmarks/time_.py</a>, a tool written in Python, to measure the
memory of a bash process!</p>
<p>Specifically, we used <code>subprocess.call()</code> and then <code>resource.getrusage()</code>.
This doesn't work because Python first <strong>forks its larger address space</strong>, and
then calls <code>exec()</code> to start bash.</p>
<p>That is, we measured the memory usage of Python, not bash.  This person ran
into the same issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13880724/python-getrusage-with-rusage-children-behaves-stangely">Python getrusage with RUSAGE_CHILDREN behaves strangely?</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="why-i-wrote-a-timing-tool-in-c"></a>
<h3>Why I Wrote A Timing Tool in C</h3>
<p>To fix this, I first changed <code>time_.py</code> to shell out to <code>/usr/bin/time</code>, a GNU
utility written in C which has a small address space.  Two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only has precision in ticks or hundredths of a second, which isn't good
enough for our benchmarks.  The ratios shifted significantly because of this
inaccuracy.</li>
<li>It also tends to print error messages to its output, which is bad for
automation.  We want clean TSV output.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about bash's <code>time</code> keyword (which Oil implements)?</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have a way to get the exit code or memory usage.</li>
<li>It's hard to make it append to a TSV file.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/blob/master/benchmarks/time-helper.c">benchmarks/time-helper.c</a>.  It's surprising to
find these basic deficiencies in common tools!  I guess I need to build
something better into Oil, but that's more work on top of a big pile.</p>
<a name="update-the-parser-is-slower"></a>
<h2>Update: The Parser is Slower</h2>
<p>The parsing benchmarks compare <code>$sh -n</code> across different shells on 10 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.4/benchmarks.wwz/osh-parser/">benchmarks/osh-parser 0.8.4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.5/benchmarks.wwz/osh-parser/">benchmarks/osh-parser 0.8.5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The 0.8.5 release is the first one where <code>oil-native</code> is <strong>slower</strong> than bash!</p>
<ul>
<li>oil-native: <strong>222</strong> lines/ms and <strong>593</strong> lines/ms</li>
<li>bash: <strong>247</strong> lines/ms and <strong>645</strong> lines/ms</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe this is due to the partially-integrated garbage collector.  <strong>Every
C++ function</strong> now has a <code>StackRoots</code> invocation to register pointers.</p>
<p>This operation should be very cheap, but I would guess that it also inhibits
some compiler optimizations.  We're passing pointers to locals to be stored in
a global (or thread local) data structure.</p>
<p>I mentioned this possibility in the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/parser-benchmarks.html#caveats">Caveats to January's performance
post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I expect performance to go up and down in future releases, but in the long
term it should be faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I probably won't have time to optimize the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mycpp#mycpp">mycpp</a> translation of the
parser for many months, but it should be possible with enough effort.  Remember
that Oil is "hilariously unoptimized".  (As always, I can use help!)</p>
<a name="whats-next"></a>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>After fixing these benchmarks, I had a nice experience with
<a href="https://builds.sr.ht/">builds.sr.ht</a>, the Sourcehut build service.  I was
driven there by the increasing flakiness of Travis CI.</p>
<p>I want to write a blog post about it, but I should really get back to work on
the <strong>garbage collector</strong>.</p>
<a name="buildssrht-and-toil"></a>
<h3>builds.sr.ht and Toil</h3>
<p>Here's a brief outline instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>It took me a matter of minutes to get a test build running.  The service is
snappy and the docs are good.</li>
<li>I ported Oil's continuous build in a day or so.  We have a complex build with
many tasks because we use a lot of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metaprogramming#metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a>.
<ul>
<li>I described the "Toil" continuous build back in March: <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/03/release-0.8.pre3.html#shell-the-good-parts">Oil 0.8.pre3 - A
Line Editor and a Continuous
Build</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This leads to an interesting milestone: <code>services/toil</code> is a shell script and
web interface that runs on <strong>multiple CI services</strong>.
<ul>
<li>A concrete benefit of this is that we could use sourcehut's FreeBSD support
and Travis CI's OS X support in parallel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I want to write a bit about the style of Toil.  I would call it "distributed
shell programming with <strong>concretions</strong>" (rather than abstractions).
<ul>
<li>It uses TSV, JSON, and a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=wwz#wwz">wwz</a> archive of logs.  That is, we don't
serialize and deserialize "objects".  We just work with well-formed data.
The shell can help with this.</li>
<li>It spans Dreamhost, sourcehut, Travis CI, and my own development machine.
(I'd also like to try it on Github Actions.) It's a "heterogeneous"
distributed system.  It uses <code>ssh</code> for auth.</li>
<li>What do these platforms have in common?  They are based on <strong>Linux</strong>, which
can run a <strong>shell</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’ve heard “a Formula One car has enough downforce that it can drive upside down on the ceiling” so many times but have never had any proof of this. I, for one, would love to see this put to the test, but I doubt that a Formula One team would risk their hard work by running it upside down just to settle an idle curiosity. I would love to test this myself but not having full, unbridled access to a Formula One team is just the start of problems with this plan. But, here at Claytex, I have access to a Motorsports grade vehicle dynamics simulation suite that is used extensively throughout Formula One.</p>



<p>Almost everywhere I read/hear says it’s possible from an aerodynamics point of view, but there is a lot more to it than just aerodynamics. As you can’t start the F1 car upside down at speed, already on the ceiling, the most feasible way of getting an F1 car on the ceiling is to start on the flat, upright and gain speed  normally. Then when sufficient speed has been gained, progressively move up a concave wall along a pipe, maintaining speed, then when holding the inverted driving for a period and then working back down again.</p>



<p>Approaching this from a vehicle and aero-dynamics aspect this manoeuvre provides more difficulty than just running, steady-state, upside down indefinitely. This would require having enough power to raise the car up the wall, while also maintaining enough speed to maintain enough down force; secondly there is the surface of the “pipe” to consider, while I assume there to be enough grip, the articulation of the suspension due to the curvature could cause instability or lifting of one/two of the wheels enough to loose grip/contact. This last point is also coupled with the ability of the tyres to produce enough lateral grip to raise the vehicle in less than optimum conditions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.claytex.com/blog/vesyma-motorsports-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="VeSyMA - Motorsports library (opens in a new tab)">VeSyMA – Motorsports library</a> has several vehicle models, including an open wheel vehicle that approximates a Formula One car from several seasons ago in many aspects. The suspension system is similar to that of a formula one car with push rod actuated, double wishbone suspension. It also has similar weight distribution, mass and aerodynamics to that of an F1 car.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.claytex.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chassis_New.png" alt="VeSyMA - Motorsports library vehicle model"></figure></div>



<p>While this is not a common road model to create, the road models in VeSyMA, are able to create a surface following a centreline and with banking to match a pipe. The road model generation functions within the Suspensions library to create a road, but with a bit of fettling, a road model was created. This created a single track for the vehicle to contact and the  <br>centreline for the driver to follow that would be representative of the inside of a pipe.</p>



<p>The driver used was the closed loop driver within the Suspensions library. Other than that it was finding a speed and angle at which the vehicle is stable and able to rise up the wall.</p>



<p>On the straight and flat the vehicle has enough down force to create it’s own weight in down force at 80mph, but this would allow zero force from the tyres. Therefore it was a test to see what was the minimum speed at which it would stably complete the manoeuvre. Ramping up in 5mph increments yielded a lot of failures, the main cause being lack of rear grip, upside down oversteer and then loss of down force (now up force) and it falls. This was normally when it reaches the top and attempts to straighten out to stay upside down for a period. Below is an example of that type of failure.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.claytex.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Loop-Fail.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>While the requisite speed was higher than expected, it was eventually able to complete the full loop at 125mph:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.claytex.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Loop-Both-Views-Small.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The wheel loads were a little odd, with the highest increase in vertical (relative to the vehicle) loads being at opposing corners. The front left and rear right initially receiving an increased load of 15%-20% and the other wheels reduced by a similar amount. With the roughly 45/55 front rear weight distribution, when upside down this caused a much larger difference between the front and rear than at the same speed driving along normally. </p>



<p>After a short amount of aerodynamics tuning, where the upside down vertical wheel forces were brought a lot closer together to balance the vehicle, this speed was brought down to 105mph. But this was only able to be done using a large change to the front and rear wing. With each mph lower the ability to control the vehicle lessens, and the smallest error or instability seems fatal to this stunt.</p>



<p>With infinite ability to change the aerodynamics then the speed could be lowered massively but then it would move further away from an F1 car. But with a small amount of tuning to the aerodynamics then a conservative target speed of the car upside down could be as low as 110mph.</p>



<p>So that’s a start; next, full scale testing anyone?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>At the end of August, I arrived in Shanghai on a trip back from London. After two weeks of quarantine, I emerged on a smoggy Monday morning thrilled for my first taste of freedom, until I realized that I had made a careless but dire mistake: I forgot to bring my mobile SIM card.</p>



<p>Without my phone number to verify my identity and confirm that I had followed proper Covid-19 precautions, the health code I had been assigned by authorities stayed red. The day I left quarantine, I tried to check into a hotel in Shanghai. When the man at the front desk saw my code, he eyed me warily, as if I had a scarlet letter etched onto my forehead, and only allowed me to check in after scrutinizing my physical quarantine papers. That night, when I met up for dinner with a friend and showed him my code, he recoiled. “Ugh. Please put that thing away,” he said, only half-jokingly. “It makes me anxious just to look at it.” We were in a city where there had been no cases of local transmission in months, and as a young, tech-savvy, white-collar worker with resources and workarounds, I was luckier than most. Yet in that moment, I felt like a pariah: unregistered and unrecognized on the outskirts of society.</p>



<p>In China, your phone number is your identity. Over the last two decades, the country leapfrogged from a relatively antiquated technological infrastructure straight into the mobile internet, which is now deeply embedded in every facet of life. By the time I returned to live in Beijing in 2018, bright-yellow share bikes were all over the streets, and savvy beggars panhandled with QR codes. My phone was suddenly my wallet, my transportation ticket, and my source of nourishment, entertainment, and socializing. With it, I could order dinner and pay rent, browse through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/magazine/blued-china-gay-dating-app.html">queer dating prospects</a>, and get <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/27/china-embraces-consumer-genetic-testing/">my genes sequenced</a>. Without it, I could barely function. More than anywhere else in the world, in China, one’s digital and physical selves are conflated. An online presence confirms an offline existence.</p>



<p>Since the onset of the pandemic, this has been pushed even further. This past February, in an attempt to control the virus’s spread, the government assigned every smartphone owner in China a health QR code. First trialed in the city of Hangzhou, the system launched nationwide on the popular platforms WeChat and Alipay, which critics have compared to the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborating with Amazon and Facebook to track the health of all their users. To obtain a code, you have to register your name, travel history, identification, and phone number. This information is then correlated with the tracking data on your device, to assess if you’ve had contact with potential Covid-19 patients. Then, you are assigned a color — green, yellow, or red — which determines whether you will be allowed to move freely, enter buildings, and take public transportation.</p>



<p>As the Chinese internet has evolved within the boundaries of the Great Firewall, I’ve come to view the space as a walled garden. The metaphor is not mine but stolen from Lu Wei, the former deputy head of the Chinese government’s propaganda department. Lu once <a href="https://chinacopyrightandmedia.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/lu-wei-concentrate-positive-energy-online-build-the-chinese-dream-together/">proclaimed</a> the country’s cyberspace as a “spiritual garden, which worships virtue and the good” (which could refer to anything from patriotism and pandas to filial piety) and condemns the “false, the bad, and the ugly” (hip-hop, tattoos, or Winnie the Pooh, for instance). Just as the imperial gardens of ancient China were carefully pruned spaces sealed off from the outside world, the country’s internet, firewalled from the global web, has become an isolated ecosystem, governed by an opaque and arbitrary set of rules.</p>



<p>In recent months, these garden walls have been upgraded to safeguard not only the “spiritual” but the physical health of inhabitants. And in the eyes of authorities, the two are increasingly one and the same. In May, proactive officials in Hangzhou <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/tech/hangzhou-health-app-intl-hnk/index.html">proposed</a> expanding the health code system and integrating it even more into daily life. Citizens would be assigned a health score between 0 and 100 that would fluctuate based on lifestyle choices: 15,000 daily steps could boost a score by 5 points, while 200 millimeters of baijiu (a noxious Chinese liquor) could mean a reduction of 1.5 points. In September, officials in the neighboring city of Suzhou followed suit, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3100516/suzhou-city-takes-page-chinas-social-credit-system-civility-code-rates">introducing plans for a “civility code”</a> that would apply a similar rubric to activities, such as doing volunteer work and jaywalking. Both plans were quickly retracted in the wake of a public backlash, but the technology needed to implement them is already in place, and most crucially, so is the vision of this future world.</p>



<p>Today, to truly enter China is no longer a matter of simply swapping out a SIM card. To step into the garden is to inhabit another world, to hail a DiDi instead of an Uber, scroll through a pruned Weibo feed instead of an unruly Twitter one, date on Momo instead of Tinder, dance to a BTS hit on Douyin instead of a Megan Thee Stallion remix on TikTok. Given how inextricably entwined our offline selves are with our online personas, to live inside the garden requires the creation of a particular kind of identity<em>. </em>After all,<em> </em>our digital worlds do not simply reflect who we are: they shape that person. The Yi-Ling I am on Facebook is a different person from the Yi-Ling I am on WeChat (more distracted, more creative, much more cautious), with different habits, friends, and communities. When the headlines warn of a bifurcated internet — with China strengthening its Great Firewall and Secretary of State Pompeo urging the construction of a “Clean Fortress” around American data — it is important to remember that these divisions extend down to the intimate and the individual, each crack in cyberspace running deep into flesh and bone.</p>



<p>Having straddled the fault lines of two digital ecosystems all of my life, the division runs deep through my psyche. Who will I become in a digitally bifurcated world? Can these selves ever be reconciled? And beyond that, will it ever be possible to tell a more plural and expansive story of the global internet, one that can weave together strands of messy identities and frame a larger picture? </p>



<p>When I got my new SIM card in Beijing two days later, I felt wonderfully and troublingly whole again. I could hail a cab, get a haircut,<strong> </strong>have a box of fresh, imported kiwis delivered to my doorstep. I was both delighted by the world that opened up before me — limitless, seamless, and virus-free — and unnerved by the deal that I had made: data for convenience, privacy for safety. I was back in the garden, left to contemplate what I might gain, what more I might lose, and what I had already lost.</p>

		<time datetime="2020-11-23T00:00:00+02:00">2020-11-23</time>
	</header>

	<p>Back in spring 2019, I was a student working as an intern at the Intel Open
Source Graphics Center in Finland. I was mainly focused on improving
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools/">igt-gpu-tools</a>, the test suite that runs each time a patch is submitted for
the i915 kernel driver. I really liked the work I was doing there, and enjoyed
interacting with all of the people on site. While I was there, I had an
opportunity to say “no” to an assigned task that I considered unethical.</p>
<p>Naturally, lots of Intel kernel developers were working on fixing bugs and
implementing new features. When a developer wants to add a new feature to their
kernel driver, they also need to provide a patch for a user-space program to
exercise the feature in a real-world scenario and prove that the new user-space
API is sensible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. For instance, when adding HDR support to i915, the kernel
developers worked with the Kodi team.</p>
<p>At that time, I had just been nominated as release manager for the Wayland and
Weston projects. Additionally, some Intel engineers were working on upstreaming
Weston patches to add a new feature to their driver. In fact, the kernel
patches were ready to be merged and only blocked by the user-space
requirements. Some deadlines were set too, so it was important to get the
patches merged in a timely manner. My manager asked me to help with the
upstreaming process. That was a pretty good idea – because my experience could
help Intel developers to learn how to contribute to Weston, and because I like
mentoring people. So what was the catch?</p>
<p>It turned out the feature being developed was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection">HDCP</a>. It’s a form of <abbr title="Digital Restrictions Management">DRM</abbr> that encrypts the video
stream between the GPU and the screen. I’m personally not okay with DRM in
general, and I find DRM to be unethical. I’m not going to start to argue why I
feel this way, because it doesn’t really matter in the context of this article.
Feel free to replace DRM with whatever you find unethical.</p>
<p>So, I started participating in meetings and discussing how to get the
HDCP patches merged. I wasn’t very comfortable with the whole situation, and
tried to stay away from it when possible. I considered saying “no”, but I was
scared. I was only working at Intel for a few weeks, I was still a student, I
didn’t know my teammates and managers too well, and I was interested in
eventually getting a job offer. I just continued as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>At some point, after asking advice and discussing with some friends, I realized
that I ought to speak up. If I didn’t say “no” this time, it would get a lot
more difficult to say “no” the next time. So I ignored the anxiety and clumsily
explained to my manager that I’d like to stop working on HDCP.</p>
<p>To my surprise, my manager just said that it was fine, that there was no
problem. After this event, absolutely nothing else changed, and at some point I
even got an employment offer. When I recall it now, I can only tell myself that
it was a lot of fuss for nothing. In hindsight, I should’ve been less scared
and said no earlier, but in these situations it’s easy to imagine nightmare
scenarios in your head!</p>

            <p>After receiving so much feedback and inquiries on <a href="https://languageburo.com/blog/steps-for-translating-a-website-for-a-new-market">our last post about website translation</a>, we came up with this follow up. Here are some of the best practices we’ve used to achieve excellent results for our clients needing web or mobile application translation and localization. </p>
<p>Are you planning to expand your startup abroad? Wondering how you can translate your web or mobile application and reach a wider audience? You’re in the right place because we’re going to share some of the best practices for localization in this article.</p>
<figure><iframe src="//youtube.com/embed/3zMdDT2nlMo" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="825" height="464"></iframe></figure>
<p>Translating your app allows you to <a href="https://languageburo.com/blog/steps-for-translating-a-website-for-a-new-market">enter a new market</a>, improve brand awareness, and increase revenue. Going global unlocks huge potential; international customers <a href="https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing">prefer to use their native language</a> online. To have greater success, you need to provide your apps in their language. </p>
<p>Web and mobile app translation and localization go beyond just content adaptation. Your goal should be to create a custom made application suitable for your target market. </p>
<p><strong>Here are nine best practices of translating a web or mobile application.</strong></p>
<h2>Set Your Strategy</h2>
<p>One of the first steps in app localization is to identify your target market and language. Analyze your existing users to find if there’s any untapped potential. Before you start expanding internationally, ask yourself if there’s a need for your app in the market you’re planning to target. </p>
<p>Ensure your app is localization-friendly beforehand. Separate the source code from the actual content that’s going to be translated later. Prior app internationalization will save you a lot of time and money throughout the project. </p>
<h2>Hire a Professional Translation Agency</h2>
<p>When adapting content from one language to another, it’s essential to ensure a seamless user experience. That’s why you should <a href="https://languageburo.com/professional-translation-services/website-translation-services">hire a professional translation company</a> to translate, optimize, and localize your app. </p>
<p>Professional translation agencies perform app localization, which includes formatting, editing, and cultural adaptation. Some languages change word length or writing direction when translated; with professionals’ help, you won’t need to worry about these alterations.<br>
Use a Translator that works with the file format you provide</p>
<p><a href="https://languageburo.com/professional-translation-services">Professional translators</a> can work with many file formats and make sure they can work with the files as you provide them. This way, you can integrate their work directly into your app and revision control system, without further work. Also, this will streamline the process and reduce involuntary human errors. For instance, at Language Buró, we will deliver the translated copy in the same format as the original.</p>
<figure><img src="https://languageburo.com/content/1-blog/10-how-to-translate-a-web-or-mobile-application/resource-bundles-for-translating-app.jpg" alt="Isolate all text and messages to translate in resource bundles"></figure>
<h2>Resource Bundles</h2>
<p>Isolate all text and messages to translate in resource bundles; these are special files in your application that contain the original text to be translated. All popular web and app development frameworks provide libraries to achieve this from the get-go. For example, if developing for Apple devices, the first step to localize your app is to export the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LocalizingYourApp/LocalizingYourApp.html">development language or base localization for translation</a>. For Android, you should start <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages">creating the locale directories and resource files</a>. </p>
<figure><img src="https://languageburo.com/content/1-blog/10-how-to-translate-a-web-or-mobile-application/provide-context-for-your-translation-agency.jpg" alt="Provide instructions on the application interface so that the translation agency can understand your message’s context"></figure>
<h2>Provide Context</h2>
<p>Be sure to provide instructions on the application interface so that the translation agency can understand your message’s context. Take your time to help translators understand what your strings should achieve. Give them access to the UI, provide screenshots, and share your notes. Having context will allow your professional partner to translate the app clearly and accurately. </p>

<h2>Localize Visual Content</h2>
<p>Some languages require more space and characters for the text, while some even change text direction. That’s why app localization starts with development and design. Your interface should be localization friendly from the visual side as well.  Also, if any labels shouldn’t exceed a particular length, you should inform the translators in advance to work around the limitation.</p>
<h2>Create a Glossary</h2>
<p>If your app uses company-specific terminology, be sure to provide a glossary for the translators. A glossary will help keep the text consistent throughout the application and ensure better user experience.</p>
<h2>Language logic</h2>
<p>You will face the need to introduce additional logic to cover the grammatical differences of the target languages. Make sure this is correctly implemented in your application and provide instructions and guidelines to your translation partner to apply those rules in the translated version.</p>

<h2>Separate Text From Images</h2>
<p>If you want the project to run smoothly, you should get rid of text on images. You will save a lot of time and trouble! Instead, use filler images and overlap the text programmatically. Avoiding Images with text in another language shows users that you built the app for them.</p>

<p>We pick up the story again at the question of a breadth-first (Applicative) traversal of a rose tree <span data-cites="gibbons_breadthfirst_2015">(Gibbons <a href="#ref-gibbons_breadthfirst_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. In the last post, I finally came up with an implementation I was happy with:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Tree</span> a <span>=</span> a <span>:&amp;</span> [<span>Tree</span> a]</span>

<span id="cb1-6"><span>bftF ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f b) <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Tree</span> a] <span>-&gt;</span> f [<span>Tree</span> b]</span>

<span id="cb1-9">    f (x <span>:&amp;</span> xs) (q <span>:</span> qs) <span>=</span> liftA2 c (t x) q <span>:</span> <span>foldr</span> f (p qs) xs</span>
<span id="cb1-10">    </span>
<span id="cb1-11">    p []     <span>=</span> [<span>pure</span> ([]<span>:</span>)]</span>
<span id="cb1-12">    p (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (([]<span>:</span>)<span>.</span>) x <span>:</span> xs</span>

<span id="cb2-39">        , () <span>:&amp;</span> []]]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But it’s quite difficult to understand, and doesn’t lend much insight into what’s going on with the whole “breadth-first” notion. The technique the function uses also isn’t reusable.</p>
<p>A much nicer function uses the <code>Phases</code> Applicative <span data-cites="easterly_functions_2019">(Easterly <a href="#ref-easterly_functions_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>bft ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Tree</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb3-2">bft f <span>=</span> runPhases <span>.</span> go</span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">    go (x <span>:&amp;</span> xs) <span>=</span> liftA2 (<span>:&amp;</span>) (<span>Lift</span> (f x)) (later (<span>traverse</span> go xs))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But this function is quadratic.</p>
<p>So the task for this post today is to derive a type like the <code>Phases</code> type with a <code>later</code> operation, but which has the appropriate performance characteristics. At the end I’ll look into what the theoretical properties of this type are.</p>

<p>At its core, the <code>Phases</code> type is basically a free Applicative <span data-cites="capriotti_free_2014">(Capriotti and Kaposi <a href="#ref-capriotti_free_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. I’ll reimplement it here as a slightly different free Applicative (one that’s based on <code>liftA2</code> rather than <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>):</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Free</span> f a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">  <span>Pure</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Free</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb4-3">  <span>Lift</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Free</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Free</span> f c</span>
<span id="cb4-4">  </span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>lower ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Free</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb4-6">lower (<span>Pure</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>pure</span> x</span>
<span id="cb4-7">lower (<span>Lift</span> f x xs) <span>=</span> liftA2 f x (lower xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The key with the <code>Phases</code> type is to observe that there’s actually two possible implementations of <code>Applicative</code> for the <code>Free</code> type above: one which makes it the “correct” free applicative:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Applicative</span> (<span>Free</span> f) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">  <span>pure</span> <span>=</span> <span>Pure</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"></span>
<span id="cb5-4">  liftA2 c (<span>Pure</span> x) ys <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (c x) ys</span>
<span id="cb5-5">  liftA2 c (<span>Lift</span> f x xs) ys <span>=</span> <span>Lift</span> (\x (y,z) <span>-&gt;</span> c (f x y) z) x (liftA2 (,) xs ys)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then one which <em>zips</em> effects together:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Applicative</span> (<span>Free</span> f) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span>pure</span> <span>=</span> <span>Pure</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">  </span>
<span id="cb6-4">  liftA2 c (<span>Pure</span> x) ys <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (c x) ys</span>
<span id="cb6-5">  liftA2 c xs (<span>Pure</span> y) <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> c y) xs</span>
<span id="cb6-6">  liftA2 c (<span>Lift</span> f x xs) (<span>Lift</span> g y ys) <span>=</span> </span>
<span id="cb6-7">    <span>Lift</span> </span>
<span id="cb6-8">      (\(x,y) (xs,ys) <span>-&gt;</span> c (f x xs) (g y ys)) </span>
<span id="cb6-9">      (liftA2 (,) x y) </span>
<span id="cb6-10">      (liftA2 (,) xs ys)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This second instance makes the <code>Free</code> type into not a free Applicative at all: instead it’s some kind of Applicative transformer which we can use to reorder effects. Since effects are combined only when they’re at the same point in the list, we can use it to do our breadth-first traversal.</p>
<p>As an aside, from this perspective it’s clear that this is some kind of <code>FunList</code> <span data-cites="vanlaarhoven_nonregular_2009">(van Laarhoven <a href="#ref-vanlaarhoven_nonregular_2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>: this opens up a lot of interesting curiosities about the type, since that type in particular is quite well-studied.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’re able to do the <code>later</code> operation quite simply:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>later ::</span> <span>Free</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Free</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb7-2">later <span>=</span> <span>Lift</span> (<span>const</span> <span>id</span>) (<span>pure</span> ())</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The problem at the moment is that the Applicative instance has an <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(n)</annotation></semantics></math> <code>liftA2</code> implementation: this translates into an <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(n^2)</annotation></semantics></math> traversal overall.</p>
<p>If we were working in a more simple context of just enumerating the contents of the tree, we might at this point look to something like difference lists: these use the cayley transform on the list monoid to turn the append operation from <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(n)</annotation></semantics></math> to <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(n^2)</annotation></semantics></math>. It turns out that there is a similar cayley transformation for Applicative functors <span data-cites="rivas_notions_2014 rivas_monoids_2015">(Rivas and Jaskelioff <a href="#ref-rivas_notions_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>; Rivas, Jaskelioff, and Schrijvers <a href="#ref-rivas_monoids_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Day</span> f a <span>=</span> <span>Day</span> {<span> runDay ::</span> <span>∀</span> b<span>.</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f (a, b) }</span>
<span id="cb8-2"></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Functor</span> (<span>Day</span> f) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4">  <span>fmap</span> f xs <span>=</span> <span>Day</span> (<span>fmap</span> (first f) <span>.</span> runDay xs)</span>
<span id="cb8-5">  </span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Applicative</span> (<span>Day</span> f) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">  <span>pure</span> x <span>=</span> <span>Day</span> (<span>fmap</span> ((,) x))</span>
<span id="cb8-8">  liftA2 c xs ys <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb8-9">    <span>Day</span> (<span>fmap</span> (\(x,(y,z)) <span>-&gt;</span> (c x y, z)) <span>.</span> runDay xs <span>.</span> runDay ys)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And with this type we can implement our queue of applicative effects:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>type</span> <span>Queue</span> f <span>=</span> <span>Day</span> (<span>Free</span> f)</span>
<span id="cb9-2"></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><span>runQueue ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Queue</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb9-4">runQueue <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>fst</span> <span>.</span> lower <span>.</span> <span>flip</span> runDay (<span>Pure</span> ())</span>
<span id="cb9-5"></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>now ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Queue</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb9-7">now xs <span>=</span> <span>Day</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8">  <span>Pure</span> x      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lift</span> (,) xs (<span>Pure</span> x)</span>
<span id="cb9-9">  <span>Lift</span> f y ys <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lift</span> (\(x,y) z <span>-&gt;</span> (x, f y z)) (liftA2 (,) xs y) ys</span>
<span id="cb9-10"></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><span>later ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Queue</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Queue</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb9-12">later xs <span>=</span> <span>Day</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb9-13">  <span>Pure</span> x      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lift</span> (<span>const</span> <span>id</span>) (<span>pure</span> ()) (runDay xs (<span>Pure</span> x))</span>
<span id="cb9-14">  <span>Lift</span> f y ys <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Lift</span> (\x (y,z) <span>-&gt;</span> (y, f x z)) y (runDay xs ys)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As expected, this gives us the clean implementation of a breadth-first traversal with the right asymptotics (I think):</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>bft ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Tree</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb10-2">bft f <span>=</span> runQueue <span>.</span> go</span>
<span id="cb10-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4">    go (x <span>:&amp;</span> xs) <span>=</span> liftA2 (<span>:&amp;</span>) (now (f x)) (later (<span>traverse</span> go xs))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(it’s worth pointing out that we haven’t actually used the applicative instance on the free applicative at any point: we have inlined all of the “zipping” to make it absolutely clear that everything has stayed linear).</p>

<p>I have yet to really dive deep on any of the theory involved in this type, I just quickly wrote up this post when I realised I was able to use the cayley transform from the mentioned papers to implement the proper breadth-first traversal. It certainly seems worth looking at more!</p>

<p>Few years ago I did some <a href="https://hforsten.com/homemade-synthetic-aperture-radar.html">simple synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging
experiments</a> with the second version of my homemade
FMCW radar. Since then I made a much improved <a href="https://hforsten.com/third-version-of-homemade-6-ghz-fmcw-radar.html">third version of the
radar</a> but didn't do any SAR measurements due to the
amount of effort it would have required. I did have plans to do some SAR
experiments afterwards but it took until now to have enough time and
motivation.</p>
<p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is a way to synthesize very large antenna
array by moving single antenna on a known path. If there are no moving targets
in the scene then one radar taking many measurements along a path gives the same
result as one ridiculously large radar that is as long as the movement path.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/fmcw3-sar/xsar_imaging.png.pagespeed.ic.MP13OL2L7B.png" width="40%/"></p><p>SAR imaging of a single target. As the radar
    moves the measured distance follows a parabola.</p>
</div>

<p>If we move on a straight path while radar pointing 90 degrees from the direction
of the path measures a distance to the single target, we will find that the
measured distance follows a parabola. This follows directly from the Pythagorean
theorem. The SAR imaging problem is finding out the target position from the
measured distance data. Of course in a real scene we have multiple targets and
the solution isn't as simple as looking where the closest approach is as could
be done in the picture above.</p>

<p>There are few different algorithms for solving this problem, but the one I'm
going to use is called Omega-k algorithm. It is a fast imaging algorithm
utilizing FFT which also makes it efficient to calculate on GPU. The derivation
mostly follows <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7878107">a paper by Guo and
Dong</a>.</p>
<p>The radar I have is a frequency modulated constant wave (FMCW) radar. It
transmits a short frequency sweep. The transmitted waveform can be modeled as: </p>
<p>$$ s_t(\tau) = \exp(j 2 \pi f_c \tau + \pi \gamma \tau^2),\quad -T_s/2 &lt; \tau &lt; T_s/2 $$</p>
<p>, where <span>\(j&nbsp;= \sqrt{-1}\)</span>, <span>\(f_c =\)</span> RF carrier frequency, <span>\(\tau =\)</span> time variable,
<span>\(\gamma = B/T_s =\)</span> sweep bandwidth / sweep length <span>\(=\)</span> sweep rate.</p>
<p>The transmitted wave reflects off a target at some distance and is received after
time <span>\(t_d\)</span>. Ignoring the amplitude, the received wave is a time-delayed copy
of the transmitted signal: <span>\(s_r(\tau) = s_t(\tau - t_d)\)</span>. Signals from multiple
targets are summed.</p>
<p>The receiver mixes the received signal with the transmitted signal. This mixing
is called dechirping and it removes the high frequency RF component. The result
is a low frequency signal, usually some few kHz to MHz and is easy to digitize
with low-cost ADC. With the complex signals we take complex conjugate of the
transmitted signal to get the low-pass product and the resulting mixing product is:</p>
<p>$$ s_{\text{IF}}(\tau) = s_t(\tau - t_d) s_t^*(\tau) = \exp(-j 2 \pi f_c t_d
- j 2 \pi \gamma t_d \tau + j \pi \gamma \tau^2) $$</p>
<p>During SAR measurement the radar repeats this measurement while moving on
a straight path with a constant speed. The position of the radar on the path is:
<span>\(x = v \tau + x_n\)</span>, where <span>\(v\)</span> is speed of the radar platform and <span>\(x_n
= v n T_p\)</span>. <span>\(n\)</span> is the index for measurements and <span>\(T_p\)</span> is the transmit
repetition interval.</p>
<p>If the radar target is at position <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> the distance to the target can
be written as:</p>
<p>$$ R(x) = \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_0 - x)^2}&nbsp;$$</p>
<p>We set the y-coordinate of the path to be 0 and x position is limited to <span>\(-L/2
&lt; x &lt; L/2\)</span>, where <span>\(L\)</span> is length of the path.</p>
<p>Since electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light and radar signal needs
to travel to the target and back to the radar, we get expression
for received signal time delay <span>\(t_d = 2R(x)/c\)</span>, where <span>\(c\)</span> is the speed of light.</p>
<p>The recorded signal can be written as:</p>
<p>$$ s_{\text{IF}}(\tau, x) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + \gamma \tau) R(x)\right)
\exp\left(j \frac{4 \pi \gamma^2}{c^2} R^2(x)\right) $$</p>
<p>The last term in the above expression is called residual video phase term and
it's an undesirable by-product from dechirping operation. It should be removed
before further processing by multiplying by <span>\(\exp(-j \frac{4 \pi \gamma^2}{c^2}
R^2(x))\)</span>.  However this form is inconvenient because it depends on <span>\(R(x)\)</span>. Using
the fact that <span>\(R(x) = c t_d / 2\)</span> and that <span>\(t_d\)</span> can be expressed in terms of
frequency of the IF signal: <span>\(f = -2 \gamma R(x) / c = -\gamma t_d \Rightarrow
t_d = -\frac{f}{\gamma}\)</span> we can write the correction term as <span>\(\exp(-j \pi f^2
/ \gamma)\)</span>. This form can be applied easily to the Fourier transformed signal.</p>
<p>With RVP term removed the signal is:</p>
<p>$$ s(\tau, x_n) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + \gamma \tau) \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + v \tau)^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to have the signal in form <span>\(\exp(-j 2 \pi f_y y_0)\exp(-j
2\pi f_x x_0)\)</span>, then we could apply two dimensional inverse Fourier transform to
get a delta function centered at <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> focusing the image. Currently the
signal <span>\(s(\tau, x_n)\)</span> is not in this form and inverse Fourier transform doesn't
give anything interesting. We need to find some processing steps to apply to the
signal to get it to the required form so that inverse Fourier transform can be
applied. The reason to look specifically for this kind of form is that FFT can
be performed very efficiently.</p>
<p>As a first step, note that <span>\(\gamma\)</span> has units of Hz/s and <span>\(\tau\)</span> has units of s.
The product <span>\(\gamma \tau\)</span> has units of Hz so it's a frequency. This product is actually
instantenous modulation frequency of the sweep. We do substitution <span>\(\gamma
\tau \rightarrow f_\tau\)</span> to get rid of the time variable. <span>\(\tau\)</span> range was <span>\(-T/2
\ldots T/2\)</span> and the new range for <span>\(f_\tau\)</span> is <span>\(-B/2 \ldots B/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>$$ S(f_\tau, x_n) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + f_\tau) \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + \frac{v f_\tau}{\gamma} )^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Also instead of using frequency the math is cleaner and the implementation of
the algorithm is easier when using wavenumbers instead. We define range
wavenumber <span>\(K_r = K_{rc} + \Delta K_r\)</span>. <span>\(K_{rc} = \frac{4\pi f_c}{c}\)</span>, <span>\(\Delta
K_r = \frac{4\pi f_\tau}{c} = -\frac{2\pi B}{c} \ldots \frac{2\pi B}{c}\)</span>.</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, x_n) = \exp\left(-j K_r \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + \frac{v c \Delta K_r}{4 \pi \gamma} )^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Next step is to do Fourier transform in azimuth direction (direction of the
movement) to move also the <span>\(x_n\)</span> variable to frequency domain.</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, K_x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty S(K_r, x_n) \exp(-j K_x x_n)\, dx_n  = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(j\Phi(x_n))\, dx_n $$</p>
<p><span>\(K_x = 2\pi f_x\)</span> is wavenumber in the azimuth direction. This integral doesn't have
exact solution, but there is a method to calculate quite accurate approximation
using a method called principle of stationary phase (PSOP). Phase of the
function being integrated can be written as:</p>
<p>$$ \Phi(x_n) = -K_r \sqrt{y_0^2 + \left(x_n - x_0 + \frac{v c \Delta K_r}{4 \pi \gamma} \right)^2} - K_x x_n $$</p>
<p>If we plot the phase <span>\(\Phi(x_n)\)</span> for some realistic values we get a plot that
looks something like below:</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/fmcw3-sar/xphi_plot.png.pagespeed.ic.0z1VF8YpRH.png" width="40%/"></p><p>Phase and real part of the function being
    integrated.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one point where derivative of the phase is zero (stationary point) and
the function varies slowly, but away from that point the function is highly
oscillatory. As we integrate the function the oscillations far away from the
stationary point cancel out and mainly the area around the stationary point
contributes to the result of the integral.</p>
<p>We can expand the function around the stationary point <span>\(\frac{d}{dx_n}\Phi(x_n) \rvert_{x_n=x_n^\star} = 0\)</span>, as
<span>\(\Phi(x_n) = \Phi(x_n^\star) + 0 + \frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n - x_n^\star)^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging the Taylor expansion in to the integral we get:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{aligned}S(K_r, K_x) &amp;\approx \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(j\frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)(x_n-x_n^\star)^2\right)\, d x_n \\
&amp;= \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(j\frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)s^2\right)\, d s \\
&amp;= \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \sqrt{\frac{2\pi j}{\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)}} \end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Since <span>\(\Phi(x_n)\)</span> is purely real function, if <span>\(\mu\)</span> is sign of the
<span>\(\Phi(x_n^\star)\)</span>, then the square root term can be written as
<span>\(\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{|\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)|}} exp(j\pi \mu/4)\)</span>. The second
derivative contributes amplitude term and constant phase term, neither of them
which is important for focusing image which mainly depends on aligning the
phases. We have ignored the amplitude since beginning and it ends up being slowly
varying function so we will just approximate it away.</p>
<p>The stationary point of the function <span>\(\frac{d}{dx_n}\Phi(x_n)
\rvert_{x_n=x_n^\star} = 0\)</span> can be solved to be:</p>
<p>$$ x_n^\star = x_0 - \frac{K_x y_0}{\sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2}} - \frac{c \Delta K_r
v}{4\pi\gamma} $$</p>
<p>Plugging in the stationary point to the <span>\(S(K_r, K_x)\)</span> equation above we get the
solution of the integral:</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, K_x) \approx \exp\left(j(-y_0 \sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2} - K_x x_0 + \frac{c \Delta K_r K_x
v}{4\pi\gamma})\right) $$</p>
<p>The last term is phase offset caused by the movement of the radar during the
sweep. It can be removed by multiplying with exponential in the opposite phase.</p>
<p><span>\(x_0\)</span> term is already in the correct form as it is multiplied only by <span>\(K_x\)</span>, but
<span>\(y_0\)</span> term depends on both <span>\(K_r\)</span> and <span>\(K_x\)</span>. <span>\(K_r, K_x\)</span> dependence can be fixed
by making a substitution <span>\(\sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2} \rightarrow K_y\)</span>. This step is
called Stolt interpolation as it is implemented by interpolating the data to
a new grid.</p>
<p>After the Stolt interpolation the signal is in form:</p>
<p>$$ S(K_y, K_x) = \exp(j(-K_y y_0 - K_x x_0)) $$</p>
<p>Taking 2D inverse Fourier transform gives the focused image with delta function
centered at <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span>.</p>

<p>The Omega-k algorithm is mainly large FFTs and interpolation. Both can be
implemented well on GPU which requires large parallelism from the program. Well
written GPU implementation should be several times faster than CPU
implementation. For convenience I'll implement the algorithm using Tensorflow
library. Although it's …</p></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

<p>CyberNews researchers discovered suspicious backdoors in a Chinese made router sold under the name ‘Jetstream’. This router is part of Walmart’s new line of affordable Wi-Fi routers.</p>
<blockquote><p>This backdoor would allow an attacker the ability to remotely control not only the routers, but also any devices connected to that network.</p></blockquote>

<p>The researchers contacted Walmart to get a statement, and a Walmart spokesperson had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are looking into the issue to learn more. The item in question is currently out of stock and we do not have plans to replenish it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>CyberNews researchers also discovered that ‘Wavlink’ branded routers, often sold on Amazon or eBay, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contain similar backdoors</a>.</p>
<p>Worryingly, they also discovered that these <strong>backdoors are being actively exploited</strong>, and there have been attempts to add the routers to a botnet with malware that allows them to be used in large scale DDoS attacks, which have <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the past taken down major websites</a> such as Reddit, Netflix, CNN, GitHub, Twitter, AirBnb and more.</p>

<p><span>We are nothing but the values we carry. All through my life thus far, I tried to influence people around me with the virtues I value. Thanks to some good reading habits I had inculcated, and the fortune of being in good community of peers and mentors alike, I managed to have read some real good books. This post is about the 10 commands of egoless programming in Weinberg's book. I shall explain the commandments based on my experience here.</span></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><span>So very many decades ago, Gerald M. Weinberg authored&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2229333.Psychology_of_Computer_Programming"><u>The Psychology of Computer Programming</u></a>. In it, he listed <strong>The Ten Commandments of&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoless_programming"><strong><u>Egoless Programming</u></strong></a>, which remains relevant even today for us as not just programmers but as team-members.</span></p><p><span>Weinberg is regarded as a pioneer in taking a people-centric approach to computing, and his work endures as a good guide to intelligence, skill, teamwork, and problem-solving power of a developer. When they appear to inspire and instruct, we find that they can apply to just about every business area, and even to life itself.</span></p><p><span>Here are the 10 important lessons developers, project managers, and stakeholders would do well to keep in mind during the project lifecycle.</span></p><ol><li><p><span><strong>Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.</strong><br>Mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry, so find them early, before they make it into production, learn from them, and move on.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>You are not your code.</strong><br>The point of a review is to find problems. Don't take it personally when one is found. Remember&nbsp;<a href="https://olxpeople.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPETE/pages/940179552">my words</a>, “To err is only human, repeating it is what makes you either evil or insane”.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>No matter how much "karate" you know, someone else will always know more.</strong><br>Seek and accept input from others. You can learn new techniques if you just ask. Always remember, it is never too late to learn.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Don't rewrite code without consultation.</strong><br>It is always a good idea to pair-up and have conversations on the code that you are tempted to re-write because you think it is bad. Your risks are much lesser if the code is backed by Unit tests. The least you can do is get it code reviewed before pushing code to main-stream branch.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.</strong><br>Don’t be a bully. Seriously, just don’t be one. Grow up!</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>The only constant in the world is change.</strong><br>Things change, sometime for better and sometimes for worse. There are some things in your control which you can leverage to change things for better. Be the change that you wish for good. Also be willing to accept change for the overall good of the team.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</strong><br>Don't wield a title like a badge of "rightness."&nbsp;<span>If you want to be loved and respected in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge. It may or may not lead to authority, but sure leads to love and respect from others. </span></span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.</strong><br>Open culture is not being polite in the front and back-bitching in the back. Rise up, voice your concerns, be heard, and make your point of view by doing your homework, all with an intent to help and learn otherwise. You can’t accept defeat, if you carry the burden of your ego. </span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Don't be "the guy in the room".</strong><br>There are so many beer buddies, movie mates, cigarette companions, and what not, who can come together or fight fiercely on any non-professional topics by respecting each other; but definitely not discuss and debate openly, work related matters for team’s betterment. Just don’t be that guy in the room.  </span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.</strong><br>Pour your frustration on lifeless things instead of on emotional beings. Corollary, if someone were to show his frustrations on you instead of your work, be a little polite to him, discounting it as emotional down syndrome. I have been on both sides, and so will you sometime. Let us support one another and grow together.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Just to re-iterate, these commandments are still incredibly relevant. Put it to deliberate practice and with time they will bring out a better developer and co-worker in you.</span></p><p><span>You can get this book from <a href="https://amzn.to/3lZvXr9" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</span></p>

<p>Over the course of several months, John dealt with remediating a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, several times. A researcher was able to bypass blocking mechanisms, therefore John decided to dig in further to get to the root cause of the vulnerability.</p>
<p>The researcher used the following payload to bypass restrictions:</p>
<pre><code>http://0000.0000.0000.0000:&lt;redactedport#&gt;/&lt;redacted&gt;/&lt;redacted&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Security researchers know that using multiple zeroes is a classic way to bypass localhost blocking when abusing SSRF vulnerabilities. Additionally, it was noted that other variations of 0’s can be used within the 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 payloads. However, the fundamental issue was a result of localhost skewing, which made it clear to John that the blocking mechanism wasn’t accounting for the variations.</p>
<p>After talking to other colleagues, John got in touch with Harold Hunt who helped him identify the package responsible for the IP blocking mechanism, <strong>private-ip</strong>.</p>
<p>The code logic was utilizing simple Regular Expression, therefore not accounting for variations of localhost, and other private-ip ranges, as predicted. John and Harold realized that it would be exceedingly difficult to come up with simple regex to cover all of the possibilities, therefore John contacted Nick Sahler and Sick.Codes for their Software Engineering expertise.</p>

<p>The npm private-ip package has an average of 14,000 downloads weekly - even though the package is roughly four years old. Using the out-of-date version can result in continuous SSRF bypass vulnerabilities, and threat actors can intentionally extract sensitive information and escalate their privileges further. Be advised, <strong>Enterprises utilizing this package as a means of preventing SSRF or related vulnerabilities,</strong> <strong>should upgrade to the latest version immediately.</strong></p>

<p>The old code was evaluated further, this was the prevention mechanism being used in the index.js:</p>
<pre><code>/^(::f{4}:)?10\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})$/i.test(ip) ||
/^(::f{4}:)?192\\.168\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})$/i.test(ip) ||
/^(::f{4}:)?172\\.(1\[6-9\]|2\\d|30|31)\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})$/i.test(ip) ||
/^(::f{4}:)?127\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})$/i.test(ip) ||
/^(::f{4}:)?169\\.254\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})\\.(\[0-9\]{1,3})$/i.test(ip) ||
/^f\[cd\]\[0-9a-f\]{2}:/i.test(ip) ||
/^fe80:/i.test(ip) ||
/^::1$/.test(ip) ||
/^::$/.test(ip)  
</code></pre>
<p>There are already several issues within the regex. It’s not comprehensive enough to cover the localhost variations, nor many of the industry standard private IP ranges. Nick and Sick.Codes utilized netmask and rewrote the index.js:</p>
<pre><code>var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask
function netmaskCheck (params) {
let privateRanges = [
    '0.0.0.0/8',
    '10.0.0.0/8',
    '100.64.0.0/10',
    '127.0.0.0/8',
    '169.254.0.0/16',
    '172.16.0.0/12',
    '192.0.0.0/24',
    '192.0.0.0/29',
    '192.0.0.8/32',
    '192.0.0.9/32',
    '192.0.0.10/32',
    '192.0.0.170/32',
    '192.0.0.171/32',
    '192.0.2.0/24',
    '192.31.196.0/24',
    '192.52.193.0/24',
    '192.88.99.0/24',
    '192.168.0.0/16',
    '192.175.48.0/24',
    '198.18.0.0/15',
    '198.51.100.0/24',
    '203.0.113.0/24',
    '240.0.0.0/4',
    '255.255.255.255/32'
].map(b =&gt; new Netmask(b))
for (let r of privateRanges) {
    if (r.contains(params)) return true
  }
  return false
}  
</code></pre>
<p>Several other files were modified, but this key-function helped enable the private-ip package to account for the private-ip address ranges and variations, on the byte level. Hackers attempting to bypass SSRF vulnerabilities will now have an exceedingly difficult time because even payloads encoded into hexadecimal, etc, will be recognized as the IP address as if it were not encoded, triggering a conditional block.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. In some organizations, software developers can make buying decisions, either directly by using the company credit card or through their manager, who purchases based on a majority vote.</p>



<p>But in other organizations, the person buying the product is not the same as using it later on.<br>The buyer might be someone from the purchasing department or a C-Level executive.<br>In either case, have you tried talking to them in the same way you talk to developers about your product?<br>I did initially, and it wasn’t fruitful. A CTO doesn’t care too much about all the great features we provide.</p>



<p>First of all, a CTO wouldn’t directly use the product, but also, they have different metrics to determine success for themselves.<br>Metrics to determine success?<br>For instance, a developer might determine their success by the number of features delivered, the number of bugs fixed, or how many code reviews they performed.<br>On the other hand, a CTO might be concerned with the efficiency of the entire developer organization or how to save costs.<br>With these metrics in mind, can your product make an impact?<br>What are the benefits that enable cost savings and an increase in efficiency?</p>



<p>Now, how is that critical for sales conversations?<br>When you talk to developers in, let’s say, an initial discovery call, you discuss their use cases and see if you might be able to help them. It’s a technical conversation.<br>Then, you need to find out about the next steps and which ultimately makes the purchasing decision.<br>In case somebody else makes the purchasing decision, find out as much as you can about the process. Will there be a meeting? Who else is attending?<br>Can you talk to the decision-maker directly? For these discussions, you need to have your arguments and benefits at hand that matter <em>to them</em>. How can you save costs? How can you enable the team to be more efficient? What is your story?</p>



<p>Even if you can’t talk to the decision-maker directly, offer to meet with the developers to prep them for the decision-making meeting with your prepared arguments.<br>It’s common in today’s organizations that you have influencers and advocates in the organization who sell on your behalf. They like the company, the product and now put in the effort to get it purchased.<br>The better you can support them in these discussions, the higher the chance to close a deal.</p>



<p>Now, what are your benefits? Sit down and come up with the benefits necessary for the users. Then, do the same again for the buyer. What do they care about, and how can you make their lives easier?</p>

<p>As 2020 comes to a close and we look ahead to 2021, it’s time to evaluate what’s important for the IPFS Project to focus on next year – and we need your help! Get involved now and shape the IPFS project plan for the next year. Help us reflect on IPFS progress and status, how the wider ecosystem and internet has evolved over the past year, and chart a course for our work in 2021 that optimizes for the long term success of our mission.</p>

<p>This post can also be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap/blob/master/2021-IPFS-Project-Planning.md">IPFS Roadmap Github repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="potential-themes-for-2021">Potential Themes for 2021</h2>

<p>The IPFS team has started evaluating potential themes to guide the project in 2021. These themes are high level outcomes that would take a quarter or more and multiple initiatives to complete. See <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%222021+Theme+Proposal%22">the Roadmap repo</a> for a first pass at themes that resonate with the core IPFS Working Groups. The final north star for 2021 might be a combination of them or something that emerges from your input. As usual, this is a collaborative effort to assess what is important for the IPFS Project to achieve next year - work that we hope spans the efforts of many teams and projects - so we hope this process is a great feedback mechanism for many groups throughout the IPFS Ecosystem!</p>

<h2 id="proposal-process">Proposal Process</h2>

<p>We want to hear from you in the form of public Github issues. Issues should contain a potential theme that you think IPFS should tackle in 2021 - and why. Your theme proposals can be at any level of granularity — from general direction for the project, to specific features or tooling improvements, to ecosystem needs — everything is in scope. We want to hear what’s on your mind, what direction you want to take IPFS, and what your pain points are.</p>

<p>Aside from new theme proposals, we’d also very much appreciate comments on theme proposals, especially if there are additional important workstreams you’d like to see as part of that theme. Existing proposals for themes can be found <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%222021+Theme+Proposal%22">here</a>.</p>

<p>To suggest a theme proposal, please create a <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap/issues/new/choose">new 2021 Proposal issue</a> in this repo. The hope with using github issues is to allow for clarifying conversation in comments, help others build on your great ideas, and also be inspired to propose their own thoughts. You are welcome to submit more than one proposal!</p>

<![CDATA[Porting from Go to Raku – JJ Atria]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>In the past year or so, every time I’ve wanted to use hot-reloading<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for
some service I’m writing, I’ve reached for a tool called <a href="https://github.com/cespare/reflex"><code>reflex</code></a>. This
tool is not particularly original, but it is a reasonably good implementation,
and it ships as a standalone-binary, which makes it very easy to move about.</p>

<p>It is also written in a language I have some familiarity with, and one that
I’m trying to learn more about.</p>

<p>So of course I decided to implement my own.</p>

<p>The motivation was basically the same as <a href="https://pinguinorodriguez.cl/blog/introducing-http-tiny">the one that lead to
HTTP::Tiny</a>: a desire to understand how the code worked, and a
search for real-world problems to attempt to solve using Raku. I might write
more in a later post about the specifics of <a href="https://modules.raku.org/dist/App::Lorea:cpan:JJATRIA"><code>lorea</code></a>, but in this post I
want to focus on one aspect in particular, which I think showcases some of
the strengths of Raku… and some of its weaknesses.</p>

<h2 id="some-go-code-to-get-going">Some Go code to get going</h2>

<p>One of the nice features of <code>reflex</code> is that it batches file-system changes
to limit how often the command it needs to re-run gets executed. This is how
that feature is explained in <a href="https://github.com/cespare/reflex#batching">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of what reflex does is apply some heuristics to batch together
file changes. There are many reasons that files change on disk, and
these changes frequently come in large bursts. For instance, when you
save a file in your editor, it probably makes a tempfile and then
copies it over the target, leading to several different changes.
Reflex hides this from you by batching some changes together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple enough.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at <a href="https://github.com/cespare/reflex/blob/456b3718abbf1922cfbd498521c27851250f5496/reflex.go#L149-L186">the implementation</a>:</p>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>That block comes with a comment on top with these notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>batch</code> receives file notification events and batches them up. It’s a bit
tricky, but here’s what it accomplishes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When we initially get a message, wait a bit and batch messages before
trying to send anything. This is because the file events come in bursts.</li>
    <li>Once it’s time to send, don’t do it until the out channel is unblocked.
In the meantime, keep batching. When we’ve sent off all the batched
messages, go back to the beginning.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When I came across this piece of code, I had to re-read it several times, and
cross-reference that to the comment, and read through a couple of pages of
documentation before I could say I understood it. And now, to write this post,
I had to spend a good couple of minutes more staring at it before I could
remember how it worked.</p>

<p>In short, this is waiting on file-system changes to come in from a <code>channel</code>,
and it adds them to a backlog as they come in. It continues to do this until
there is a break between the incoming changes of at least 300 milliseconds,
and it then processes them.</p>

<p>The key here is the interaction between the <code>time.Timer</code> to keep track of
that time window, and the incoming and outgoing channels, which in Go are
blocking. The nested loops are there to make it so that, if an event comes
in while some other part of the system is running, it will also get
processed.</p>

<h2 id="porting-it-to-raku">Porting it to Raku</h2>

<p>As it turns out, porting code from Go to Raku is normally quite painless.
Like Go, Raku has superb support for asynchronous programming, and helper
classes like channels are built-in.</p>

<p>However, when it came to porting this bit of code I ran into a bit of a
complication: Raku has no equivalent to <code>time.Timer</code>.</p>

<p>For this particular case, the Go timer was being used to schedule an
events that would trigger in the future, unless it was re-scheduled to
happen further in the future via the <code>timer.Reset</code> call.</p>

<p>Now, while Raku comes with classes to represent <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Instant">moments in time</a>, as
well as <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Promise">events in the future</a>, these are not particularly well suited
for this case. For one, even if you can schedule an event in the future
(eg. with <code>Promise.new: $delay</code>) this promise <em>will take place</em>. Even if
you are not paying attention to it, any code you schedule will run.</p>

<p>While it does look like there is some intention of implementing cancellations
for Promises in the future, we’re not there yet. So we’ve got to make do with
what we have.</p>

<p>Luckily, Raku is a language that is built on the notion that you should have
enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot, and that it does. Enter
<a href="https://modules.raku.org/dist/Timer::Breakable:cpan:SCIMON">Timer::Breakable</a>, which implements something alike to breakable promises,
and my very own <a href="https://modules.raku.org/dist/Timer::Stopwatch:cpan:JJATRIA">Timer::Stopwatch</a>, which uses them to implement basically
the same idea as the Go timer.</p>

<h2 id="the-resulting-code">The resulting code</h2>

<p>With that set aside, let’s look at how that Go code compares to <a href="https://gitlab.com/jjatria/lorea/-/blob/a01e6ea0293fae79108bc912ac09e37757a12931/lib/App/Lorea/Command.rakumod#L95-109">the equivalent
code in Raku</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>method run ( --&gt; Promise ) {
    use Timer::Stopwatch;
    my Timer::Stopwatch $timer .= new;

    start react {
        whenever $!supply {
            $timer.reset: 0.3;
            $!queue.add: .path;
        }
        whenever $timer { start self!process-queue }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The beauty here is that, unlike in Go, I’m using a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Supply">Supply</a> which offers the
same asynchronous guarantees as a channel with the benefit that reading and
writing from it does not block, so the nested loops to make sure that we catch
events that happen while we are waiting are gone.</p>

<h2 id="trade-offs-trade-offs">Trade-offs, trade-offs</h2>

<p>It’s possible that there are some subtle differences between the two versions
of this code, but they are functionally identical, and I was happy to get rid
of the added complexity to get code that I can understand at a glance.</p>

<p>It did highlight in my eyes one of the limitations in Raku, however: that the
standard library, while huge in some respects, still lacks tools to do some of
the things that you might argue are pretty basic.</p>

<p>Luckily, this kind of thing can be remedied by libraries and modules that
extend the language, like the ones shown here. And as more of these real-world
cases are explored, one can hope that cases like these, where we lack the
tools to get the job done, become a rarity.</p>

<p>I’ll be happy to continue to contribute to that end.</p>

Ask a manager</h4><p>Approval is loose and informal. PMs and EMs briefly mention it to their managers over email or their regular check-in.</p><p>Managers won’t require much justification for approval. Why? Its an immaterial amount of money and they trust their employees’ judgment.</p><h4>2. Find a credit card</h4><p>With very few exceptions, PMs and EMs (at the levels I’m targeting) don’t have company credit cards. So how do they pay after getting approval?</p><h5>Pay with personal credit card</h5><p>This is a common practice for team meals, social events, and one-off software purchases. A senior team member will pay with a personal card and file an expense report.</p><p>But people are more hesitant to pay for a <em><strong>recurring</strong></em> team subscription with a personal card.</p><h5>Find a company credit card</h5><p>This varies from company to company, but the most common places people go are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Finance</strong> (manages budgets)</p></li><li><p><strong>IT</strong> (manages access to company subscriptions)</p></li><li><p><strong>Lowest person above them in the org chart with a company card</strong> (usually a Director or VP, depending on company size)</p></li></ol><h2>😁 Why my strategy will work</h2><h5>✅  Loose approval process</h5><p>I mentioned this before, but it’s worth restating. <strong>This means that the PM or EM using <a href="https://www.hellohailey.io/">HelloHailey</a> is the primary decision maker.</strong></p><p>No bureaucracy. No long, complex sales cycles.</p><p><strong>I just need to build a great product.</strong></p><h5>✅  Fits into an existing budget</h5><p>It’s my hypothesis that teams will pay for HelloHailey using their team “social” budgets. These budgets cover expenses like meals, games, or team events.</p><h5>✅  Takes a small percentage of that budget</h5><p>Team social budgets range from $10-$100 / person / month, with a median somewhere in the middle.</p><p>With a price of $2-$3 / person / month, HelloHailey would eat up only 5% of that budget on average.</p><h5>✅  Social budgets have been underutilized with sudden shift to remote work</h5><p>Half the people I talked to haven’t used their social budgets at all since being forced into remote work.</p><p>Most of the other half has used it sparingly for virtual team events.</p><h2>😢 Why it might not work</h2><p>Until companies <em>actually</em> start paying me, my strategy will be full of uncertainty.</p><p>Here are some ways it might fail:</p><h5>💩  Doesn’t fit into an existing budget</h5><p>Maybe companies don’t think it’s appropriate to pull from team social budgets for this kind of purchase.</p><p>If it doesn’t fit nicely into <em>any</em> existing category, it’ll be much harder for companies to buy it.</p><h5>💩  Hard to budget for a product with expanding price</h5><p><a href="https://www.hellohailey.io/">HelloHailey</a> will get more expensive as more users and teams are added within a company. </p><h5>💩  <strong>What happens when a product purchased with Team A’s social budget adds users from Team B and gets more expensive? </strong></h5><p>I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ (<em>Do you? <a href="https://twitter.com/AnotherTimJones">Share your wisdom and help me out</a> </em>🙂 ).</p><p>But I’m not the first person to face this problem. There are precedents in place and I’m confident I’ll figure it out.</p><h5>💩  Approval process is more difficult than expected</h5><p>The people I interviewed could be outliers. Maybe a typical manager requires more convincing to approve this kind of purchase.</p><h2>What about expanding?</h2><p>I now feel confident about landing. <strong>So how will I expand?</strong></p><p>I have some ideas for how I can build growth mechanisms into a product like this.</p><p>But if I’m being honest, I’m not sure yet 🤷‍♂️. And I’m OK with that.</p><p><strong>With a successful “land” strategy, and low to moderate expansion revenue, I can build a great business.</strong></p><p>Intra-company virality would be a must if I wanted to become a VC-backed rocket ship.</p><p><strong>But that’s not my goal.</strong></p><p><strong>I want to build a small, profitable company that solves a problem I’m passionate about.</strong></p><p>I can sell to unicorns. But I don’t want to <em>become</em> one.</p><h2>What did I get wrong?</h2><p>I learned a lot this week, but I’ve never done this before. </p><p><strong>Do you have SaaS sales experience?</strong></p><p>Don’t pull your punches! Help me out on my Twitter thread:</p><p>Don’t have any tips for me? <strong>Maybe you could help me out with a like or a retweet.</strong></p><p><strong>As a solopreneur with no funding or income, I’ll take all the help I can get 😁</strong></p><h2>🤔 Reducing uncertainty one week at a time</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:248,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:490,&quot;bytes&quot;:29061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:184,&quot;width&quot;:478,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:23531,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I’m finally feeling confident about my go-to-market strategy.

<p>Here we go again. Just when you figured out what all these weird abbreviations (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) are, one more pops up on the horizon. Weren’t you safe enough already? Weren’t the spoofers, seeing your robust DNS records, quietly running away? Not all of them. The bad news is that you need to become familiar with the new kids on the block –&nbsp; BIMI records. Good news – we’ve got them covered for you. Read on!<br></p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_BIMI_Record">What is a BIMI Record?</span></h2>



<p>BIMI stands for <strong>Brand Indicator for Message Identification</strong>. It’s a new approach that aims to prevent spoofing attempts but also increases the credibility of email senders. When fully implemented, hackers will have a very hard time trying to impersonate brands in emails, and maybe in a lot of other places too.<br></p>



<p><strong>A BIMI record is a DNS TXT record indicating what a brand’s logo is</strong>. When properly certified and authenticated, brands will be able to display their logo next to each message in an inbox, just like in the example below.<br></p>

They’ll also learn to recognize the brand they know and like, coming with obvious benefits for the companies. We will cover more about that later.<br></p>



<p>BIMI email authentication is developed as an open standard and it is possible that not only email clients will adopt it. Among the most likely candidates, messaging and social media apps are mentioned. Companies present there could also benefit from additional security. The platforms will probably be eager to get verified accounts on board. BIMI records could make a lot of difference.<br></p>



<p>We’ll see how it all plays out. At the time of writing (Dec. 2019), BIMI is in a pilot stage with Verizon Media Group (Yahoo!, AOL). Google recently also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-joins-authindicators-working-group-and-commits-to-bimi-pilot-300890074.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">announced that they will be trialing BIMI in 2020.</a> If everything works out as expected, we can see BIMI records being adopted more in the coming years.<br></p>



<h2><span id="What_are_the_requirements_to_join_the_BIMI_club">What are the requirements to join the BIMI club?</span></h2>



<p>For BIMI to work, several conditions need to be met:</p>



<ul><li>The sender’s domain needs to be DMARC-authenticated, with either ‘reject’ or ‘quarantine’ policy set up</li><li>The domain’s owner needs to obtain the right certification</li><li>A good sending history needs to be built</li></ul><p>Let’s discuss these conditions one-by-one.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Be_DMARC-certified">Be DMARC-certified</span></h3>



<p>We already discussed DMARC on our blog, but if you wish to read more about it, check out our <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dmarc-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">DMARC Explained</a> article, along with our tips on <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dmarc-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">how to set up DMARC record</a>.<br></p>



<p>Long story short, DMARC is an authentication method that works on top of SPF and/or DKIM.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/spf-records-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SPF</a> is used to specify which IP addresses are allowed to send emails on behalf of a given domain. <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dkim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">DKIM</a>, on the other hand, allows incoming servers to verify the headers and body of a message, so that they look just like they did when they were leaving the sender’s inbox.</p>



<p>DMARC runs either check (or both) and performs a separate domain alignment test for the methods used. Finally, a policy assigned with DMARC can suggest an incoming server if emails that fail a test should be:</p>



<ul><li>Reject -&gt; discarded and not delivered to the recipient’s inbox</li><li>Quarantine -&gt; sent to the spam folder</li><li>None -&gt; treated as though no check was made (good for testing)</li></ul><p>As we mentioned earlier, to qualify for BIMI, the policy needs to be set to either ‘quarantine’ or ‘reject’. Of course, the DMARC record needs to be properly configured.<br></p>



<p>DMARC doesn’t require both DKIM and SPF to be set up (though it’s a smart thing to do). For the BIMI record to have any effect, either of these methods should be in place, along with DMARC, of course. A check will be performed every time a message is due to be delivered, so it’s worth triple-checking if everything is intact.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Obtain_a_certification">Obtain a certification</span></h3>



<p>To add an additional layer of security, bodies governing BIMI, referred to as Mark Verifying Authorities (MVA), will ask for additional proof of domain ownership.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>To get in, you’ll need to obtain an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">EV (Extended Validation) certificate</a> and meet several additional requirements:</p>



<ul><li>Prove the ownership or the right to use a registered trademark</li><li>Have this trademark registered in a competent jurisdiction</li><li>Make sure the logo from the BIMI record matches the trademark</li><li>Assure the owner of a trademark is also a registrant of a given domain name (alternative, those using a trademark under a license must be registered as licensees of a domain)</li></ul><p>Only if all of these conditions are met, the MVA will proceed to issue a respective certification.<br></p>



<p>Keep in mind that these rules may change at any point. CNN was the first company to obtain a certificate from MVA and <a href="https://martechtoday.com/cnn-com-receives-first-verified-mark-certificate-in-preparation-for-bimi-email-standard-236255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">it happened only in October 2019</a>. Before the program is rolled out to the public, the rules will likely be re-evaluated a number of times and some tweaks might be introduced. We’ll do our best to update this article if any of these happen.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Maintain_a_good_sending_history">Maintain a good sending history</span></h3>



<p>The last requirement is rather vague, but is important to keep in mind. In order to qualify for BIMI, you’ll need to have a good sending reputation, both for your domain and IP address.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means having a healthy, engaged list of subscribers. Of course, you should avoid <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/soft-vs-hard-bounce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">email bounces</a> and spam reports, but the fact that your emails are regularly opened by the recipients will also play a significant role.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>You also will need to have a track record of sending a significant volume of emails. Smaller senders may also be granted access to BIMI at some point but for now, only bigger brands will have a shot.</p>

Unsubscribe anytime.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>



<h2><span id="How_to_implement_BIMI_records">How to implement BIMI records?</span></h2>



<p>Once you meet all the requirements and obtain respective certifications, you can go on and add a proper record to your Domain Name System (DNS).<br></p>



<p>Then, you’ll need to upload your logo, necessarily in SVG format to a public HTTPS address. It’s recommended that it’s square-shaped and transparent. You may also want to avoid any unnecessary text as the logo displayed will be really small, making reading nearly impossible.<br></p>



<p>Finally, you will add a TXT record for <em>default._bimi.DomainAddress</em> in the following format: </p>



<pre><code>v=BIMI1; l=logoURL;</code></pre>



<p>For example, for Mailtrap it could be:</p>



<pre><code>v=BIMI1; l=https://www.mailtrap.io/logo123.svg;</code></pre>



<p>(it’s not really a valid address but if you wish to use our logo, let us know!)<br></p>



<p>That’s all. If you’re approved into the program and everything was configured properly, you should see the first effects within a few days.<br></p>



<h2><span id="Where_can_BIMI_authentication_make_a_difference">Where can BIMI authentication make a difference?</span></h2>



<p>When talking about BIMI authentication and its impact, the first thing that comes up is email security. After all, that’s precisely what BIMI record was introduced for. We also can’t underestimate the marketing impact it can have on brands. Let’s talk about these two aspects.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Security_impact">Security impact</span></h3>



<p>While DKIM and SPF help prevent spoofing, skillful fraudsters can bypass these measures, especially if only one of them is set up. DMARC is much more difficult, as domain alignment is also checked. Chances are someone will pass through.<br></p>



<p>That’s when BIMI comes very handy. Most users don’t check email addresses of the senders and email clients don’t display them right away. Instead, all users see is the display name of a sender, sometimes with company initials.<br></p>



<p>This can be easily spoofed. <strong>When a BIMI record is in place, a brand’s missing logo may raise a yellow flag </strong>for those used to seeing the branding displayed for each email.<br></p>



<p>Popularizing BIMI will also directly <strong>impact the adoption rate of DMARC</strong>. Even after several years since the release, most companies still don’t use this technology and, according to <a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2018-q4-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Agari’s research</a>, only 8% of Fortune 500 companies have ‘reject’ or ‘quarantine’ policies in place. All the others are vulnerable to attacks, most of which can be easily prevented with the more sophisticated tools.<br></p>



<p>It’s in the best interest of both users and email service providers to drive the adoption of DMARC. BIMI has a chance to finally move the numbers in the right direction.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Marketing_impact">Marketing impact</span></h3>



<p>BIMI implementation can have a major impact on marketing efforts. Since BIMI is and will be free to participate in, brands will get <strong>free exposure with almost no effort</strong>. Users will learn to recognize their logos right on the spot.<br></p>



<p>Emails signed with logos will also <strong>build users’ trust</strong>, especially if the content that follows is valuable. They will certainly feel safer opening emails from familiar sources.<br></p>



<p>BIMI will likely expand at some point to other forms of online communication. Those that participate will be able to continuously develop brand awareness and quickly gain recognition.<br></p>



<p>Since the BIMI logo for an email is fetched from a DNS every time a message is delivered, <strong>rebranding will also run smoother than it usually does</strong>. All it will take is updating an SVG file in the domain’s DNS and changes will be applied with the next email delivered.<br></p>



<h2><span id="Wrapping_up">Wrapping up</span></h2>



<p>All of this sounds really exciting and we’ll be watching closely how this all evolves. Many companies will surely take advantage of this opportunity and once the pilots wrap up, many more will follow their steps.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Chances are that a few years from now, we’ll be looking suspiciously at emails coming in without company logos. Or who knows, maybe a completely different approach will take over by then and change the way we think about email authentication.<br></p>



<p>Whether you’re eligible for the program or not, you likely have a vital interest in making your emails better, and rightly so.

<p>Hell, you'd be surprised at how many people buy games with a moderate length and never finish them. On PC over 50 percent of the people who bought the latest Wolfenstein, a game you can beat in under 15 hours, never earned the achievement for finishing the story. Only 31 percent of Dishonored players on the PC beat the game. People think game length is mandatory, but even shorter games aren't finished by the majority of players.

<p>Especially if you're starting out, try to do small projects and don't worry too much about polishing them, don't worry about shipping the perfect game, embrace the messiness of getting into games for the first time, embrace not knowing what you're doing exactly yet.

<p>Small-scale works are often derided for feeling embryonic or unfinished, throwaway motifs or fledgling ideas that the artist failed to integrate into a sufficiently ambitious whole. Game designer Jake Elliott, who drew the title of his Ruins from Schumann’s appraisal of Chopin’s preludes, defended their proportion in an interview: “Maybe [Chopin] felt like they were complete objects, but there wasn’t a vocabulary for talking about pieces of music that were short at the time. Their length is what drew me … there is a lot that’s unspoken.” Having conventionally privileged length, magnitude, and formal unity, games too have left critics bereft of a clear rubric for evaluating intentionally abbreviated, serialized, even disorderly exercises in interactive design.<br><strong>— Peter Lido: Undertale, one year later</strong><br><a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/undertale-one-year-later/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://killscreen.com/articles/undertale-one-year-later/</a></p>

<p>The final idea that we brought over as gamers, the final idea that we had to let go of, was that a longer game makes a better game. We felt that the sense of completion and catharsis that you get when you watch our ending was so critical to the experience, that we decided that we had to help as many people as possible to complete Monument Valley. And that was more important than making the game longer or more difficult.<br><strong>— Ken Wong: Games Without Gamers (#DICE2014 Europe)</strong><br><a href="http://youtu.be/YdSClYHDow0?t=13m37s" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/YdSClYHDow0?t=13m37s</a></p>

<p>I value games being short, it makes them easier to fit into life, they get to the point sooner, it's possible to play them more times, trying out different possibilities, there's a clearer connection between decisions and outcome.<br><strong>— Michael Brough: imbroglio notes 6 - meditation</strong><br><a href="http://mightyvision.blogspot.de/2016/08/imbroglio-notes-6-meditation.html?m=1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mightyvision.blogspot.de/2016/08/imbroglio-notes-6-meditation.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>Small games must be protected from their own defenders!! They must be defended against a rhetoric of convenience, as if fitting helpfully into the meagre free time allotted us by rentiers was something to be proud of rather than something to grind against - they must be defended against the meagre virtues of "minimalism", parsimony, elegance, the values of those with enough cultural cachet that they can afford to speak softly, and which hold the same relation to an actual human economy of wants and needs as does a millionaire who doesn't tip.<br><strong>— thecathamites: Small Game Manifesto (part of&nbsp;Buttertown, 10 manifestos for groups of no people)</strong><br><a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/buttertown">https://thecatamites.itch.io/buttertown</a></p>

<p>Most human interaction is a combination of canned responses. </p>



<p>Does anyone enjoy small talk? Are there people who look forward to talking about the weather and asking about each other’s weekend plans? Why is that the default? </p>



<p>Everyone appreciates an authentic moment. A chance to really see another person…does it get any better than that? So why is it so hard to be authentic? Why does society expect us to waste so many words talking on-script? </p>



<p>We appreciate authenticity, but we’re scared to show it ourselves. How can we break past this cognitive dissonance?</p>



<p>A lot of my lifelong incorrect <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/27/am-i-an-extrovert-or-an-introvert/">belief that I was an introvert</a> boils down to the fact that I hate small talk. I suck at it, first of all. And it’s boring. I assumed that my hatred of small talk meant that I was an introvert. It didn’t occur to me until recently that small talk is not required.</p>



<p>So lately, I’ve been experimenting with skipping past small talk and diving right into big talk. A few examples:</p>



<ul><li>In a casual work chat, after saying hi, I skipped the next 10 minutes of canned small talk. I jumped straight into a tough question about how he has stayed sane in the same role (CEO) for 20 years, with no boss and no growth path. He rolled with it without missing a beat. We went deep for 30 minutes on what it means to have a boss and how there are different types of growth. It was amazing.</li><li>A neighbor and I ended up at the same spot at the same time. I knew that she was taking a break from her teaching job during the pandemic. So after saying hi, I asked her if she’s been missing teaching and the meaning that brings to her days. She lit up and I got to know her in a way that 7+ years of neighborly chit chat has never allowed.</li><li>A relative was at our house a last week. Usually, we’d chat for only a couple minutes about surface level “how’s work going?” type stuff. This time, I asked him why he has stayed with the same company for 40 years and if he’s ever wanted to leave. He was so excited to tell me about his career and why he’s avoided managerial roles and why he’s considering leaving now after all this time. This is a guy I’ve seen weekly for 15 years, and we had never made it past the canned interactions until now. </li></ul>



<p>Powerful things are happening in my life when I go off-script. I’m finally seeing people authentically that I’ve “known” for years. </p>



<p>I wish I had realized decades ago that small talk is not only optional, but toxic. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content"><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p><img src="https://alessandrocuzzocrea.com/how-i-made-a-ray-tracer/ray-tracer-final-render.jpg" alt="Ray tracer final render" width="1440" height="810" loading="lazy">
</p>

<p>Starting this year, I decided to dedicate some of my spare time to a few personal projects I never got around to actually doing due to various circumstances.</p>
<p>The goal of this particular project is to be able to create a simple ray tracer software tool that will be able to produce some cool images.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">Ray tracing</a> is a technique used to generate a two-dimensional image from a tri-dimensional model, and a ray tracer is a piece of software that performs ray-tracing calculations.</p>
<p>Ray tracing as a whole is getting more and more popular these days, as consumer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card">graphics cards</a> have gained the ability to do real-time ray tracing to increase image quality.</p>
<p>I’m going to present to you the process that brought me from zero to creating a ray tracer completely from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="personal-projects">Personal Projects</h2>
<p>The idea for this project actually came to me last year.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend who at that time was making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)">PS1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">emulator</a>.
We were talking about cool stuff like implementing a graphical pipeline in software (basically rendering an image without asking for any help from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a>).</p>
<p>That discussion reminded me of the time I made a ray tracer back in the day (I bet it’s still on my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4">iMac G4</a> hard drive).
I remember it was pretty crazy but I never got around to experimenting more with it.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool, I thought, to make another ray tracer as a personal project?</p>
<p>I went on and started coding on a whim.
Unfortunately, I was busy with other matters so I had to stop working on the project after a few commits.</p>
<p>Almost a whole year passed and the project was still lingering on my <a href="https://github.com/alessandrocuzzocrea">GitHub account</a> with only a few commits to it, so I decided to give it another chance.</p>
<p>This time, I’m going to proceed in a more structured fashion.
I find that I’m more likely to abandon a project if I jump into it without planning first.</p>
<p>Also, to make this a more effective learning experience, I’m going to tackle this project from first principle, meaning I have to study and fully comprehend the theory underlying ray tracing.</p>
<p>I’m reserving four months (from June to September) to bring the project to a conclusion.
Four months should be plenty of time to explore the subject while still short enough to avoid procrastinating.</p>
<h2 id="before-starting-out">Before Starting Out</h2>
<p>There are tons of tutorials and books out there on how to build a ray tracer, but in the past, I sometimes tried using resources like those <em>paint by numbers</em>-style books because they usually skip explaining the math and go straight to the code.
However, if you don’t understand what makes the ray tracer tick, you’re basically just copy-pasting the code without fully grasping it.
I could have used those as a reference, but since I already wrote a ray tracer a couple of years ago, I wanted to go more in-depth this time.</p>
<p>I would start from the math behind it.</p>
<p>I remember studying linear algebra when I was first starting out in computer graphics (mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-function">fixed-function pipeline</a>) ages ago, so naturally, I thought that was a good starting point.
I just needed to give myself a good refresher on the subject.</p>
<p>Searching online, I found this awesome free textbook called – yes, you guessed it – <a href="https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/">Linear Algebra</a> by <a href="https://hefferon.net/">Jim Hefferon</a>, Professor of Mathematics at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Michael%27s_College">Saint Michael’s College</a>.
The textbook is free to download.
Also available on the website is the LaTeX source, solutions to all the exercises, classroom slides, and a series of video lectures.</p>
<p>The second book I used is called <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YPblYyLqBM4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn:9780122861604&amp;pg=PP1&amp;redir_esc=y">An Introduction to Ray Tracing</a>.
It’s a classic book on the subject and while a lot of the techniques contained in it are kinda outdated, they’re still fundamental to understand the basics of ray tracing.
I bought this book in physical form ages ago and I remember it was really easy to follow and understand.
This book is likewise <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/An-Introduction-to-Ray-Tracing-The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Computer-Graphics-.pdf">available for free</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-application">The Application</h2>
<p>For learning projects like this, I’m always keen to make something that will be able to run in a web browser instead of a native application – the reason being that if the project runs in the browser, there’s less friction when I want to share or show it to somebody like a prospective employer.</p>
<p>Unless a side-project requires a specific feature that only a native app can have access to, I always try to settle for a web app.
The only problem is that any modern web project usually requires you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node.js</a> ecosystem.
While I don’t mind Node, I’m not the biggest fan of JavaScript.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s a fine programming language, but I’m personally more productive using languages that support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking">static type checking</a>.</p>
<p>And here’s where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a> comes to the rescue!
TypeScript is a programming language that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler">transpiles</a> to JavaScript.
TypeScript was developed to get around JavaScript’s shortcomings by adding support for optional static typing, which is why I chose it for this project.</p>
<h2 id="studying-linear-algebra">Studying <em>Linear Algebra</em></h2>
<p>Linear algebra is a broad subject.</p>
<p>I ended up studying the whole book, learning a lot of interesting topics that I would have never come across if I was only looking up at the math needed for ray tracing.
The book also presents some linear algebra real-world applications at the end of every chapter.
It really helps ground what you’re studying into reality.</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this book.
Working out proofs and exercises was more fun than I remembered from back in school.</p>
<h2 id="studying-an-introduction-to-ray-tracing">Studying <em>An Introduction to Ray Tracing</em></h2>
<p>I started studying <em>An Introduction to Ray Tracing</em> immediately after I finished <em>Linear Algebra</em>.</p>
<p>The book opens with a comprehensive introduction to ray tracing.</p>
<p>Various illustrations accompany the introduction to help the reader visualize the process.
Ray tracing is a visual matter, so having it explained in both text and visual form is great.
I found myself relying more on those rather than the written explanations.</p>
<p>After the introduction, we enter one of the most important chapters of the book.
Appropriately titled <em>Essential Ray Tracing Algorithms</em>, the chapter discuss the fundamental operation of calculating where our rays will intersect with the objects of our scenes, which, if you think about it, is what classic ray tracing is all about.</p>
<h2 id="taking-notes">Taking Notes</h2>
<p>I did all my writing on paper.</p>
<p>Writing on paper really helps me concentrate.
There’s just less friction that way.
With the computer, the next distraction is always only a new tab away.
I also feel that when I write stuff down on paper, I have an easier time recalling information later.</p>
<p>I remember reading some research that showed that writing by hand helps people remember better and learn more efficiently.
The brain supposedly gets more stimulated and less distracted when writing with a pen/pencil rather than just typing on a keyboard.
This helps to form long-term memory.</p>
<p>I also find that I tend to review my paper notes more over digital ones.
Having something physical on your desk always there reminding you of your progress is better than having something in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file">text file</a> that you write once and then forget about.
I know this because, over the years, I’ve accumulated tons of now-forgotten memos all over the place, spanning a multitude of devices and cloud services.</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-what-ive-learned">Reviewing What I’ve Learned</h2>
<p>As I was finishing each chapter, I wrote down all the interesting explanations and definitions on flashcards.
I know that flashcards and SRS are a controversial topic in the learning community, but I’ve been using those tools for a long time now and they’ve always served me well.
Yes, creating and reviewing the cards is extremely time-consuming, but I think it’s worth the time investment.
I find it especially helpful for memorizing definitions.</p>
<p>Repetition is key to make something stick.</p>
<p>Repetition is a simple way to keep knowledge fresh.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced repetition</a> software uses repetition to help you review your cards.
The more you get a card’s answer right, the less frequently the card is shown.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)">Anki</a> is my SRS of choice.
I’ve been using it for a long time now and have accumulated quite a few  flashcards on my Anki account.
The software is quite straightforward to use.
For example, I have cards that ask me to demonstrate a theorem.
After I finish my answer (which I write rigorously by hand because, as I said before, doing so helps me jog my memory), I compare my answer against the one written on the back of the card.
Then it’s time to rate my answer.
I can choose between <em>Easy</em>, <em>Good</em>, or <em>Again</em> depending on how difficult answering the card was.
When you select <em>Again</em>, Anki will flag your answer as incorrect and show you those cards more frequently to help you memorize them.</p>
<h2 id="the-ray-tracing-algorithm">The Ray Tracing Algorithm</h2>
<p>This is the heart of any ray tracer – the sweet intersection between math and code that makes everything tick.</p>
<p>When people explain ray tracing, they usually make an analogy about how real-world cameras work.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(optics)">Rays of light</a> from the environment enter the camera from the lens and hit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor">sensor</a> (or a piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film">film</a> in the case of an analog one) in the back of the camera.
The sensor then captures the color of the light and the camera produces the final image file.</p>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://alessandrocuzzocrea.com/how-i-made-a-ray-tracer/a-ray-of-light-reflecting-off-an-object-and-reaching-the-sensor-inside-the-camera.jpg" alt="A ray of light reflecting off an object and reaching the sensor inside the camera" width="1440" height="810" loading="lazy">


    <figcaption>A ray of light reflecting off an object and reaching the sensor inside the camera</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ray tracing works almost the same way as a real-life camera, only instead of a sensor, we have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_plane">image plane</a>.</p>
<p>The image plane of a ray tracer works a lot like the sensor of a camera.
Basically, ray tracers create images by determining what color to fill each pixel on the image plane.
For example, if there’s a blue sphere in the center of the scene, the corresponding pixel on the image plane will also be colored blue.</p>
<p>But how will the ray tracer know what color to fill in those pixels?
After all, there’s no real light in our 3D scene – it’s just a bunch of data.
Here’s where the ingenious intuition of ray tracing comes into play.
We can use the same principle that makes a real-world camera work and simulate the rays of lights.</p>
<p>We start by generating a ray from the point of view (also called eye or camera) to the center of each pixel of the image plane.</p>
<p>Rays may or may not intersect …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2><p>Traditionally services were deployed on bare metal and in the last decades we have seen the rise of virtualisation (running additional operating systems in a operating system process) and lately containerisation (running an operating system process in a separate security context from the rest of processes on the same host). Virtualisation and containerisation offers different levels of isolation by moving some operating system functionality to the guest systems.</p><p>The following chart illustrates that pretty well:</p><p><img src="https://dev.l1x.be/img/isolation.png" alt="OS functionality location"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf">https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf</a></p><p>In this article, I perform a deep dive into Firecracker and how it can be used for deploying services on Raspberry Pi (4B).</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>There are few paths to take here. First I am going to try the easy one, using Ubuntu. Later on we can investigate the use of Alpine Linux which is much more lightweight than Ubuntu, ideal for devices like RPI.</p><h3 id="installing-the-image-on-a-microsd-card">Installing the image on a microSD card</h3><p>We need a 64 bit Ubuntu image and a microsd card.

</code></pre></div><p>Preinstalled means that we get a fully working operating system and there is no need for additional installation steps after booting up. With Balena Etcher it is super easy to write the compressed image file to the sd card and boot the system up once ready. SSHD starts up after the installation and we can log in via ssh if we know the IP address that the DHCP server issues to our device (assuming DHCP server is present in our LAN).</p><p>There are few mildly annoying things with Ubuntu (snaps, unattended-upgrades) that I usually remove. I also prefer to use Chrony over the systemd equivalent.

November 23, 2020 | https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post I’ll show you how to use a Raspberry Pi and some soldering skills to automate old Somfy blinds via the MQTT protocol exposed to Home Assistant and Google Home.</p><p>We’ve moved to a new apartment and one of its features are external blinds (a.k.a. covers) that are controlled through a dedicated remote of the Somfy brand. However, just like with a TV, finding the remote is often tricky, so I decided to try and automate the external blind movements through Home Assistant and further voice commands of Google Home.</p><p>The system in place is a Somfy’s Telis 4 RTS Pure remote, with two remotes, each being able to program 5 channels (4 individual ones and combined). The system uses a legacy, proprietary radio protocol called <a href="https://service.somfy.com/downloads/nam_v4/rts_pocket_guide_dec_2017.pdf">RTS</a>, which only Somfy and Telis use.</p><p>Somfy offers a RTS bridge called <a href="https://www.somfysystems.com/en-us/products/1811403/mylink">Somfy MyLink</a> for a wooping ~300CHF, which is a little steep for something that is not necessary and just scratching an itch. Also, there’s not much fun in that.</p><p>Turns out, <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/">Nickduino</a> had a similar itch to scratch. Using 3-4 CHF-worth of hardware components, it is quite easy to build a software radio that will immitate a Somfy Telis remote and control the blinds.</p><p>There’s an bare-bones <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Somfy_Remote/blob/master/Somfy_Remote.ino">Somfy Remote Arduino sketch</a> that shows how the protocol works. I originally wanted make the blind controller as small as possible and base it on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a>, taking that sketch and controlling it via <a href="https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt">arduino-mqtt</a>.</p><p>Turns out there is a full MQTT/web interface script <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy">Nickduino/Pi-Somfy</a> that also only goes into the details of how to solder things, and connect things onto a Raspberry Pi. Laziness won the day, especially as I wanted to use my spare Pi for something anyway.</p><h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2><p>Usually for 433MHz signals you could easily use a ready-made module such us <a href="https://www.berrybase.ch/raspberry-pi-co/raspberry-pi/module-sensoren/433mhz-sender-empf-228-nger-superregeneration-modul-fs1000a-xy-fst-xy-mk-5v">this 2CHF sender-receiver pair</a>. However, in order for Somfy to make their RTS even more proprietary than it already was, it is not using the typical <code>433.93MHz</code> frequency but <code>433.42MHz</code> 🤦‍♂️. This means one will need to do some soldering.</p><p>The PiSomfy <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy#2-hardware">hardware guide</a> is excellent in telling you what you need. I got:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/5x-433Mhz-RF-transmitter-and-receiver-kit-Module-Arduino-ARM-WL-MCU-Raspberry-Fc-/254607185239?hash=item3b47c55557">5 ready <code>433.93MHz</code> sender circuits</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-433-42m-433-42mhz-r433-f433-saw-resonator-crystals-to-39-/331637441887?hash=item4d3721c55f">10 pieces of the <code>433.42MHz</code> oscilator</a> - because my soldering is terrible</li><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/40PCS-20cm-2-54MM-FF-FM-MM-Dupont-wire-jumper-cables-male-to-female-For-Arduino/312724733910?hash=item48cfd8bfd6:g:05sAAOSwlbZdSZ6E">male-male jumper cables</a> - to avoid soldering 😉</li><li>(already had it) a solid copper cable to use as an antenna</li></ul><p>After 4 weeks, all the eBay items were in place, and I could start soldering. Turns out de-soldering things off is much harder than soldering things on. I managed to peel away the original oscillator with by applying leverage underneath it using a swiss army knife and heating its connectors one by one. Soldering the new one was quite easy in comparison.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/soldering.jpg" alt="It&amp;rsquo;s not pretty but it worked." width="600"><figcaption><p>It’s not pretty but it worked.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I then took a 17cm piece of solid copper cable, and wrapped it into a small coil. Turns out soldering a think 1mm cable to a tiny connector was the trickiest bit, but with the right amount of patience, things will stick eventually.</p><p>Eventually, the fully connected sender fits nicely into a Raspberry Pi enclosure after connecting everything to the GPIO 4 pin:</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/final_side_by_side.jpg" alt="All fits nicely into a standard Pi enclosure. The remote we&amp;rsquo;ll be replacing are on the left." width="700"><figcaption><p>All fits nicely into a standard Pi enclosure. The remote we’ll be replacing are on the left.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="programming">Programming</h2><p>Installing Pi-Somfy is super easy, just follow <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy#3-software">these steps</a>. It assume you install it under the default <code>pi</code> user in <code>/home/pi</code>, and comes with a handy <code>systemctl</code> service for auto-starting the system.</p><p>By default it will come up on port <code>:80</code> of your Pi. Programming the blinds takes a little bit of time. The procedure is as follows:</p><ul><li>Set the right channel (individual blind, or all) on the remote you’re programming from.</li><li>Measure the time in seconds it takes for each blind to come fully down.</li><li>Click <em>Add new</em> to put in the name (this will be your MQTT name by the way) and add in the time.</li><li>Using a pen, press the “hole” on the other side of the remote. This sends the signal to the blind to accept programming a new remote.</li><li>Press <em>Save</em> and follow the instructions. The blind should “wiggle” once programmed.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The system relies on time to figure out where the blind is percentage-wise. It can often get things wrong (e.g. if you stopped it mid-through), or on the all-channel if blinds have different lengths (e.g. balcony). But in practice it works remarkably well.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/pi_remote.png" alt="Fully programmed blinds." width="700"><figcaption><p>Fully programmed blinds.</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a> is a standard protocol for message brokers, and finds a lot of use in home IoT. For most use cases, it has a simple publish-subscribe mechanic based on topics.</p><h2 id="installing-mosquitto">Installing Mosquitto</h2><p>Home Assistant has an embedded MQTT broker, but it is <em>highly advised</em> to use an external one, such as Mosquitto. You should install it on the same machine that runs Home Assistant, as it will act as a hub for other MQTT-connected services. To do that on Ubuntu:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s set up a password file in <code>/etc/mosquitto/passwd</code> with a user for <code>homeassistant</code> and <code>pisomfy</code>.</p><pre><code>sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd homeassistant
Password: YourHomeAssistantPassword
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd pisomfy
Password: YourPiSomfyPassword
</code></pre><p>Then, enforce use of passwords in mosquitto by editing <code>/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf</code> and changing it to:</p><pre><code>allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
</code></pre><p>For debugging purposes, open a separate tab on the same machine and subscribe to all messages under the <code>home-assistant/#</code> topic via:</p><pre><code>mosquitto_sub -u homeassistant -P YourHomeAssistantPassword -p 1883 -h 127.0.0.1 -v -t "home-assistant/#"
</code></pre><p>This will come in handy to check things are working.</p><h2 id="configuring-home-assistant">Configuring Home Assistant</h2><p>Update your <code>/etc/homeassistant/configuration.yaml</code> to add:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>mqtt</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>broker</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>127.0.0.1</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>homeassistant</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>password</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"YourHomeAssistantPassword"</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>discovery</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Restart Home Assistant</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart homeassistant
</code></pre><h3 id="configure-pisomfy">Configure PiSomfy</h3><p>On your Pi machine, open <code>/home/pi/operateShutters.conf</code> and edit the `[MQTT] section to look as follows</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[MQTT]</span>
<span># Location (IP Address of DNS Name) of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Server</span> <span>=</span> <span>myHAmachine # or hostname of your home assistant machine</span>
<span># Port of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Port</span> <span>=</span> <span>1883</span>
<span># Username for the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_User</span> <span>=</span> <span>pisomfy</span>
<span># Password of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>YourPiSomfyPassword</span>
<span># Enable auto discovery</span>
<span>EnableDiscovery</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And restart the service:</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart shutters.conf`
</code></pre><p>At this point the tab with the subscriptions should be full of messages. These are auto-discovery messages over MQTT for each of the programmed covers. This will cause Home Assistant to automatically add the entities.</p><p>They should show up with the same names as in PiSomfy.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/home_assistant_entities.png" alt="Home Assistant Entities auto discovered via MQTT." width="800"><figcaption><p>Home Assistant Entities auto discovered via MQTT.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Adding them to a dashboard is relatively trivial, for example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>entities</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>entities</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>entity</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>cover.lr_all</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Living Room Covers</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In order to simplify things, I wanted to only expose the <code>_all</code> blinds (a.k.a. covers) to Google Home/Assistant. For that I added an explicit section in the <code>/etc/homeassistant/configuration.yaml</code> section of <code>google_assistant</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>google_assistant</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span># ...</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>exposed_domains</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>fan</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>entity_config</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>cover.br_all</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>expose</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>aliases</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span>- <span>"Bedroom Covers"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>cover.lr_all</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>expose</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>aliases</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span>- <span>"Living Room Covers"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>After restarting Home Assistant, and uttering the magical <em>Ok Google, Sync All Devices</em>, the covers will show up in your Home App:</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/google_home.jpg" alt="Looks like a blind, acts as a blind." width="300"><figcaption><p>Looks like a blind, acts as a blind.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This means you can controll it using keywords:</p><ul><li><em>Ok Google, close Bedroom covers</em></li><li><em>Ok Google, open Bedroom covers</em></li><li><em>Ok Google, set Bedroom covers to 50%</em></li></ul><p>The killer feature is setting this up as a routine to open/close the blind as you wake up, go to sleep.</p><p>Happy hacking :)</p></div></div>]]>

                Google announced Material Design on June 25, 2014, at the 2014

                explained that, "unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform
                intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide
                meaning about what you can touch." Google states that their new design language is
                based on paper and ink but implementation takes place in an advanced manner.<sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup data-toggle="tooltip" id="cite_ref-3"><a data-toggle="tooltip" href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a data-toggle="tooltip" href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                Material Design will gradually be extended throughout Google's array of web and
                mobile products, providing a consistent experience across all platforms and
                applications. Google has also released

                (APIs) for third-party developers to incorporate the design language into their

                The main purpose of material design is creation of new visual language that combines

                In 2018, Google detailed a revamp of the language, with a focus on providing more
                flexibility for designers to create custom "themes" with varying geometry, colors,
                and typography. Google released Material Theme Editor exclusively for the

                In 2018, with the introduction of the ability to create custom themes, Google also
                began redesigning most of their apps into a customized and adapted version of
                Material Design called the Google Material Theme<sup data-toggle="tooltip" id="cite_ref-10"><a data-toggle="tooltip" href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>, also dubbed "Material Design 2"<sup data-toggle="tooltip" id="cite_ref-11"><a data-toggle="tooltip" href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>, which heavily emphasized white space, rounded corners, colorful icons, bottom

It can even spoof critical beacon signals as those from aircraft transponders or GPS satellites. </p><p>As of the time of this post the currently available decoders and transmit options can be seen in the screenshots below.  Note that for the transmitter options, there are some there that could really land you in trouble with the law so be very careful to exercise caution and only transmit what you are legally allowed to.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/37de762b5b6f97bb464fdd6179ce9f37cdd05785731fee0b8d461eb55bf0f84c.png"></p><p>The PortaPack add-on hardware to the HackRF was released several years ago  but the firmware was not developed very far beyond listening to audio and implementing a few transmitters. For a time this interesting device was forgotten compared to its brother HackRF. After some years the third party 'Havoc' firmware by 'furrtek' greatly expanded the list of  decoders and transmit options. Unfortunately the havok firmware is no longer maintained so we're now looking at the open-source <a href="https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MAYHEM firmware</a> by ’eried’, an active fork with even more features.</p><p>Another reason why the Portapack is becoming more popular is because of its dropping price. Both the Portapack and the HackRF are open source hardware, anyone can produce their own device based on the code and available designs. Therefore a "clone" of Portapack is just as good as an original one. With open source code hardware there is no such thing as genuine hardware. For this reason, right now it is possible to find a complete <a href="https://bit.ly/2UUKgRG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HackRF and Portapack kits offers from China</a>, for half the $500 which is what it initially cost when it was released years ago.</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>There are two versions of the portapack: the Portapack H1 and the Portapack H2, the only difference is the screen size. Both are fully compatible with MAYHEM, in my case I choose the H1 because is cheaper.</p><p>Installing the firmware is really easy. One of the characteristics of the HackRF along with the Portapack is that it is practically impossible to brick, so there is no need to worry about this process. It is always recommended to update the firmware with the latest realease of the project, since although some vendors even include the old Havoc or even the new Mayhem firmware, they are rarely the latest version since it is a project that adds constant improvements.</p><p>Download last release from <a href="https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases</a></p><h4>Windows</h4><ol><li>Connect the device via USB</li><li>Switch to HackRF mode via the on-screen option (in the PortaPack)</li><li>Double click <code>flash_portapack_mayhem.bat</code> and follow the instructions</li><li>Reboot the device</li></ol><h4>Linux</h4><ol><li>Connect the device via USB</li><li>Switch to HackRF mode via the on-screen option (in the PortaPack)</li><li>Upload the firmware with <code>hackrf_spiflash -w new_firmware_file.bin</code></li><li>Reboot the device</li></ol><h2><strong>Hands-on Testing</strong></h2><p>The list of supported radio protocols on MAYHEM is impressive: Police Scanner, IQ file replay,  Microphone FM transmit with CTCSS, CTCSS decoder, Frequency manager (save &amp; load from SD card, with categories and notes), "Soundboard" wave file player from  files in SD card , ADS-B receiver with map view, ADS-B transmitter (aircraft spoof), SSTV transmitter, Fully configurable jammer, POCSAG transmitter, POCSAG receiver/decoder, Morse transmitter (FM tone and CW), OOK transmitter for common remote encoders (PT2262, doorbells, remote outlets, some garage doors, ...), RDS (Radio Data System) PSN, RadioText and Time groups transmitter, Meteorological ballon radiosonde receiver (M10, M2K2, ...) , AFSK receiver, AFSK transmitter (Bell202, ...) , Nuoptix DTMF sync transmitter, French LCR (Language de Commande Routier) message generator,  Street lighting control transmitter (CCIR tones), Fully configurable RF signal generator, car TPMS decoder, car keyfoob spoofer (Subaru), Nordic NRF decoder, APRS decoder and transmitter, RSSI audio output as pitch (for direction finding), BurgerPager Spoofer, and more. </p><p>For audio RX/TX you need a TRRS (3 ring) jack plug with the Left-Right-Mic-Ground arrangement.

Quadrature signals, also called IQ signals, IQ data or IQ samples, are often used in RF applications. They form the basis of complex RF signal modulation and demodulation, both in hardware and in software, as well as in complex signal analysis. </p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/e1e529faea7da42ebc0d3c7482281688438d438bd58d75248778ff1c9ffa95d7.png"></p><p>For simplicity, you can consider that an IQ capture is a raw capture without any type of demodulation applied and that holds enough information to later be able to analyze its content and decode. Conversely, if we encode a RF signal in IQ format, it will be very easy to send it to the air.</p><p>Black Hills Infosec has a great introduction to RF Replay attacks over their blog. <a href="https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-replay-rf-signals-using-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-replay-rf-signals-using-sdr/</a></p><p>The best thing about the Portapack is that you do not need practically any RF knowledge or work to launch this attack, therefore it is very easy to check whether a system is vulnerable or not, before taking the time to analyzing the protocol in more depth.</p><p><strong>REMOTE CONTROLS</strong></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/9622d19919fe2d8c3271835fea7fb2ccf707994339c8d3d0b433f910ca416ee7.jpeg"></p><p>Many of the remote-control systems we use today still use insecure protocols without any encryption or spread spectrum. Furthermore, systems based on fixed codes are still extensively used. That make basic wireless remote control rather easy to implement, but also utterly insecure. They are commonly used in inexpensive wireless devices to control garage doors, fans, toys and even some alarm systems.</p><p>Our Portapack supports sending command through various remote-control protocols. Among them the PT2262/PT2272. These ICs utilize fixed address codes and no inherent encryption so they are not high security devices.</p><p>PT2272 presents 4 bits of data and uses 8 bits address. Keep in mind that these are tri-state bits, so they can have low, float and high states. Capturing these codes from the air is incredibly easy with an SDR and software like rtl_433.  Addressing is often implemented with solder pads but, occasionally with jumpers and rarely with tri-state dip switches.  And a special note, as we have said the floating value (without any soldering) is totally valid and would work fine. Therefore in the world there are possibly thousands or tens of thousands  PT2272 devices installed by default where no code was configured so are working using the FFFFFF address.</p><p><strong>POCSAG</strong></p><p>A pager (also known as a beeper) is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. Pagers became widely used by the 1980s. In the 21st century, the widespread availability of cellphones and smartphones has greatly diminished the pager industry. Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency services and public safety personnel, because pager systems reliability in some cases, including during natural and man-made disasters. This resilience has led public safety agencies to still adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/36d41b79f69415348d802e12e78e7ccc8d4922b4a522414a135a3823baa01405.png"></p><p>Although there are several protocols for Pagers the most common is POCSAG. This protocol dates from the 80s and although there are more modern alternatives, it has become the de facto standard in the industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/nhs-pagers-medical-health-data/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACZR9IHPYbq7SUYuzrM7Fs-IXdOi6U2iEmmte1ckW9sdBkKjXuwog8HTVBNTPTJd0gxyb-Xr68nClGiopHSYFVhgBXZbrgWOd0L88OyPaGncTCA77v55GXcwGY99gQHiwhq3H2t4vLRPViqJVlY9aoKlTfO89v6SBfTo8hNXaf9W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pagers have been under the scrutiny of information security experts for some time now as it is common for hospital pagers to spew out unencrypted patient data into the air for anyone with a radio and computer to decode</a>.

We only need to know the Freq, RIC address and the speed expected by the destination pager. All of this information could be easly be sniffed using the POCSAG sniffer or with  HackRF running software like <a href="https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Multimon-ng</a>.

<p><strong>GitOps</strong> offers a way to automate and manage infrastructure. It does this by using the same DevOps best practices that many teams already use, such as version control, code review, and CI/CD pipelines.</p>



<p>Companies have been adopting DevOps because of its great potential to improve productivity and software quality. Along the way, we’ve found ways to automate the software development lifecycle. But when it comes to infrastructure setup and deployments, it’s still mostly a manual process.</p>



<p>With GitOps teams can <strong>automate the infrastructure provisioning process</strong>. This is due to the ability to write your infrastructure as code (IaC) with the use of declaration files. We can store them in a Git repository, exactly as we store application development code.</p>



<h2>How does GitOps work?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The GitOps concept was initially introduced by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.weave.works/" target="_blank">Weave</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.weave.works/" target="_blank">w</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.weave.works/" target="_blank">orks</a>, a Kubernetes management company. So discussions around GitOps are mainly in the context of Kubernetes. The transformation to microservices running in containers brought a need for orchestration platforms. Container-based applications can be complex and difficult for provisioning and management. GitOps helps in simplifying this by applying techniques proven in the DevOps world.</p>



<p>Nowadays the idea has become popular among DevOps enthusiasts, representing an <strong>upgraded model of the IaC concept</strong>. It revolves around 3 major components:</p>



<ol><li>Infrastructure as code</li><li>Pull requests</li><li>CI/CD</li></ol>



<p><em>Let’s look at them separately.</em></p>



<h3>Infrastructure as Code</h3>



<p>IaC is a practice of provisioning and managing infrastructure as <strong>declaration files,</strong> stored as code. By leveraging IaC and version control teams can optimize all operational procedures.</p>



<p>GitOps centers around the <strong>declarative model of IaC. </strong>This is why Kubernetes is a great example of implementation. Declarative means that configuration is more a declaration of an expected state, instead of a set of commands. For example, in Kubernetes, you can define the number of pods desired for a service in the manifest. The system will then take care of itself. No need for an engineer to write an imperative script that should get to the desired pod number.</p>



<p>Any cloud-native software that conforms to the declarative model can be treated as code. We use AWS CloudFormation, which is a declarative tool, to write AWS infrastructure. This means that <strong>we can treat infrastructure itself as code</strong>. Declare the desired state as code. The system applies the changes to achieve that state with automation.</p>



<p>With that said, declarative models are not a must to benefit in GitOps. You can do as well with imperatively defined environments.</p>



<h3>Pull requests</h3>



<p>The main idea behind the GitOps concept is that the version control system is a single source of truth. We use Git as a change management system for our application code. We can also use it for our infrastructure code. So the entire set of declaration files is in a single place where you can collaborate. This enables us to use the key concept of Git – the <strong>pull request</strong> for operational changes.</p>



<p>In an app development workflow, we use one main branch as a release branch. Developers create feature branches from the main branch. Develop a particular feature or story and when done create a pull request to merge it back into the main branch. This same approach is convenient for infrastructure code.</p>



<p>Creating a pull request enables the code to go through a process of code review before we integrate it into another branch of the codebase. Code reviews stop bad code from getting into test or production environments. This is even more important for infrastructure code. Having formal approvals in place via code reviews helps a lot with the auditing and troubleshooting.</p>



<h4>Git organization</h4>



<p>The deployment process in GitOps requires at least two repos: the <strong>application repo</strong> and the <strong>environment configuration repo</strong>. The first one contains the source code of the app together with its deployment manifests. The second one contains the desired state of the whole system described using a declarative specification for each environment. You can describe your environments as dev, test, production in a code repository, containing the applications and infrastructure services that can run with a particular version of that environment.</p>



<p>In the case of infrastructure, the main branch can represent an environment. We can implement the changes in the feature branch. Then create a pull request to merge the changes in the main branch. With this, we enable collaboration, while being transparent of who performed which changes. This is also beneficial for issue tracking to the root cause since all changes are commits in Git.</p>



<p>GitOps works with any Git-based system, like GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab. It is not dependent on any tool or technology.</p>



<h3>CI/CD</h3>



<p>To achieve a full GitOps implementation, you need a <strong>CI/CD pipeline</strong>. With automated delivery pipelines you can deliver infrastructure changes to designated environments, each time there is a change in the Git repository.<br>Pipelines are here to connect your Git pull requests to the orchestration system. When you trigger the pipeline with a pull request, the orchestration system executes the task.</p>



<p>There are two possibilities for a GitOps deployment strategy: <strong>Push and Pull Pipelines</strong>. The difference between them is in the way you ensure the deployment environment resembles the desired infrastructure.</p>



<h4>Push Pipelines</h4>



<p>Many popular CI/CD tools are using this strategy. We store the source code of the application and its deployment manifests in one repository. The build pipeline triggers when a new update happens in the application code. The pipeline builds the container images and pushes the changes to the environment. This strategy brings more flexibility, as it can support any type of infrastructure. The disadvantage is that it gives the CI/CD tool access to write to your environment.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-push-1024x548.png" alt="Push-based GitOps Deployments" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-push-1024x548.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-push-300x160.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-push-768x411.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-push.png 1161w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Push-based GitOps Deployments</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Pull Pipelines</h4>



<p>The community considers the pull pipeline approach a more secure practice for GitOps. With this approach, the operator is introduced. <strong>The operator</strong> is a component between the pipeline and the orchestration tool. It constantly compares the target state in the environment repository with the actual state in the deployed infrastructure. The operator changes the infrastructure to fit the environment repository if it detects any changes. Also, it’s possible to monitor the image registry to identify new versions of images to deploy. This is what makes GitOps so special.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-operator-1024x558.png" alt="Pull-based GitOps Deployments" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-operator-1024x558.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-operator-300x163.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-operator-768x418.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gitops-operator.png 1353w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Pull-based GitOps Deployments</figcaption></figure>



<p>In GitOps the environment updates happen only when there are changes in the environment repository. The system reverts any modifications made if the implemented infrastructure changes in any manner not defined in the environment repository.</p>



<p>For most applications, you’ll probably need more than one environment. GitOps allows you to create <strong>multiple pipelines</strong> that can change the environment repository. You can use separate branches in the environment repository to manage more environments. The operator can react to the change of one branch by deploying to production and react to another branch by deploying to test.</p>



<h2>What are the benefits of GitOps?</h2>



<h3>Using DevOps best practices</h3>



<p>Since GitOps is a model focused on the pre-existing best practices of Git workflow, IaC, CI/CD pipelines, immutable servers, tracking, and observability, it represents a more advanced state of Kubernetes’ cloud-native application management. Therefore, the current stack and experience within the company can serve a lot.</p>



<h3>Continuous deployment—simplified</h3>



<p><a href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/">Continuous deployment</a> means deploying faster and more often. Due to different considerations such as statefulness of systems, downtime resistance, upstream/downstream dependencies, and many other organizational relevant processes and dependencies, proper continuous deployment has been very challenging.</p>



<p>GitOps allows you to do this <strong>without having to manage a bunch of tools</strong> as everything occurs in the version control system. It provides structure and automation, thanks to the deployment operator.</p>



<p>This also increases productivity and faster MTTD (Mean-time-to-deployment). Automated continuous deployment ensures that the team can ship 30-100 times more changes every day, increasing average production performance 2-3 times.</p>



<h3>Lower MTTR (Mean-time-to-repair)</h3>



<p>MTTR is one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/13-devops-metrics-for-increased-productivity/" target="_blank">key metrics</a> DevOps teams should measure. Even small issues can be very challenging to repair in a <a href="https://microtica.com/everything-about-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microservice architecture</a>. As GitOps keeps all changes in the version control system and the management is automated, it is possible to reduce MTTR significantly. You have a full overview of how the environment has changed and error recovery becomes quite easy.</p>



<h3>Simplified Kubernetes management</h3>



<p>Without getting to know Kubernetes thoroughly, developers can use familiar tools such as Git to handle Kubernetes upgrades and features more easily. Newly-embedded developers will get up to speed easily and be active in days rather than months.</p>



<h3>Improved standardization across the company</h3>



<p>You have transparent end-to-end workflows through the entire enterprise because GitOps has one framework for rendering applications, software, and Kubernetes add-on modifications. Git also fully reproduces your operations activities.</p>



<h2>How to prepare for GitOps?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Establish a stable code review and testing process.</strong> Carefully reviewing code changes can point out some obvious actions, like adding a global variable. It can prevent bad code from being released. You can then submit the validated code through pull requests, allowing no changes to be committed directly by developers. Once the pull request is reviewed and merged, you can trigger the pipeline. This is the first step in maintaining a high standard of code and subsequent stability of the system.</li></ul>

<p><em>Why do we only grow certain crops in certain areas?</em></p>



<p>One observation of agriculture production is the difference in species adaptation of various places around the world: bananas grown Central America, nuts and vegetables in California, citrus fruits in Florida, apples in Washington or New York, peanuts from the Southeast, etc. The is mostly a product of economic realities and efficiency: It is easier and cheaper to manage production (of whatever) when things are located physically near each other. This isn’t unique to agriculture, as many supply chains coalesce around centralized regions (electronic device productions, automobiles, etc.). Agriculture and food production supply chain occupy a different place on humanities priority list however, and despite applying a similar ethos to essential and luxury items, there have been few catastrophic consequences from these decisions. Agriculture and the food supply chain has mostly <em>found a way</em> over the past ~100 years. It may be time to rethink or start planning for a different strategy. One possible strategy to overcome disease and pest issues that currently reduce or harm our food production systems is to <em>decentralize</em> the areas we produce many of these crops. This would potentially alleviate several problems: 1) if a pest or pathogen infests one area, the entire crop is not lost 2) transportation costs can be reduced to the consumer resulting in 3) faster delivery from harvest to consumer (thereby increasing quality and taste).</p>



<p>To be clear, decentralization is catching on in various industries (e.g. finance technology platforms), but the concept has always been baked into agriculture without much fanfare. Residents of the United States that have travelled to Hawaii may remember <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/" target="_blank">USDA APHIS</a> having an interest in certain plant species you may may brought along (or are trying to remove). All of that paperwork and questionnaire’s are to mitigate unintended introductions of invasive species or pathogens. One of the most economically devastating pests to harm soybean production (in the United States) is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/nematode/pdlessons/Pages/SoyCystNema.aspx" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/nematode/pdlessons/Pages/SoyCystNema.aspx" target="_blank">soybean cyst nematode</a>. This pathogen was not native to the United States and was <em>introduced</em> ~75 years ago. Any mitigations to prevent its spread were ineffective due to its pathogenicity and the sheer scale of soybean production in the United States. Major rows crops such as maize, soybean, wheat, and cotton reside in a different tier regarding scale of production compared to ‘specialty’ crops (namely fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, etc.) and are not candidates for decentralizing strategies.</p>



<p>There are several high level strategies for optimizing production and profitability of the food we eat. For example, over the past ~125 years we have been optimizing maize production for the Midwest region of the United States via technological (tractors, chemical) and scientific (adapted hybrids) means. We have been successful doing this because maize was already able to be grown in Midwest thanks to the thousands of years of gradual adaptation to the United States from a plant native to Mexico (that plant being: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2009/03/23/corn-domesticated-from-mexican-wild-grass-8700-years-ago/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2009/03/23/corn-domesticated-from-mexican-wild-grass-8700-years-ago/" target="_blank">teosinte</a>). For as ubiquitous as maize is to the Midwest region of the United States, mother nature did not produce that outcome, man did. It took a long time, but humans successfully shifted the areas of adaptation of maize and indeed many other crops to what we currently see today. Tomatoes are another good example of humans bending plants to our will: Italy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/italy-italian-processed-tomato-overview-2018#:~:text=Italy%20is%20a%20world%20leading,more%20than%20%E2%82%AC3.1%20billion.&amp;text=Italy%20is%20both%20a%20leading%20exporter%20and%20importer%20of%20tomato%20products." data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/italy-italian-processed-tomato-overview-2018#:~:text=Italy%20is%20a%20world%20leading,more%20than%20%E2%82%AC3.1%20billion.&amp;text=Italy%20is%20both%20a%20leading%20exporter%20and%20importer%20of%20tomato%20products." target="_blank">produces around 50% of European and ~15% processed tomatoes</a> despite tomatoes not being introduced until the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" target="_blank">Age of Discovery</a>. Bending or manipulating useful plants to grow in non-native areas is as old as farming (~10,000 BCE). Better yet, all of this adaptation was accomplished using <em>existing, </em>or native, genetic variation within their own species.</p>



<p>The theme of these examples is: ‘<em>It is possible</em>‘. With modern genomic information, we now have the tooling to do this for innumerable species. We need to start doing the same for more high value crops–namely species that are grown in geographically concentrated areas (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" target="_blank">citrus</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/us/USA_Peanut_Total_Lev2_Prod.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/us/USA_Peanut_Total_Lev2_Prod.png" target="_blank">nuts</a>, vegetables, etc.). Modern tools (genome editing, genomic sequence data, phylogeny trees, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189332/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189332/" target="_blank">mutagenesis</a>) could allow us to make these species adapted to more diverse growing regions via photoperiod sensitivity changes, cold tolerance, heat tolerance, altitude sensitivity, flowering time and length, growth habitat, and many more traits that define ‘adaptation’ to a given geographical unit. Many scientific studies focus on utilizing natural diversity to make production greater in <em>existing</em> areas of adaptation. This makes sense (despite being short-sighted on rare occasions): growing crops is a for-profit industry so it makes sense to harness the species that are already well-adapted to the region maximize those efficiencies. But again, food production cannot be exclusively dominated by this myopic view; after all many government would deem food supply and production as a national security topic. Clearly, the United States government acts as if they believe this to some degree as well, with heavily subsidies buoying maize, soybean, cotton, and wheat production (along with several other meat and dairy industries).</p>



<p>There are other reasons to look into decentralizing production of key species though. If we had citrus that was adapted to Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Michigan, these growing regions could avoid the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp" target="_blank">citrus greening problems</a> of the Southeast United States by sheer physical isolation. To be clear this problem does not have an all or none solution. We need strategies to circumvent disease and pathogens <em>in</em> their current areas of production and even if production of most fruits, vegetables <em>could</em> be done in dozens of decentralized regions it adds overhead to research and development programs as they might have to tackle 5 small problems versus 1 big problem. These are known problems in centralized structures versus decentralized structures. Since food production has unique value to humans, it worth exploring whether the costs outweigh the benefits. Fruit species in particular are extremely perishable, so while the consumers values taste and quality, the producer and supplier values transportability and storage. If we remove the logistics of long distance transport via increasing production centers, scientists could focus on improving taste and quality.</p>



<p>An obvious argument against pursuing a decentralized strategy in specialty crops is the potential rise of indoor/vertical (and de-facto isolated) farms. This is an interesting proposition but I maintain the scale of production for many species of interest is simply too large to be handled in a cost effective manner in a indoor operation. Remember, outdoor grown crops have free energy in the sun and free nutrients from the soil. Indoor agriculture has to supply these somehow (and they are not free). That’s not to dismiss indoor agriculture as a supplementary component as it already is for several crops, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=92604" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=92604" target="_blank">as about ~25% of tomatoes non-outdoor origins</a>. I continue to maintain indoor agriculture production systems can only even be sustainable for extremely high-value, low utilization specialty crops that cannot harness outdoor production systems (think spices, niche vegetables). It should be an active goal to get fruit, vegetables, and nut production decentralized in an outdoor setting that can harness soil and sunlight that are already prevalent.</p>



<p>High level movements like this are needed in agriculture to secure the food supply and add some shock absorbers to any potential pest or pathogen disruption. There is to much technology at our fingertips to not get something going. It simply appears the marker is ignoring this segment while most of the focus remains on <em>current</em> production regions.</p>

     <p><i>By Andrea Yip on November 23, 2020</i>
     
     </p><p>A portfolio is a tool for data professionals to use to share their perspective, tell their story, and most importantly, stand out of the crowd. A strong portfolio is concise, clear, and compelling. We recently talked about tips and a checklist of what should be in your personal portfolio in a <a href="https://phaseai.com/resources/data-science-portfolio">recent Phase AI blog post</a>.

     </p><p>Many of you asked for examples of stellar portfolios, so we searched the web and found diverse portfolios that demonstrate how folks have taken different approaches to showcasing their work. 

     </p><p>Below are our favorites. We hope you take inspiration from their work!

     </p><h2>Charlie Thompson</h2>

     <p>Charlie Thompson is a Data Scientist at Spotify who has previously worked in data roles at Booz Allen Hamilton, Storyblocks and at his own consulting firm, Thompson Analytics. Charlie features some amazing personal projects and thought pieces on his website. One blog favorite is an experiment where he adds GIFs to ggplots. He pulls this off using a dancing GIF of Thom Yorke, frontman of Radiohead, and adds this to a plot of album “danceability.” A key finding? Radiohead has gotten more danceable over time.<br>&nbsp;
     
     </p><center><img src="https://phaseai.com/static/img/portfolios_post_img_thompson1.gif"><br><i>A GIF from Charlie’s blog post</i><br>&nbsp;</center>
     
     <p>Another great example is a portfolio piece called Sentify that analyzes music sentiment from your favorite artists on Spotify with R Shiny. I chose to test out Sentify with one of my favorite artists, Beyonce, and took a screenshot of the output: 

     </p><center><img src="https://phaseai.com/static/img/portfolios_post_img_thompson2.png"></center>

     <p>Looks like Queen Bey makes music that is more turbulent/angry and happy/joyful.

<p>So day one went fairly smooth. Nothing too difficult to implement, as you can
expect from a first challenge. Since I’ve done some of the challenges last year
(implemented them in Go), I know that there will be a rapid ramp-up in
difficulty and that a number of challenges build “on top of each other”.
Perfect opportunities to start exploring how to write reuseable Haskell code.</p>
<p>But we’ll tackle that when the opportunity actually presents itself and not
make things more difficult than needed.</p>

<p>I will not describe the entire problem again, Advent of Code is way better at
that. But to make things simple: read numbers from a file, start at the first
number, execute an action based on the number and write the result of the
action somewhere.</p>
<p>In the first “note” (I wouldn’t call these ramblings articles) I started out
with some boilerplate by setting up the required files for Cabal, but lets not
do that this time, since I realised we don’t really need it (just yet).</p>
<p>I’ll just create a directory, create a Main.hs file and run stuff from GHCi to
get things working. In the end I’ll try to modify the program to take the input
program (intcode program) from the standard input, just as a challenge.</p>

<p>Lets get our environment setup.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19$ cd day2
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ touch Main.hs

</code></pre></div><p>Great, that worked. The <code>Main.hs</code> file is still empty, but it works, no Cabal
or Stack needed to get something done. Now to open the editor from GHCi (with
<code>:edit</code> or <code>:e</code>) and start implementing this intcode machine.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">*Main&gt; :e
editor not set, use :set editor
*Main&gt; :set editor vim
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Oops, let make a mental note to actually set <code>$EDITOR</code> in my environment, guess
I don’t use it as often as thought.</p>
<p>So filling the Main.hs file with the same boilerplate as last time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
				        print raw
</code></pre></div><p>Running the <code>main</code> function in GHCi does exactly as expected, it outputs the contents of the <code>input.txt</code> file. No big deal.</p>
<p>So after stubbing out the general outline of the program this is what I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
        <span>-- split the input up into instructions (split on ,)</span>
        <span>let</span> input <span>=</span> parseInput raw
        <span>-- run the program</span>
        <span>let</span> output <span>=</span> runProgram input
        <span>-- get the value from first position in memory</span>
        <span>let</span> solution <span>=</span> output <span>!!</span> <span>0</span>
        print solution

<span>-- parseInput takes a string as input and outputs</span>
<span>-- an array of integers</span>
<span>parseInput</span> <span>=</span> id

<span>-- runProgram takes a piece of memory and returns</span>
<span>-- the state of memory after the program has completed</span>
<span>runProgram</span> <span>=</span> id
</code></pre></div><p>So we have two high level functions to define, sounds doable.</p>
<p>First challenge is to find a way to split the input string on the comma’s
separating the individual memory values. I heard “real Haskell programmers” use
<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> to find the functions they are looking for
based on the type signature they think “should get the job done”.</p>
<p>Since we’re looking to split a string based on a different string, the required
type signature should look something like <code>String -&gt; String -&gt; [String]</code>. But
after <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String+-%3E+String+-%3E+%5BString%5D&amp;scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform">searching Hoogle for
it</a> I couldn’t find anything that looks like it might do the job. Of course I could
have just searched for a function called split, or some variation of it, but I wanted
to do it “the real way"TM. Luckily, after reading an article on <a href="https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/5/15/untangling-haskells-strings">Monday Morning Haskell</a>
I remembered that Haskell also has a <code>Text</code> type, offering some additional string handling
abilities.</p>

<div>
	<p>
    💡 I remain blisfully unaware of other benefits of using the `Text` type, please enlighten me if you want to.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Re-running the search with <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Text+-%3E+Text+-%3E+%5BText%5D&amp;scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform"><code>Text -&gt; Text -&gt; [Text]</code></a> yielded exactly the result I was looking for: <code>splitOn</code>. So feeding the <code>raw</code> data into <code>splitOn</code> and splitting on <code>,</code> gives us a <code>[String]</code> which we only need to convert into a <code>[Int]</code>. The <code>splitOn</code> function is included in the <code>Data.Text</code> package, so we’ll have to import that as well. But then, the <code>readFile</code> we use to load the data gives us a <code>String</code>, so we’ll have to import <code>Data.Text.IO</code> as well to be able to utilize the <code>readFile</code> function from that (all found by using Hoogle).</p>
<p>At this point, let’s reconsider our solution of using the <code>splitOn</code> function as provided by <code>Data.Text</code> and research Hoogle for a different <code>splitOn</code> function. Turns out, there is a <code>splitOn</code> variant in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split-0.2.3.4/docs/Data-List-Split.html#v:splitOn"><code>Data.List.Split</code></a> that is generic (i.e. it accepts anything of the type <code>Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code>) so will probably accept a <code>String</code> as well. Let’s try it out in GHCi.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? <span>for</span> help
Prelude&gt; :m + Data.List.Split
Prelude Data.List.Split&gt; splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span>
<span>[</span><span>"1"</span>,<span>"2"</span>,<span>"3"</span>,<span>"4"</span>,<span>"5"</span><span>]</span>
Prelude Data.List.Split&gt; :t splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span>
splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span> :: <span>[[</span>Char<span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Awesome, we get something back that looks like a <code>[String]</code> (since a <code>String</code> is a <code>[Char]</code>). So we’ll be good to go to use this.</p>
<p>So let’s write a simple function to do this, iterate (<code>map</code>) over all the individual items and <code>read</code> them into a <code>[Int]</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- parseInput takes a string as input and outputs</span>
<span>-- an array of integers</span>
<span>-- parseInput :: String -&gt; [Int]</span>
<span>parseInput</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>parseInput</span> x <span>=</span> map read <span>$</span> splitOn <span>","</span> x
</code></pre></div><p>That takes care of getting our input ready. The second step involves a small nuance in the challenge:</p>
<pre><code>    Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
    assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
    just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the
    program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the
    value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?
</code></pre>
<p>So we have to set the first value of the program to 12, and the second value to 2. This calls for a function
to replace a certain index in a <code>List</code>. At this point we could choose to replace the usage of <code>List</code> with <code>Data.Vector</code> which
offers this functionality by default. But for simplicity sake, let’s stay with our current solution and create a <code>replace</code> function
that takes an <code>Int</code> (the index), another <code>Int</code> (the new value) and a <code>List</code>, and returns a <code>List</code>. To build this function we use the <code>splitAt</code> function
provided by <code>Data.List.Split</code>, which we imported in the previous step anyway.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>replace</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>replace</span> i v xs <span>=</span> <span>let</span> (hxs, <span>_</span><span>:</span>txs) <span>=</span> splitAt i xs <span>in</span>
								   hxs <span>++</span> v <span>:</span> txs
</code></pre></div><p>which, when tested in GHCi, yields exactly what we want:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; replace <span>2</span> <span>99</span> <span>[</span>1,2,3,4,5<span>]</span>
<span>[</span>1,2,99,4,5<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So we can construct our actual program with <code>replace 1 12 $ replace 2 2 input</code>, store it in a variable and use that to run the actual program.</p>

<div>
	<p>
    💡 Turns out, `Data.List.Index` has a function called `setAt` which does EXACTLY the same as our `replace` function. Unfortunately, this is only available as an external library, so I choose not to use it.
  </p>
</div>

<p>We have a list of numbers, which somehow translates to instructions to be executed by a virtual computer, mutating memory. Sounds easy right?</p>
<p>IMO, this is actually the easy part, it involves us creating a function that takes 4 numbers from the list, applying a certain mutation to memory based on the values in those four numbers, taking the next four numbers, etc. Untill we find the number 99.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>runProgramAt</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>runProgramAt</span> pc m <span>=</span> <span>let</span> opcode <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> pc
												left <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>1</span>))
												right <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>2</span>))
												result <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>3</span>)
												next <span>=</span> pc <span>+</span> <span>4</span> <span>in</span>
										<span>case</span> opcode <span>of</span>
												<span>-- 99 signals the end of the program, just return</span>
												<span>-- the entire memory</span>
												<span>99</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m
												<span>-- 1 indicates addition (left + right -&gt; result), continue</span>
												<span>-- with the next operation at pc + 4</span>
												<span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> runProgramAt next <span>$</span> replace result (left <span>+</span> right) m
												<span>-- 2 indicates multiplication (left * right -&gt; result), continue</span>
												<span>-- with the next operation at pc + 4</span>
												<span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> runProgramAt next <span>$</span> replace result (left <span>*</span> right) m
												<span>-- and to satisfy the compiler, give it a fallback case</span>
												<span>-- which just returns the entire memory and stops</span>
												otherwise <span>-&gt;</span> m
</code></pre></div><p>Now when I change my <code>runProgram</code> function to use this function to run the program starting at position 0 by changing it into
<code>runProgram = runProgramAt 0</code>, and running this from GHCi I get my correct answer:</p>

<p>Really typical, part 2 of the challenge involves us finding a set of input that yields a certain output. This reeks like a standard brute-force search. These can be done really efficiently in Haskell by using <a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/relearn-you-a-haskell-part-2-list-comprehensions-tuples-and-types-g29">list comprehensions</a>. So probably we’ll end up with something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>findSolution</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>findSolution</span> s m <span>=</span> head [noun <span>*</span> <span>100</span> <span>+</span> verb <span>|</span> 
                    noun <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>0</span><span>..</span><span>99</span>], 
                    verb <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>0</span><span>..</span><span>99</span>], 
                    runProgram (replace <span>1</span> noun <span>$</span> replace <span>2</span> verb m) <span>!!</span> <span>0</span> <span>==</span> s]

</code></pre></div><p>When calling this function with the input supplied by the challenge:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- get the required input to complete part 2</span>
<span>let</span> nounverb <span>=</span> findSolution <span>19690720</span> input
<span>print</span> nounverb
</code></pre></div><p>it yields the correct solution, right away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
<span>3101844</span>
<span>8478</span>
</code></pre></div><p>where the second answer is the answer for part 2. Given that I ran this in GHCi I expected it to be a bit slower, so let’s see if that’s the case:</p>
<pre><code>*Main&gt; :set +s
*Main&gt; main
3101844
8478
(1.04 secs, 3,337,885,928 bytes)
*Main&gt;
</code></pre><p>That seems about right, let’s try compiling and timing this as a standalone binary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ ghc Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, Main.o <span>)</span>

<p>Let’s investigate how you can use built-in Python tools to both:</p>

<ul>
<li>find out exactly what any module can do, and</li>
<li>find out exactly how Python will execute your code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes debugging Python code much easier than in other languages I’ve used. You can ask any object what it does
and what data it holds - and this is <em>built in to the language!</em></p>

<p>Here’s a very basic Python class:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Vehicle</span><span>():</span>
  <span>"""A really simple class to represent vehicles."""</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>wheels</span><span>=</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>colour</span><span>=</span><span>'red'</span><span>):</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>wheels</span> <span>=</span> <span>wheels</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>colour</span> <span>=</span> <span>colour</span>
    
  <span>def</span> <span>repaint</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>colour</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Change the colour of this vehicle."""</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>colour</span> <span>=</span> <span>colour</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>If I import this class and run <code>dir</code> on it, I can see everything it does:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vehicle</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># Let's see what's in my vehicle...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dir</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'__class__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__delattr__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__dict__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__dir__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__doc__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__eq__'</span><span>,</span> 
<span>'__format__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__ge__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__getattribute__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__gt__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__hash__'</span><span>,</span> 
<span>'__init__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__init_subclass__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__le__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__lt__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__module__'</span><span>,</span> 
<span>'__ne__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__new__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__reduce__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__reduce_ex__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__repr__'</span><span>,</span> 
<span>'__setattr__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__sizeof__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__str__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__subclasshook__'</span><span>,</span> <span>'__weakref__'</span><span>,</span> 
<span>'colour'</span><span>,</span> <span>'repaint'</span><span>,</span> <span>'wheels'</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>I can see the method and attributes I gave the class: <code>repaint</code>, <code>colour</code> and <code>wheels</code>. Not only that, but <code>dir</code> also
tells me about all the built-in methods that my class has inherited from Python’s <code>object</code> class, such as <code>__eq__</code> and
<code>__str__</code>. These all start and end with a <strong>d</strong>ouble <strong>under</strong>score so we refer to them as ‘dunder’ methods. Let’s try one:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># I wonder what this method does...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v</span><span>.</span><span>__dict__</span>
<span>{</span><span>'wheels'</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>'colour'</span><span>:</span> <span>'red'</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>So my simple class automatically has a method to get its attributes in a dictionary <sup id="fnref:dict"><a href="#fn:dict">1</a></sup>! I didn’t know that… but I found
it out just by introspecting my object using <code>dir</code>.</p>

<h2 id="forensic-programming">Forensic programming</h2>

<p>If something isn’t very well documented in a library you’re using, don’t worry! You can inspect the objects
the library provides and work things out for yourself.</p>

<p>Imagine you want to make an HTTP GET request. You’ve been recommended <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">the <code>requests</code> library</a>
but let’s pretend you can’t make head or tail of the documentation <sup id="fnref:requests"><a href="#fn:requests">2</a></sup>. So, you try importing it and running <code>dir</code> on it:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>requests</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># So, what does this library give me?</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#&nbsp;Quite a lot!</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>There’s a lot there! Looks like there’s a method named <code>get</code>, maybe that will make a GET request for us? Let’s see if it’s callable:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>callable</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>)</span>
<span>True</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Great! But <em>how</em> do we call it? We’ll use a brilliant built-in module named <code>inspect</code> to tell us. It can tell us the
signature of any function or method we might be thinking of calling:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>inspect</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># What parameters does requests.get accept?</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>signature</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>)</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>Signature</span> <span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>There’s a positional argument called <code>url</code>, and an optional keyword argument named <code>params</code>. The <code>url</code> argument is
obvious. Let’s try making a request to an API that returns Bertrand Russell quotes (what else?):</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"https://bertrand.anvil.app/_/api/quote"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>Response</span> <span>[</span><span>200</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Ok… so I’ve got a response. I guess <code>200</code> is an HTTP 200 OK status, meaning it worked. But how do I get my quote?
One more use of <code>dir</code> and I see that my response has a <code>text</code> attribute:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"https://bertrand.anvil.app/_/api/quote"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>text</span>
<span>'Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise.'</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Amazing! We’ve worked out how to use the Python <code>requests</code> library using nothing but our wits and Python’s built-in introspection tools.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I spotted something strange when I ran <code>dir(requests)</code>. What is <code>requests.__cake__</code>? Maybe it ‘bakes’
a response into something I can store on disk? Maybe it’s got something to do with browser cookies? Let’s find out:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># What's this?</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>__cake__</span>
<span>'✨ 🍰 ✨'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># I see.</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>So we’ve seen how Python’s introspection can help you figure out <em>precisely</em> how to use a library, even when that library
contains undocumented methods.</p>

<p>Let’s get even more introspective. Python can gaze into its innards and see all the way through to its very guts. It can
tell you all the details of how it compiles and executes your code.</p>

<h2 id="extreme-introspection"><strong>Extreme</strong> introspection</h2>

<p>Not only will Python objects tell you what they do, but Python can tell you exactly how it plans to do it.
When Python executes your code, it does it in (at least) three steps, and you can find out the exact details of each
of them.</p>

<h3 id="how-python-understands-code">How Python understands code</h3>

<p>The first step is <strong>parsing</strong>. Python takes the raw characters of your code and turns it into a structure that represents
the meaning of the text. The long string of characters is translated into <strong>tokens</strong> that are
organised into a tree - an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong> (AST). Take a simple Python statement:</p>




<p>The abstract syntax tree looks like this:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/blog/img/introspection-in-python/ast-diagram-abstract.png" alt="What the Python parser sees when you tell it x = 4 + 8"> <figcaption>
                <p>What the Python parser sees when you tell it <code>x = 4 + 8</code></p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>This is something that must occur in all programming languages except assembly code, but not all give you such easy
access to their innards as Python does. Python ships with a module you can run on your code to see the
abstract syntax tree it generates from your code. It’s called <code>ast</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">here is it in the Python docs</a>).</p>

<p>We can get the AST for our simple statement like so:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>ast</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span> <span>=</span> <span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'x = 4 + 8'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Let’s use our introspection skills to explore that object. We run <code>dir</code> on it and see that there’s a <code>body</code> attribute:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>body</span>
<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_ast</span><span>.</span><span>Assign</span> <span>object</span> <span>at</span> <span>0x1024a8470</span><span>&gt;</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>The body of the AST is a list of all the Python statements in the code. Our program only has one Python statement, the
assignment statement <code>x = 4 + 8</code>. That’s why <code>tree</code> contains one statement, named <code>Assign</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see what’s inside the assignment. Using <code>dir</code> tells us it has things called <code>targets</code> and <code>value</code>. I bet <code>targets</code> are
the things being assigned to (<code>x</code> in our case) and <code>value</code> are the things being assigned (so for us that’s <code>4 + 8</code>).
We’ll check <code>targets</code> first:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>targets</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>'x'</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Just as we expected. Now let’s look at <code>value</code>:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>_ast</span><span>.</span><span>BinOp</span> <span>object</span> <span>at</span> <span>0x1014e3128</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>It’s a <code>BinOp</code> object - a binary operator, meaning an operator that takes two arguments. That must be our <code>+</code> operator!
We run <code>dir</code> again to see what it does, and it looks like we want to see the <code>op</code> attribute:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>op</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>_ast</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span> <span>object</span> <span>at</span> <span>0x1014d3978</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Yep, just as we expected - <code>Add</code> is clearly the token representing the <code>+</code> operator. Where are the <code>4</code> and <code>8</code>? They’re
in the <code>BinOp</code>, which has <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> attributes:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>left</span><span>.</span><span>n</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>right</span><span>.</span><span>n</span>
<span>8</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>So we have the entire AST we sketched out before, represented by Python objects in a nested structure that reflects the structure of the tree!</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/blog/img/introspection-in-python/ast-diagram-code.png" alt="How ast expresses x = 4 + 8"> <figcaption>
                <p>How <code>ast</code> expresses <code>x = 4 + 8</code></p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<h3 id="how-python-executes-code">How Python executes code</h3>

<p>So Python turns the characters that make up our code into an AST representing the <em>meaning</em> of the code, and it gives
us the <code>ast</code> module to inspect that for ourselves. But there’s more to executing the code than this. The standard
Python implementation (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a>) compiles your lovingly hand-crafted Python
code into a form of assembly language - Python Bytecode - that runs on a virtual machine. This is how Python
can ‘write once, run anywhere’. The virtual machine is compiled for various different types of computer, and the
bytecode that runs on it is completely universal.</p>

<p>Just as with <code>ast</code>, Python has a standard library module called <code>dis</code> that can show you the bytecode generated
from a given Python program. You can pass in a Python object such as a function, or you can pass in a Python program as a string:</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>dis</span> <span>import</span> <span>dis</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dis</span><span>(</span><span>'x = 4 + 8'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>1</span>           <span>0</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>12</span><span>)</span>
              <span>2</span> <span>STORE_NAME</span>               <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
              <span>4</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
              <span>6</span> <span>RETURN_VALUE</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Since this is an extremely simple Python program, it’s not hard to understand the bytecode. The first line
loads a constant onto the Python virtual machine’s memory stack:</p>




<p>The value of that constant is included in the actual
bytecode, and there’s a little optimisation here. The addition has already been carried out! The compiler has
converted the <code>4 + 8</code> into <code>12</code> so the VM doesn’t need to do that at runtime.</p>

<p>The next instruction is our assignment operator (the <code>=</code>). It instructs the VM to define a symbol <code>x</code> and store
the value at position <code>0</code> in it. This means it can refer to <code>x</code> later on in the code:</p>




<p>The compiler appears to be a little stupid here. Doesn’t it realise that this is the end of the code, and there is no ‘later on’?
In fact, our tiny program <code>x = 4 + 8</code> is a Python <em>module</em>, so the bytecode keeps track of the label <code>x</code> in case any other modules want to import it.</p>

<p>There are two more instructions that we might not have expected to see. First, <code>None</code> is loaded onto the stack. Next,
the <code>RETURN_VALUE</code> instruction is called.</p>

<div title="" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python">              <span>4</span> <span>LOAD_CONST</span>               <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
              <span>6</span> <span>RETURN_VALUE</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>We didn’t tell it to return <code>None</code>!? But all Python functions and modules …</p></article></div></div>

<p><h2><span id="Attention_is_a_resource"></span>Attention is a resource</h2></p>
<div><h3><span id="What_a_giant_had_to_say"></span>What a giant had to say</h3>
<p>A long long time ago, when the teachers were still in custody of young people's character, here is what <a href="http://www.knowledgefederation.org/index.php?title=William_James&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="William James (page does not exist)">William James</a> had to tell them about this matter:
</p><blockquote>
<p>In what does a moral act consist? It consists in the effort of attention by which we hold fast to an idea which but for that effort of attention would be driven out of the mind by the other psychological tendencies that are there. To think, in short, is the secret of will, just as it is the secret of memory.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="Attention_has_a_purpose"></span>Attention has a purpose</h3>
<p>Attention, and the emotion of interest which naturally directs it, are there for a purpose. Interest is what might move young people to explore and understand the world. And to exercise their minds and bodies.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>But our industries have been able to separate this emotion from its purposes. They created games that engage only "other psychological tendencies", so that the effort of attention that sustains a moral act is never experienced; which keep children's attention <em>away</em> from reality; which exercise no more than their thumbs and their rear ends; whose ethical message is that killing is fun; and which are so "immersive" that they make everything else – and school in particular – seem dull in comparison.</p>
<p>What will prevent our young ones from virtually <em>living</em> in the virtual world? Where success is so much easier to experience; and even the <em>ultimate</em> failure can be reversed by pressing the restart button!</p>
<h3><span id="It.27s_a_complex_world"></span>It's a complex world</h3>
<p><em>For all we know</em>, we may have created a complex and dangerous world, which will demand of our next generation the presence of spirit that we ourselves haven't been able to muster.</p>
<p>We say "for all we know", because we <em>don't</em> really know. While some of our colleagues have done research and concluded that our civilization may just barely make it, provided we make changes promptly, the rest of us continue to live and work just as we did before. Notice that we are not saying that our civilization is in trouble; others have said that. All <em>we</em> need in order to motivate our initiative follows from what we've just said. And it's anyhow obvious – it's that <em>we do not know</em> what our situation is and what we need to do; because <em>the way in which we handle knowledge is keeping us from knowing</em>.</p>
<p>And because also <em>our</em> attention has been mishandled.</p>
<h3><span id="The_economy_of_attention"></span>The economy of attention</h3>
<p>The journalists are not to be blamed. They are just trying to make ends meet in a competitive world.</p>
<p>Our friends who innovate in journalism told us that there's just about one business model left to the journalists, as a way to compete with abundant free information. They call it "attention economy", but it's not what you might think. The journalists are not economizing with our attention as a resource, by directing it where it is most needed. On the contrary – the attention economy means attracting people's attention <em>by whatever means may still be available</em>, and selling it – as a commodity, measured as the number of thousands of readers or viewers – to the advertisers.</p>
<p>And we don't need to tell you that it's those advertisers – that half-a-trillion-dollars-a-year global industry that combines state-of-the-art science with state-of-the-art communication design – that are now in charge of <em>everyone's</em> character! If they do their job right, then "the effort of attention by which we hold fast to an idea" ("do I really need this?") will yield to "the other psychological tendencies that are there" ("this looks attractive – let's have it!"). But don't blame the advertisers; this just happens to be <em>their</em> way to make a living in a competitive world.</p></div>

<div><h3><span id="Pleasure_has_a_purpose"></span>Pleasure has a purpose</h3>
<p>Neither the parents are to be blamed.</p>
<p>We parents, of course, only wish our children our best. We want them to be happy! The trouble is that we believe (because we've been <em>socialized</em> to believe) that happiness means doing what feels attractive at the moment. How can we deny our children those games, when they might be the <em>only</em> thing that still interests them?</p>
<p>The sensation that something is attractive or pleasant too has a role in the larger scheme of things. It's what the nature created to make us do what is good for us. But our industries have been able to separate that too from its purpose! Think, in the manner of a metaphor, about white sugar: the pleasurable substance has been extracted from the nutritious rest. We can now fool nature; we can add sugar (physically, and metaphorically) to virtually anything. We can make <em>anything</em> taste attractive!</p>
<p>But there's a hidden cost. (<em>Two</em> hidden costs, to be exact. We let you discover the other one on your own.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<h3><span id="The_economy_of_pleasure"></span>The economy of pleasure</h3>
<p>Around the time when William James was writing the above lines, Friedrich Nietzsche was looking at the course modernity was taking and jotting down notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sensibility immensely more irritable; the abundance of disparate impressions greater than ever; cosmopolitanism in food, literatures, newspapers, forms, tastes, even landscapes. The tempo of this influx prestissimo; the impressions erase each other; one instinctively resists taking in anything, taking anything deeply, to “digest” anything; a weakening of the power to digest results from this. A kind of adaptation to this flood of impressions takes place: men unlearn spontaneous action, they merely react to stimuli from outside. They spend their strength partly in assimilating things, partly in defense, partly in opposition. Profound weakening of spontaneity: The historian, critic, analyst, interpreter, the observer, the collector, the reader-all of them reactive talents-all science!</p>
<p>Artificial change of one’s nature into a “mirror”; interested but, as it were, merely epidermically interested; a coolness on principle, a balance, a fixed low temperature closely underneath the thin surface on which warmth, movement, “tempest,” and the play of waves are encountered.“</p>
<p>Opposition of external mobility and a certain deep heaviness and weariness.“</p></blockquote>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Interesting to observe that this was written before the radio, the TV, the worldwide travel, the computer and the mobile phone.</p>
<p>Imagine if this is really true! Imagine if we've been "pursuing happiness" by seeking stimulation – and sacrificing our very <em>ability</em> to feel!</p>
<p>We think about Nietzsche when we hear some of the music that young people listen to. It reminded us of doleful howls of some youngsters whose subtlety of feeling has been lost – created in an ardent effort to stimulate the overstimulated senses of their brethren <em>even</em> a bit further.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p><h2><span id="Knowledge_too_is_a_resource"></span>Knowledge too is a resource</h2></p>
<div><h3><span id="We.27ve_done_one_thing_right"></span>We've done one thing right</h3>
<p>In the midst of all systemic mishaps, one thing has been done right – the academic tenure. And the corresponding ethos of academic freedom.</p>
<p>We now have a global army, of people who have been selected and specially educated and publicly sponsored to think deeply and freely. Its task is to protect us from ignorance; to create  knowledge of highest standards, and make sure it prevails.</p>
<p>Is this army still trained and organized as it might empower it to fulfill its vitally important task – <em>in this age</em>? </p> 
<p>Max Weber – a <a href="http://www.knowledgefederation.org/index.php?title=Giants&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Giants (page does not exist)"><em>giant</em></a> of sociology – observed that the greatest progress in the art of warfare resulted from improvements in the social organization of warriors. Could it be similar also in our strife with ignorance?</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Do the work.</p><p>That's all the productivity advice you need, and the only <em>useful</em> productivity advice you're ever going to get. You can direct your attention to a million optimizations— email, meetings, notes, calendar, time tracking, goals, todo lists, time estimates, prioritization frameworks, quantified self sensors, analytics, apps, documents, journaling. But don't. Ignore all this, and do the work. When you do the work, everything else optimizes itself.</p><p>If the only thing you must do is the work, why is there so much productivity advice? Blog posts, courses, seminars, software? Because when there is demand, there is supply. Work is hard. People will latch onto anything to avoid doing it. The market is happy to oblige.</p><p>Work means sitting down, getting through that calculus chapter, and doing the exercises. No amount of productivity hacking will make that easier. You don't need pomodoro alarms, bullet journals, time tracking apps, animated explainer videos, or different color highlighters. Everyone doesn't learn differently. Everyone learns calculus in the same way— by doing the work. You need Rudin's book, a pen, paper, and time. More tools give you negative utility. They won't make the work go faster. But they will consume as much time as you are willing to waste.</p><p>Building a new startup? Same thing. Talk to users all day. Then sit down and write the code. Get others to join you. Repeat. People do new founders a disservice by constantly proselytizing how complex startups are. In one sense they are. But in another sense they're surprisingly simple. For a long time you're doing the same three things over and over. Sell. Code. Recruit. Then do it all over again tomorrow. Startups don't get built by watching startup advice videos on YouTube. They get built by doing the work. All you need is a laptop and a metrocard.</p><p>I read a lot of biographies. People who have biographies written about them have two things in common. First, they are obsessed. Second, they never stray from doing the work. John Carmack was obsessed with game engines. Orville and Wilbur Wright were obsessed with manned flight. Leonardo da Vinci was obsessed with the structure of things. So they would code, construct, and paint. That's not to say they did no meta thinking. Carmack published plan files, the Wright brothers maintained extensive correspondence detailing their experiments, and Leonardo da Vinci is known for his magnificent notebooks. But you'd be hard pressed to find them writing letters about writing letters. They were busy doing the work.</p><p>An important ingredient for doing the work is boredom. That's how I got into programming. School was boring. We had three channels of television, and they were almost always boring. I had computer games, but I sucked at gaming and games quickly got frustrating. I read all the books that we had laying around. The only thing left was BASIC. So I started there and never stopped. The simple reason is that programming computers was the most interesting activity around.</p><p>If boredom is a necessary ingredient, then portable internet is a disaster for doing the work. How are you supposed to get excited about anything if you're never bored? I don't know if I ever would have learned to program if I had modern internet. Why would I, if something more interesting was always a click away? This is true to this day. I can't get anything done when I'm online. There is always something on the internet that's locally more interesting or more important than writing the next paragraph, or threading a flag through a series of function calls, or reading a book. The only way I can get anything done is to turn the internet off.</p><p>So I do. I have a work computer, and a router with parental controls that blocks every possible internet distraction on it. No Twitter, no Hacker News, no YouTube. Router administration is set up so I can't make changes over WiFi. If I want to unblock something, I have to physically get to the router and plug in a cable to change the settings. I power off every other device. No silent mode, no do not disturb, no hibernation. Power off. Recently a reader suggested putting my phone in a <a href="https://amzn.to/3fmBx4n">kSafe</a> (thanks Robert!) It works great, and now I’m doing that too. All this constructs enough physical barriers between me and temptation that the internet loses and my laziness wins.</p><p>Then I get properly bored. And then I do the work.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>We want to know if things are fair. Do some groups of people tend to get a raw deal in company hiring or university admissions or court sentences?</p>

<p>There <em>seems</em> to be an obvious way to answer such questions: Get some data and “check” for bias. But different people often get different results, even when looking at the same data. What’s going on?</p>

<p>What’s going on is the whole strategy is <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/11/16/simpsons-paradox-and-the-tyranny-of-strata/">doomed</a>. It’s counterintuitive, but you usually <em>can’t</em> determine bias this way. The problem boils down to that in order to “check” for bias you must do something to your data called <em>stratification</em>. This can totally change the results, and there’s no single best way to do it.</p>



<p>Let’s do a thought experiment. You live in a city inhabited by blue people and red people. There are constant debates about if police are biased against either of these groups. Eventually, you decide to take action. You find 1024 blue men and 1024 red men, give each a suspicious looking stack of $20 bills and tell them to jog outside for an hour while holding the stack. Finally, you count the number that are arrested in each group.  (You have a <em>very</em> good relationship with your local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board">IRB</a>.)</p>



<p>So you run the experiment, and these are the results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>1024</td>
      <td>232</td>
      <td>280</td>
      <td>22.7</td>
      <td>27.3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>More reds were arrested than blues. Does this show police bias against reds?</p>



<p>You show your data to a friend. She notices that the blue men in your population were more often old (over 35) while the red men were more often young (35 or less). In particular, your data has these demographics:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>384</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>640</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>She re-does your analysis separately for young and old men. The results are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>84</td>
      <td>44</td>
      <td>13.1</td>
      <td>11.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>640</td>
      <td>148</td>
      <td>236</td>
      <td>38.5</td>
      <td>36.9</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now this suggests a bias against <em>blue</em> men. The police arrest young blue men more often than young red men, and similarly for the old. The reason the previous analysis suggested a bias against red men is that more of them are young.</p>

<p>Does this now show that the police are biased against blues?</p>



<p>Your friend pokes at the data some more. She points out that reds are more likely to live in Riverview, while blues are more likely to live in Pineway. Specifically, you have these demographics:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>neighborhood</th>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Pineway</td>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>128</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pineway</td>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>256</td>
      <td>256</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Riverview</td>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>256</td>
      <td>256</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Riverview</td>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>384</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>She re-does the analysis for each location / age group. These are the results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>neighborhood</th>
      <th>age</th>
      <th>blue total</th>
      <th>red total</th>
      <th>blue arrested</th>
      <th>red arrested</th>
      <th>% blue arrested</th>
      <th>% red arrested</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Pineway</td>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>70</td>
      <td>26</td>
      <td>18.2</td>
      <td>20.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pineway</td>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>256</td>
      <td>256</td>
      <td>110</td>
      <td>114</td>
      <td>43.0</td>
      <td>44.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Riverview</td>
      <td>old</td>
      <td>256</td>
      <td>256</td>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>5.5</td>
      <td>7.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Riverview</td>
      <td>young</td>
      <td>128</td>
      <td>384</td>
      <td>38</td>
      <td>122</td>
      <td>29.7</td>
      <td>31.8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In each age-location group, reds were more often arrested than blues. The difference from the previous analysis is that blues tend to live in Pineway, and police more often arrest people in Pineway.</p>

<p>This suggests a bias against reds. But, given how things have changed in the past, something feels off…</p>



<p>Sweating, you ask your friend, “<em>Now</em> are we done?”</p>

<p>She says, “Almost! I just noticed that clothing seems to be a factor! Reds tend to wear joggers while blues tend to wear shorts. Just give me a second…”</p>

<p>She re-does the analysis yet again, with the following results.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>attire</th>
      <th>neighborhood</th>
      <th>age</th>

      <td>46.9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>joggers</td>

      <td>34.4</td>
      <td>34.4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now, the percentages are exactly the same in each group. The police tend to arrest young men in Pineway wearing joggers. They tend not to arrest old men in Riverview wearing shorts. All the racial differences you saw before might be due to correlations between race and age, neighborhood, and attire, not because of race <em>itself</em>.</p>



<p>You tell your friend “Well done! You’ve resolved it. It’s getting late, I think I’ll be going…”</p>

<p>As you edge towards the door she says “Yeah, goodnight, let’s do this again! But before you leave, I did notice that some people wear headphones and some don’t…”</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with Simpson’s paradox, this is all basically an example of a <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/11/16/simpsons-paradox-and-the-tyranny-of-strata/">“recursive” Simpson’s paradox</a>.</p>



<p>What went “wrong” in this experiment? Suppose you gather data on police interactions with people of a single race. No one would be surprised if the statistics are different with respect to the young vs. old or urban vs. rural or rich vs. poor or churchgoers vs. nonreligious. It would be surprising if there <em>weren’t</em> differences.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to use observational data to prove police are biased against red people. To do this, you need to split up all red and blue people into subgroups (“strata”) in such a way that each subgroup of red people is “exactly the same” as the corresponding subgroup, except for their race.</p>

<p>This is basically an impossible task. Human beings are complicated and multidimensional. To a first approximation, <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/10/08/police-violence-your-ratios-dont-prove-what-you-think-they-prove/">race is correlated with everything</a>. There’s just too many attributes to firmly establish that <em>any</em> observed difference is really due to race and not to something else that’s correlated with race. However much you try to split people up, there will still be remaining differences between each “red group” and each “blue group” you haven’t accounted for. For the same reason, you can’t use observational data to prove there <em>isn’t</em> bias.</p>

<p>If you want to measure fairness, you need to <em>intervene</em>. We’ll discuss that more next time.</p>

November 23, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being an engineer at heart, each time I see a company write about their tech stack, I brew a fresh cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy reading the newfound little treat.</p><p>There’s just something fascinating about getting to know what’s under the hood of other people’s businesses. It’s like gossip, but about software.</p><p>A couple of months ago I started working on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/why-panelbear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another private analytics service</a>, a project which has gone through numerous iterations, and I feel lucky that 400+ websites have already integrated with it, even though it's still in the early stages.</p><p>That’s why, in the same spirit as Jake Lazaroff’s <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tools and Services I Use to Run My SaaS</a>, I thought it’s now my turn to do a short write up of the technologies I’m using to run this new service.</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Over the years I have added many programming languages to my toolbelt, but for solo projects I have converged to two in particular that strike a good balance of productivity and reliability.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a>: Most of the backend code is in Python. Which has enabled me to ship features incredibly fast. Additionally, I use <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mypy</a> for optional type hints, which helps keep the codebase manageable.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typescript</a>: I used to avoid working on the frontend as much as I could. That is until I discovered Typescript about 4 years ago. It just makes the whole experience a lot better, and I now use it for all my projects together with React.</p></li></ul><h2>Frameworks and libraries</h2><p>This list could have been huge, as I stand on the shoulders of giants who have published the vast amount of open-source code which I rely on. But I'd like to highlight only a handful due to their major role in the stack:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Django</a>: It's like a superpower for solo developers. The longer you work in this industry, the more you appreciate not having to reinvent the wheel for the 100th time. A monolithic framework can get you <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really</a>, <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really</a> <a href="https://djangostars.com/blog/10-popular-sites-made-on-django/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far</a>. To me, it's about predictable software that's fast in every way that matters. In case you're interested, I talk more about this topic on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose Boring Technology</a>.</li><li><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a>: The web app for the dashboards is built using React + Webpack. After using Angular for a long time, I switched to React because it's just a pluggable view layer that doesn't get in the way. I use the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/Frojd/django-react-templatetags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">django-react-templatetags</a> to embed the React components in my Django templates.</li><li><a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextJS</a>: I use it for the landing pages, documentation and the blog which you are currently reading. It enables me to re-use various React components, and still reap the performance and SEO benefits of a statically generated site.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celery</a>: I use it for any kind of background/scheduled tasks. It does have a learning curve for more advanced use-cases, but it's quite reliable once you understand how it works, and more importantly when it fails.</li><li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap 4</a>: I built a custom theme on top of Bootstrap. It has saved me a lot of time, and there's lots of documentation around it. That's why I picked it.</li></ul><h2>Databases</h2><p>I originally stored all data in a single SQLite database, doing backups meant making a copy of this file to an object storage like S3. At the time, it was more than enough for the small sites I tested Panelbear with. But as I added more features and websites, I needed more specialized software to support those features:</p><ul><li><a href="https://clickhouse.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickhouse</a>: I believe this is one of those technologies that over time will become ubiquitous. It's honestly a fantastic piece of software that enabled me to build features that initially seemed impossible on low-cost hardware. I do intend to write a future blog post on some lessons learned from running Clickhouse on Kubernetes. So stay tuned!</li><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a>: My go-to relational database. Sane defaults, battle-tested, and deeply integrated with Django. For Panelbear, I use it for all application data that is not analytics related. For the analytics data, I instead wrote a simple interface for querying Clickhouse within Django.</li><li><a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis</a>: I use it for many things: caching, rate-limiting, as a task queue, and as a key/value store with TTL for various features. Rock-solid, and great documentation.</li></ul><h2>Deployment</h2><p>I treat my infrastructure as <a href="https://joachim8675309.medium.com/devops-concepts-pets-vs-cattle-2380b5aab313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cattle instead of pets</a>, things like servers and clusters are meant to come and go. So if one server gets "sick", I just replace it with another one. That means everything is described as code in a git repo, and I do not change things by SSH'ing into the servers. You can think of it like a template to clone my entire infrastructure with one command into any AWS region/environment.</p><p>This also helps me in case of disaster recovery. I just run a few commands, and some minutes later my stack has been re-created. This was particularly useful when I moved from DigitalOcean, to Linode, and recently to AWS. Everything is described in code, so it's easy to keep track of what components I own, even years later (all companies have some AWS IAM policy or VPC subnet lurking around which was created via clicky-clicky on the UI, and now everyone depends on it).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a>: I manage most of my cloud infrastructure with Terraform. Things like EKS clusters, S3 buckets, roles, and RDS instances are declared in my Terraform manifests. The state is synced to an encrypted S3 bucket to avoid getting in trouble in case something happens to my development laptop.</li><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a>: I build everything as Docker images. Even stateful components like Clickhouse or Redis are packaged and shipped as Docker containers to my cluster. It also makes my stack very portable, as I can run it anywhere I can run Docker.</li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>: Allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously. However, I wouldn’t bindly recommend it to everyone, as I already felt comfortable working with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. I also rely on managed offerings, which helps reduce the burden too.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a>: Normally I’d use <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a> in the past (which is also great), but for this project I prefer to use GitHub Actions as it removes yet another service which needs to have access to my repositories, and deployment secrets. However, CircleCI has plenty of good features, and I still recommend it.</li></ul><h2>Infrastructure</h2><p>I started in a single $5/mo instance in DigitalOcean, then moved to the managed Kubernetes offering as I was reinventing the wheel for a lot of things Kubernetes already gives me out of the box (service discovery, TLS certs, load balancing, log rotation, rollout, scaling, fault-tolerance, among others).</p><p>Unfortunately, I had <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/kubernetes-unable-to-connect-to-the-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliability issues</a> with DigitalOcean's Kubernetes offering, even on larger instances. The cluster API would often go down randomly and no longer recover, this disrupted a lot of cluster services including the load balancer, which translated into downtime for me. I had to create a new cluster each time this happened, and while Terraform made it trivial, this was not something that inspired a lot of confidence about their managed service. I suspect their control plane was underprovisioned, which would be kind of understandable given the price tag.</p><p>Unfortunately I was not able to resolve the issue after several weeks. That's why I decided to move to <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linode</a>, and had exactly 0 problems during the 1.5 month-long honeymoon that followed.</p><p>However, I recently moved once again, this time to AWS due to a pretty good deal I received. It also enabled me to use managed services like RDS to offload managing PostgreSQL, which is a big plus. What made all these migrations relatively easy, was that all my infrastructure was described via Terraform and Kubernetes manifests. The migrations essentially consisted of an evening, some tea, and patience. But that's for another post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS</a>: Predictable, and lots of managed services. However, I use it at my full-time job, so I didn't have to spend too much time figuring things out. The main services I use are EKS, ELB, S3, RDS, IAM and private VPCs. I might also add Cloudfront and Kinesis in the future.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a>: I mainly use it for DDoS protection, serving DNS, and offloading edge caching of various static assets (currently shaves off 80% of the egress charges from AWS - their bandwidth pricing is insane!).</li><li><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>: Free SSL certificate authority. I use cert-manager in my Kubernetes cluster to automatically issue and renew certificates based on my ingress rules.</li><li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a>: My domain name registrar of choice. Allows MFA for login which is an important security feature. Unlike other registrars, they haven't surprised me with an expensive renewal every few years. I like them.</li></ul><h2>Kubernetes components</h2><p>The following components automate most of the devops work for me. I use several others too, but some of the main ones I use are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-nginx</a>: Rock-solid ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy, and load balancer. Sits behind the NLB which controls ingress to the cluster nodes.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cert-manager</a>: Automatically issue/renew TLS certs as defined in my ingress rules.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">external-dns</a>: Synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers (such as Cloudflare).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prometheus-operator</a>: Automatically monitors most of my services, and exposes dashboards via Grafana.</li><li><a href="https://fluxcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flux</a>: GitOps way to do continuous delivery in Kubernetes. Basically pulls and deploys new Docker images when I release them.</li></ul><h2>CLI tools</h2><p>There’s plenty here, but frequently used include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubectl</a>: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster to watch logs, pods and services, SSH into a running container, and so on.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/wercker/stern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stern</a>: Multi pod log tailing for Kubernetes. Really handy.</li><li><a href="https://htop.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">htop</a>: Interactive system process viewer. Better than “top” if you ask me.</li><li><a href="https://curl.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cURL</a>: Issue HTTP requests locally, inspect headers.</li><li><a href="https://httpie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTPie</a>: Like cURL, but simpler for JSON APIs.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rakyll/hey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hey</a>: Load testing HTTP endpoints. Gives a nice latency distribution summary.</li></ul><h2>Monitoring</h2><ul><li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>: Efficient storage of time series data for monitoring. Tracks all the cluster and app metrics. It was a lot cheaper than using Cloudwatch for app metrics.</li><li><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana</a>: Nice dashboards for the Prometheus monitoring data. All dashboards are described in JSON files and versioned in the …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jamstack is a new architectural approach with the core principle of pre-rendering aiming to make web applications to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run faster,</li>
<li>be more secure,</li>
<li>be easier to scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that achieved with the use of many modern tools to bring productivity to the maximum. Sounds interesting right? This approach is gaining a lot of popularity which makes a market for new tooling supporting the Jamstack approach. RedwoodsJS is one of the new shining stars, its team believes that JAMstack is a huge leap forward in web development and they are doing their best to make it even more pleasant to work with.</p>
<h2>RedwoodJS</h2>
<p>Redwood is an open-source project initiated by <strong>Tom Preston-Werner, the co-founder of GitHub &amp; creator of Jekyll</strong> - one of the first static site generators. So what is Redwood?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imagine a React frontend, statically delivered by CDN, that talks via GraphQL to your backend running on AWS Lambdas around the world, all deployable with just a git push—that’s Redwood.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>RedwoodJS is a highly opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework that aims to make building and deploying JAMstack apps as easy as possible. </p>
<h2>The stack</h2>
<p>RedwoodJS uses some of the most popular cutting-edge technologies and by giving up the freedom of choosing your tech stack, you are gaining a significant reduction of the level of complexity of setting up all services to make your infrastructure work as intended:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong> - this part is covered by React supported by Apollo and it has a lot of code generators involved which let you create everything i.e. routes, pages, cells (even with already pre-configured tests) out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Backend</strong> - it’s becoming difficult to talk about cutting-edge technologies without putting GraphQL into the equation. Redwood uses Prisma for its GraphQL backend, enabling quick creation of backends with graphical interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - Redwood’s development team has support for several deployment targets on their roadmap with a top-priority to make deployment strategies in a way that makes it easy for additional targets to be added, as well as to make it easy to adjust to user’s own deployment strategy. Right now it offers out of the box deployment to Netlify and Vercel, with AWS and Google Cloud Run high on their road map.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concepts &amp; features</h2>
<p>Redwood features a lot of new interesting concepts as well as brings a breath of fresh air to well-known ones. One of the most interesting ones are definitely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cells</strong> - they are one of the signature modes of abstraction in Redwood. Cells represent a declarative approach to data fetching which creates space (by providing conventions around data fetching) in between the request and the response which Redwood can utilize to perform its optimizations. All of this without writing a line of imperative code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not a 1.0 version</h2>
<p>RedwoodJS software has not reached a stable version 1.0 yet.
Its team put Redwood in the later stages of the “make it work” phase in the “make it work; make it right; make it fast” paradigm. Although this makes it not suitable for production use, Redwood is a concept that is definitely worth following.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<![CDATA[How to build a proxy application for the new AWS Gateway Load Balancer]]>

November 23, 2020 | https://www.sentiatechblog.com/geneveproxy-an-aws-gateway-load-balancer-reference-application | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sentiatechblog.com/geneveproxy-an-aws-gateway-load-balancer-reference-application">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--## GeneveProxy - an AWS Gateway Load Balancer reference application -->
<p>The AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) allows AWS users to route VPC traffic through a centralized appliance. This appliance can perform monitoring, throttling and deep packet inspection. To achieve this, the appliance needs to support Geneve encapsulation and decapsulation. In this post we will provide a blueprint for a Python application with full Geneve support.</p>
<p>Reading the AWS Gateway Load Balancer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/gateway-load-balancer/">product page</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/introduction.html">documentation</a>, you will find that the product is strongly marketed towards third-party appliances. In other words, you purchase an appliance from a third-party vendor (often at a hefty price) and use their product to monitor and inspect your traffic. But as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig">Corey Quinn</a> wrote in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/what-i-dont-get-about-the-aws-gateway-load-balancer/">his post</a> “What I Don’t Get about the AWS Gateway Load Balancer”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A (very!) careful reading of the documentation indicates that you aren’t required to go cross-account with these devices, and that there’s no requirement that the appliances actually be third party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this article I have built exactly that: a first party application, written in Python, which receives traffic from the GWLB, decapsulates the packet, inspects the packet, re-encapsulates it and returns it to the GWLB. The application is called GeneveProxy, and its full source code can be found on the Github <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sentialabs/geneve-proxy">GeneveProxy project page</a>. Any code in this article is taken directly from this project. The purpose of this application is to provide a reference on how to process Geneve headers and how to interact with the AWS Gateway Load Balancer.</p>
<p>In the article below we will describe the full process of routing, encapsulation and packet inspection. We will do this by following an example packet from a source EC2 instance, through PrivateLink, to the GWLB, to the appliance, back to the GWLB and PrivateLink, and out to the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/6iysA8pOA9MnruSIYjHNXN/59f0c728a130fa204804eb8854a3f595/overview.png?fit=scale&amp;w=920" alt="Overview"></p>
<p>I will not go into how to build the infrastructure, because this is pretty well documented on the Gateway Load Balancer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> page.</p>
<h3>Packets and headers</h3>
<p>When the source EC2 instance executes a <code>GET http://google.com</code>, a new packet is sent out on the wire (1). This packet consists of the HTTP request with a TCP header and an IPv4 header:</p>
<pre><code>IPv4 Header
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|Version| IHL=5 |    DSCP   |ECN|        Total Length=76        |

<p>The route tables for the source EC2 instance determine this packet needs to be routed to the public internet. The route tables have been configured to forward this traffic to the PrivateLink endpoint for the Gateway Load Balancer.</p>
<p>When the packet arrives at the GWLB, it adds three additional headers. First the Geneve header, then an UDP header, and finally an outer IPv4 header. Then the packet is put on the wire again (3). The new headers direct the traffic towards the Appliance EC2 instance:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The stack above is the exact packet that arrives at the appliance.</p>
<h3>Receiving raw packets with Python</h3>
<p>The AWS article <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/integrate-your-custom-logic-or-appliance-with-aws-gateway-load-balancer/">Integrate your custom logic or appliance with AWS Gateway Load Balancer</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the appliance intends to forward the packet, it must do the following: […] swap the source and destination IP addresses in outer IPv4 header (i.e. Source IP = appliance IP address. Destination IP = GWLB IP address) […] update the IP checksum in outer IPv4 header.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be able to do this, we need to access the raw IP headers. When you create a normal UDP socket, like so:</p>
<pre><code>bind_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
bind_sock.bind((UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
</code></pre>
<p>You will only receive the data after the UDP header (the Geneve header will be at byte 0). To overcome this, we create a raw socket instead (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sentialabs/geneve-proxy/blob/dda14347befb60c490e433f807c1a6cb256d6e4d/main.py#L21-L25">GitHub link</a>):</p>
<pre><code>geneve_sock = socket.socket(
    socket.AF_INET,
    socket.SOCK_RAW,
    socket.IPPROTO_UDP
)
</code></pre>
<p>This socket will receive all UDP data directed to the appliance EC2 instance, so it’s up to us to only process packets arriving at the Geneve port (6081).</p>

As you can see I have this blog: <a href="https://paulie.dev/">https://paulie.dev</a> and a commercial portfolio: <a href="https://www.pauliescanlon.io/">https://www.pauliescanlon.io</a></p><p>Both sites are built on top of my Gatsby theme: <a href="https://gatsby-theme-terminal.netlify.app/">gatsby-theme-terminal</a> which is Open source and can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-theme-terminal">GitHub</a></p><p>Using a Gatsby Theme solves one of my issues as I'm able to have two sites that look and work pretty much the same way and any changes I make to the theme are inherited by both my sites. It's kind of like managing your own multi brand design system, but just for yourself.</p><p>There was one other problem though. 🤔</p><p>I wanted both sites to have the same "intro" section, but every time I made a change to one I had to make the same change to the other site to ensure they were both displaying the same intro text.</p><p>This might be fine if I weren't a developer but doing something twice is one time too many IMO.</p><p>It was also a little frustrating because I also wanted my Twitter profile description to be in sync with both the sites so, again another place to remember to update my personal blurb.</p><p>One option I considered would have been to hook up a Content Management System, and this would have been fine and it would have kept both my sites in sync but it wouldn't have been able to update my Twitter profile blurb...</p><p>So, I've decided to reverse engineer the Twitter API and use that as a CMS to populate both my sites. The idea is quite simple. I'll use the Twitter profile description as though it were a field from a CMS. Naturally any changes I make to this will appear on my Twitter profile and below is how I pull that same info into both of my sites.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p>Here's what I'll be showing you how to build:</p><ul><li>App / API <a href="https://gatsby-netlify-twitter.netlify.app/">https://gatsby-netlify-twitter.netlify.app</a></li><li>GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter">https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter</a></li></ul><p>... but the actual API I use for my blog and site is here: <a href="https://paulie-api.netlify.app/">https://paulie-api.netlify.app</a></p><h2>Tech</h2><h3>Netlify Functions</h3><p>"Power your site without managing servers" is how Netlify describe Functions and for all intents and purposes thats exactly what they are. Similar to how you might create an <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app and deploy it somewhere but without the hassle of having to setup server side environments and more crucially any really dweeby server uptime monitoring.</p><h3>Twitter API v2</h3><p>A set of endpoints that can be used to get data from Twitter. Any Twitter requests must be done server side and use a set of keys and tokens. You can't unfortunately hit the Twitter API from the browser so we need a "server" or as mentioned above, a Netlify Function</p><p>Using both of the above i've made my own API endpoint which goes off and hits the Twitter API and returns my Profile information which I can then display in the intro section of my blog and site. I've deployed this API to Netlify and it's completely de-coupled from either of my sites but will return data which can be fetched from client side "fetch" request from within my site and blog. That url again is here: <a href="https://paulie-api.netlify.app/">https://paulie-api.netlify.app</a></p><h2>Before we start</h2><p>Before we get started there's a couple of things you'll need to have in place.</p><h3>Twitter API v2</h3><p>Apply for access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api">Twitter API</a>. This is quite a lengthy process so strap in and also bookmark this post as it might take a few days for Twitter to accept your application.</p><p>Once you have access you can head over to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard">Developer Portal</a> and create a new project, and within the project you can create an "app", I called mine "paulie-api".</p><p>In here you'll find all the API keys and tokens required to access the Twitter API. Make a note of them somewhere as we'll be using them later.</p><h3>Netlify CLI</h3><p>To run Netlify Functions we'll be using <code>netlify dev</code> rather than <code>gatsby develop</code> or <code>yarn develop</code> so you'll need to install the <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/">Netlify CLI</a></p><h2>The Build</h2><p>In order to develop you own API I found it easiest to have some kind of "site" running at the same time which will access the API endpoint and render the response on the page. In the demo repo you'll see i've set up a really simple Gatsby Site with one page that uses "fetch" to, er fetch and then render the data.</p><p>I've used <a href="https://theme-ui.com/home">Theme UI</a> for the style but naturally you can choose whatever you like to do this.</p><p>Whether you're starting from scratch or adding Netlify Functions to an existing project you'll need to start by adding a <code>functions</code> dir to the root of your project.</p><hr><pre><p><span>|</span><span>-- functions</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span>-- package.json</span></p><p><span></span><span>|</span><span>-- src</span></p><p><span>package.json</span></p></pre><hr><p><code>functions</code> is kind of it's own application so it'll need it's own <code>package.json</code> and will have one dependency on <a href="https://github.com/HunterLarco/twitter-v2">twitter-v2</a></p><hr><pre><p><span></span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gatsby-netlify-twitter-api"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"description"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"An api for the Twitter v2 api"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"test"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"keywords"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>""</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"license"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"ISC"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"twitter-v2"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^0.1.2"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre><hr><p>Next have a look at <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter/blob/main/.env.example">.env.example</a>.

Naturally you'll want to change the <code>GATSBY_TWITTER_USERNAME</code> to your own Twitter username and the Twitter keys and tokens will be what I referenced earlier which are provided by the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="run-command-in-a-pod">Run command in a pod</h3>
<p>It can be useful to execute some command inside running pod, for example see generated nginx's config</p>
<pre><code>
kubectl <span>exec</span> nginx-ingress-controller-j1xvs cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

kubectl <span>exec</span> my-pod -- df -h</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>-it</code> (interactive and tty) for interactive commands as bash, irb, top:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl <span>exec</span> -it my-pod-name bash

kubectl <span>exec</span> -it my-rails-app rails c</code></pre>
<h3 id="update-image-version-via-cli">Update image version via cli</h3>
<pre><code>kubectl <span>set</span> image deployment &lt;deployment-name&gt; &lt;container-name&gt;=new_image:img_version --record

kubectl <span>set</span> image deployment sample-app-deployment sample_app=midtrans/sample-app:<span>$PKG_VERSION</span> -n=my-namespace --record</code></pre>
<h3 id="edit-kubernete-resources">Edit kubernete resources</h3>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl edit my-deployment</code></pre>
<p>It will open text editor with current definition of your resource, Default editor is <code>vi</code>, in case it's not your favorite one you may change it:</p>
<pre><code>KUBE_EDITOR=<span>"nano"</span> kubectl edit svc/my-service</code></pre>
<p>Or make your choice permanent by adding to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code></p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> KUBE_EDITOR=<span>"atom --wait"</span> 
<span>export</span> KUBE_EDITOR=<span>"mate -w"</span> 
<span>export</span> KUBE_EDITOR=<span>"nano"</span> 
<span>export</span> KUBE_EDITOR=<span>"subl --wait"</span> </code></pre>
<p>Also can control it with system-wide editor setting <code>$EDITOR</code></p>
<h3 id="save-k8s-objects-to-file">Save k8s objects to file</h3>
<p>Save resource as yaml:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl get deployment my-app -o yaml &gt; my-app-deployment.yaml</code></pre>
<p>Show resource as json with syntax highlight:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl get deployment my-app -o yaml | jq</code></pre>
<h3 id="show-latest-logs-from-pod">Show latest logs from pod</h3>
<p>Show last 100 lines and add new lines in real time (similar to <code>tail -f ...</code>)</p>
<pre><code>kubectl logs my-pod-name --tail 100 --follow</code></pre>
<p>Show logs from previous container (eg when it was crashed and restarted)</p>
<pre><code>kubectl logs my-pod-name --tail 100 --previous</code></pre>
<h3 id="get-running-resources">Get running resources</h3>
<p>Show all pods, services, deployments, replicasets, cronjobs, deamonsets and jobs</p>
<pre><code>kubectl get all</code></pre>
<h3 id="kubectl-auto-complete">Kubectl auto-complete</h3>
<p>Very useful, find it on <a href="https://kuber.host/docs/installing_kubectl#autocomplete">kubectl page</a></p>
<h3 id="kubectl-shell-prompt">Kubectl shell prompt</h3>
<p>It can show you current k8s cluster and namespace, take it from here: <a href="https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1">https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1</a></p>
<p>How to use it:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>source</span> <span>$ZSH</span>/plugins/kube-ps1/kube-ps2.zsh
KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_COLOR=null
KUBE_PS1_CTX_COLOR=green
KUBE_PS1_SEPARATOR=<span>''</span>
KUBE_PS1_PREFIX=<span>'  '</span>
KUBE_PS1_SUFFIX=<span>''</span></code></pre>
<p>Result:
<br>
<img src="https://kuber.host/images/docs/kubectl-prompt.png"></p>
<h3 id="watch-pod-changes">Watch pod changes</h3>
<p>To make list of pods interactive, add <code>-w</code>: (it will add lines bellow for every change of pods' status)</p>
<pre><code>kubectl get pods -w</code></pre>
<p>To have <code>top</code>-like interactivity, we can use <code>watch</code> utility:  (works with any command at all, e.g. <code>date</code>)</p>
<pre><code>watch kubectl get pods</code></pre>
<h3 id="set-namespace-for-session">Set namespace for session</h3>
<p>Save it as default namespace to current config fil and e</p>
<pre><code>kubectl config <span>set</span>-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=sample-app</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-kubectl-proxy">Using <code>kubectl proxy</code></h3>
<p>It will run a local web-server and make services in cluster accessible, run it with:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl proxy --port=8080</code></pre>
<p>Then can access kubernetes dashboard in browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/YOUR-NAMESPACE/services/SERVICE-NAME:80/proxy">http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/YOUR-NAMESPACE/services/SERVICE-NAME:80/proxy</a></p>

                        <div>


    <div>

                    <p>Game design is such a wide and varied discipline that job titles in the field have become increasingly granular over the years – and ever since we started working on our debut title Lacuna, I've become more and more convinced that "detective game designer" merits its own denomination as well. Detective gameplay (or "investigation gameplay") poses a number of unique challenges centered around two main problems: the <strong>struggle between story and puzzles</strong> (or "cases") as well as <strong>communication between the player and the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Since some of the explanations will be using our own game as an example, let me give you a quick rundown: Lacuna is a story-driven adventure with platformer controls and investigation elements. Its four fundamental gameplay types are dialogs (with choices), moving around, examining objects, and solving puzzles. All of them are staples of the point &amp; click genre, but their execution is quite unique; I don't want to go into more detail here because it's not pertinent to the topic, but you can <a href="http://lacuna.game/">check out the game on Steam</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p><img alt="Gameplay" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/gameplay-movement.gif"><br>
<em>This is what the game looks like</em></p>
<h2>Story vs. puzzles</h2>
<p>A handful of abstract game design principles lie at Lacuna's core. For instance, "no takebacks" dictates that the player only get one shot at every decision, dialog, and puzzle. The game auto-saves and doesn't allow you to go back if you performed poorly or regret an earlier decision. There's also "limited feedback", which means that the player often isn't told immediately whether a solution was correct and what the consequences of their actions and decisions will be.</p>
<p>However, there's one in particular I want to highlight here because it concerns the above mentioned divide between story and puzzling in detective games: <strong>No getting stuck.</strong></p>
<p>The thought process behind it was simple: In games with both a story and puzzles (e.g. most P&amp;C games), story progress is almost always tied directly to puzzle progress. Until you solve the puzzle at hand, you don't get to see the next part of the story. For some players, especially those most interested in the story, this can become a problem. If they're stuck for too long, there's a chance they'll just drop out and never pick the game up again. Even if that doesn't happen, hard puzzles always run the risk of messing up the story's pacing and interrupting your immersion in the game – because you're becoming frustrated or, even worse, because you decide to tab out and Google the solution. To avoid people getting stuck, we considered a number of solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Make the puzzles very easy?</strong><br>
This isn't our favorite since it somewhat defeats the purpose of puzzles. They'd still play a role as a change of pace now and then, but if puzzles aren't a little hard, nobody will feel like a detective solving them. Some early puzzles in Lacuna are easy, but most aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Provide hints?</strong><br>
Hint systems can be found in many adventures featuring puzzles. Unfortunately, they often take the player out of the experience in one of three ways: In some cases, the hint is provided by extradiegetic UI (e.g. in the pause menu) and therefore seems to come out of nowhere in the game world. In other cases, the player character is the one giving the hint, disconnecting the player from their avatar’s perspective. The third option of NPCs providing hints is a little better; however, it is often hard to justify <em>why</em> an NPC would be able to point the player in the right direction without possessing the rest of the solution to the ongoing puzzle (and why they didn't volunteer it in the first place). The two types of (sort-of) hint systems we went with in Lacuna are <em>Highlight Mode</em>, which displays optional outlines around objects and NPCs that hold new information, and <em>redundant information</em>, meaning that sometimes the player is given two ways of obtaining an important clue.</p>
<p><img alt="Hints" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-hints.png"><br>
<em>"YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW"</em></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Decouple story progress from puzzle progress?</strong><br>
Why not simply make a story-driven game throughout which the player can solve the occasional puzzle if they feel like it? Well, because it would require that puzzles be somewhat detached from the story. As a result, they run the risk of feeling meaningless since solving them is not rewarding and failing is not punishing. However, this <em>can</em> work quite well when combined with...</p>
<p><strong>Solution 4: Make branching content for different solutions?</strong><br>
Instead of impeding the player’s progress, wrong or missing puzzle solutions could lead to a less desirable continuation and/or outcome of the story. Unfortunately, creating a new story branch for each and every wrong solution to a puzzle is hardly feasible. However, there are less extreme ways of realizing this. For instance, the game could account for the player’s <em>overall</em> puzzling performance at certain points in the game, e.g. trigger the “good” finale to an act if they got more than x% of the puzzles right, and the “bad” one if not. There could also be cascading consequences of sorts, e.g. solving one case correctly may give the player an edge in a later one. These approaches have similar downsides as optional puzzles do, but to a lesser degree; puzzle success no longer being required for progress makes them feel more detached from the story and removes immediate feedback. Regardless, we have found this to be the best solution, which is why we employ it quite a bit in Lacuna (while trying to avoid all the pitfalls). By the way, if all of this is becoming too abstract for you, bear with us! The second half of this post is all about a real example from the game.</p>
<p><img alt="Detroit: Become Human" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-branching-content.jpg"><br>
<em>Detroit: Become Human offers an astonishing number of different outcomes depending on player action, but not everybody has that kind of money to burn</em></p>
<p>Despite all of these measures being taken to make sure that the player won't get stuck, Lacuna can still be called a hard game. While it's not difficult to get <em>to</em> the end, it's pretty difficult to get a <em>good</em> ending and not mess things up on your way there. In other words, rushing through the whole story is possible if you don't mind bringing it to a terrible conclusion.</p>
<h2>Communicating with the game</h2>
<p>While the previous chapter only concerns detective games that also prominently feature a story, this next one is relevant to pretty much every detective game every made. It addresses the topic of communication between the player and the game, and especially how the player can express their thoughts to it. Several principles have proven to make for a good experience across countless approaches to this problem over the years:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Many channels out, few channels back in.</strong><br>
If the game conveys information to the player on many different channels and in many different ways, the process of piecing the solution together tends to feel more interesting and rewarding. In Lacuna, the player picks up clues from dialogs, objects, environments, the news, and e-mails (with all sorts of attachments). At the same time, the channels via which the player communicates that solution back to the game are kept to a minimum, namely cloze texts we like to call "Case Sheets" and (to a lesser degree) dialog choices. Having one or two central mechanics for player input makes the experience more coherent and transparent and facilitates designing the mysteries around it.</p>
<p><img alt="Obra Dinn" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-obra-dinn.jpg"><br>
<em>Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope provides a bunch of different sources of information, but just one central mechanic for the player to communicate back to the game</em></p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Have the player communicate only the solution.</strong><br>
It is near impossible to create a system through which the player communicates to the game <em>how</em> they arrived at a solution. Luckily, this is not necessary. A well-designed puzzle provides all the information, then moves the entire solution process solely <em>into the player’s head</em>, and finally prompts the player to input only their answer. The player’s objective should be stated clearly, but in a very general way at the start of a case (e.g. “find the culprit”).</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Give the player maximum freedom in communicating the solution.</strong><br>
The way in which the player communicates the answer to the game is the most crucial part to get right. One aspect is to give the player many choices (or a large combination of choices) to pick from. Two things should be avoided: 1. Giving the player a high probability to succeed by picking a random answer. 2. Making it easy for the player to guess correctly because only one or a few of the available answers appear plausible. An example for a bad solution like this would be to give the player three dialog choices to solve the puzzle; even worse would be if one of them obviously made the most sense. A better approach would be to give the player a cloze text with a bunch of plausible options for each gap. Another possibility is to have the solution be an unguessable string of characters that the player needs to enter manually. Both ideas utilize combinatorial explosion to make guessing and brute-forcing nearly impossible.</p>
<p><img alt="Detective Grimoire" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-case-sheets.jpg"><br>
<em>Good luck brute-forcing your way through Detective Grimoire's cloze texts</em></p>
<h2>Puzzle example</h2>
<p>Hopefullly all this will become crystal clear when put to concrete use! The following is an early level in Lacuna. It doesn't contain some of the difficulties added later (like a large number of channels communicating potential evidence). In harder cases, the player will need to have paid attention to testimonies, news articles etc. from earlier levels to arrive at the correct conclusion, and some cases span multiple levels. Not this one, though; all the information required to solve it is directly contained in the clues and dialogs of the one level where it starts and ends.</p>
<p>This chapter won't reveal much of importance about the story, but it will spoil the solution to this one puzzle, so consider yourself warned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A primitive data type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support. When it comes to framework design, primitive types often refer to the basic building blocks, allowing more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed. Examples such as <code>ndarray</code> in Numpy, <code>tensor</code> in Tensorflow: when writing a Numpy or Tensorflow program, the main object manipulated and passed around is those primitive data types.<a id="more"></a></p><p>What is the primitive data type in Jina then? To many readers and users of Jina, <a href="https://101.jina.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concept of</a> <code>Executor</code>, <code>Driver</code>, <code>Pea</code>, <code>Pod</code>, <code>Flow</code> should be very familiar. They <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/02/Layer-of-Abstraction-when-Building-Tensorflow-for-Search/" title="define different abstraction layers">define different abstraction layers</a>, and together they compose the neural search design patterns. Thanks to these Jina idioms, one can quickly bootstrap a cross/multi-modality search system in no time. But are they primitive data types? No. Before <code>v0.8</code>, Jina has <em>no</em> primitive data type: drivers directly work with Protobuf messages for generating or parsing a stream of bytes in the network layer. The figure below illustrates this idea.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2020/11/22/Primitive-Data-Types-in-Neural-Search-System/blog-types-01.png"></p><p>I will explain the new <strong>primitive data types</strong> <code>Document</code>, <code>QueryLang</code>, <code>NdArray</code>; and the <strong>composite types</strong> <code>DocumentSet</code>, <code>QueryLangSet</code>, <code>Request</code>, and <code>Message</code> in this blog post. These data types are available since <code>v0.8</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/tree/master/jina/types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new <code>jina.types</code> module</a>. Primitive data types complete Jinaâ€™s design by clarifying the low-level data representation in Jina, yielding a much simpler, safer, and faster interface on the high-level. Most importantly, they ensure the universality and extensibility for Jina in the long-term.</p><div><p><strong>Jina</strong> is an easier way for enterprises and developers to build cross- &amp; multi-modal neural search systems on the cloud. You can use Jina to bootstrap a text/image/video/audio search system in minutes. Give it a try:</p><p><a href="https://get.jina.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jina-ai/jina?label=Star%20Jina%20on%20Github&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;color=3aa373" alt="GitHub Repo stars"></a></p></div><h4><span id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</span></h4><ul><li><a href="#new-data-types">New Data Types</a><ul><li><a href="#primitive-types">Primitive Types</a></li><li><a href="#composite-types">Composite Types</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#jina-data-types-in-action">Jina Data Types In Action</a><ul><li><a href="#setting-content">Setting Content</a></li><li><a href="#converting-content-types">Converting Content Types</a></li><li><a href="#construct-from-existing-document">Construct From Existing Document</a></li><li><a href="#unique-identifier-of-document">Unique Identifier of Document</a></li><li><a href="#access-nested-document">Access Nested Document</a></li><li><a href="#construct-query-language">Construct Query Language</a></li><li><a href="#construct-request">Construct Request</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#design-decisions">Design Decisions</a></li></ul><h2><span id="new-data-types">New Data Types</span></h2><p>In <code>v0.8</code>, we introduced three primitive data types, four composite types, and some derived helper types.</p><h4><span id="primitive-types">Primitive Types</span></h4><ul><li><strong><code>Document</code></strong> is a basic data type for representing a real-world document. It can contain text, image, array, embedding, URI, and accompanied by rich meta information. It can be recurred both <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/28/What-s-New-in-Jina-v0-5/" title="vertically and horizontally">vertically and horizontally</a> to have nested documents and matched documents. <code>Document</code> is the main object <code>Client</code> and <code>Driver</code> work with. User creates it when preparing the input; and its lifetime spans over the entire indexing and searching processes in Jina.</li><li><strong><code>QueryLang</code></strong> is a basic data type for representing the <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/28/What-s-New-in-Jina-v0-5/" title="query language structure">query language structure</a>. <code>Client</code> can use <code>QueryLang</code> to build filter/sort/select queries and convert <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/tree/master/jina/drivers/querylang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from/to <code>QLDriver</code></a>.</li><li><strong><code>NdArray</code></strong> is a basic data type for representing fixed-size multidimensional items of the same type. As the fundamental numeric type in Jina, <code>NdArray</code> is often used to represent <code>embedding</code>, <code>blob</code>, images, audios, texts; and joins the computation of other frameworks such as <code>numpy</code>, <code>tensorflow</code>, <code>pytorch</code>.<ul><li><strong><code>DenseNdArray</code></strong> is a specific data type for the dense representation of a <code>NdArray</code>. Same as <code>numpy.ndarray</code>, it contains values of all elements, the shape and the data type of each element. One can consider it as a <code>numpy.ndarray</code> <em>â€œviewâ€�</em> of the Protobuf data. <code>DenseNdArray</code> also provides a quantization interface to allow lossy compression.</li><li><strong><code>SparseNdArray</code></strong> is a specific data type for sparse representation of a <code>NdArray</code>, where substantial memory requirement reductions can be realized by storing only the non-zero entries. Jina <code>v0.8</code> provides the <code>scipy</code>, <code>tensorflow</code>, <code>pytorch</code> â€œviewsâ€� of the Protobuf data, which can directly join the corresponding frameworkâ€™s computation.</li></ul></li></ul><h4><span id="composite-types">Composite Types</span></h4><p>Besides primitive data types, three new composite types provide boxing on primitive types. This enables a more Pythonic interface and keeps the data safe from outside interference and misuse.</p><ul><li><strong><code>DocumentSet</code></strong> is a mutable sequence of <code>Document</code>. It allows one to slice/modify/add/delete the sequence and iterate over its element via a generator.</li><li><strong><code>QueryLangSet</code></strong> is a mutable sequence of <code>QueryLang</code>. Like <code>DocumentSet</code>, it allows one to slice/modify/add/delete the sequence and iterate over its element via a generator.</li><li><strong><code>Request</code></strong> is a data type for representing the message passing between Pods, <code>Client</code> and <code>Gateway</code>. It contains all data all Pods require, including <code>DocumentSet</code>, <code>QueryLangSet</code> and meta information. <code>Request</code> also provides a lazy interface to the underlying Protobuf data, avoiding unnecessary (de)serialization and (de)compression. The lifetime of <code>Request</code> spans over the entire indexing and searching processes in Jina: it is the first object users send to Jina and the final object retrieved from Jina.</li><li><strong><code>Message</code></strong> is a container of a Protobuf <code>Envelope</code> and the primitive type <code>Request</code>. It is the actual data type passing internally between Jina Pods.</li></ul><p>The next figure illustrates the connections between those data types:</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2020/11/22/Primitive-Data-Types-in-Neural-Search-System/blog-type-03.png"></p><h2><span id="jina-data-types-in-action">Jina Data Types In Action</span></h2><p>Now letâ€™s look at some examples.

<p>Many sports fans have a saying, often expressed on a wall of their neighborhood building: “you will never walk alone”. It shows the mass support of the entire ecosystem designed to help the team. The same goes for InsurTech—the future of the industry lies in platforms and ecosystems. Everything in favour of interconnected services, giving the user the ultimate experience.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-users-want-from-insurtech-innovations">What users want from InsurTech innovations…</h2>



<p>Customer behaviour patterns, needs and benefits-driven decisions shape whole companies, their products and efforts, towards <b>technological innovation as an ongoing process</b>. High tech like artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and machine learning are used on a daily basis. Alongside the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, technology trends ignite the minds of executives inside the insurance industry. Thanks to their efforts, companies can adjust business models and tailor the experience for paying customers.</p>



<p>The shift towards a <b>customer-centric approach</b> stems from the fact that customers don’t want the communication to be about the product. They want it to be about them. According to <a href="https://worldinsurancereport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/World-Insurance-Report-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Capgemini’s World Insurance 2020 report</a>, customers trust online research, social media testimonials and friends over agent/broker advice, and want to make independent decisions.</p>



<p>At the same time, the gap between the Millennials and older generations is virtually gone. Both groups do online or mobile transactions on a similar level (around 63%). Their risk assessment is surprisingly similar. While people go through life cycles and obtain high-value properties, get married or find new jobs, their priorities are gradually changing. Customers want to feel covered and secure, and experts say the same is true for both age groups. The difference is, the new generation expects an even higher standard of care. That’s where InsurTech innovations come in.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-how-these-innovations-look-like">…and how these innovations look like</h2>



<p>The InsurTech ecosystem is more than a network of partnerships. As <a href="https://insuranceblog.accenture.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-insurance-ecosystems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained in detail by Accenture</a>, “in an ecosystem, stakeholders are connected not only with the aim of obtaining a commercial advantage but also of disrupting the market by leveraging innovative experiences that are possible as a result of a partnership”. In plain English: many companies are upping their game. 51% of executives say they already experience market disturbance from companies partnered up with organisations from other industries.</p>



<p>What can traditional insurers bring to the table while undergoing <a href="https://codeandpepper.com/services/digital-transformation-it-services/">digital transformation</a> and developing modern financial services? They have at their disposal <b>decades of industry experience and institutional knowledge of complex regulations</b>. However, what insurers still lack, according to Accenture, are company culture, technology, and resources. To create or improve them all, insurance companies have to ask themselves two questions:</p>



<ul><li>How to give the customer a better experience?</li><li>How to enhance the already existing business model?</li></ul>



<p>The answer lies in Asia, where companies have managed to combine the three values typical for modern insurance solutions:</p>



<ul><li><b>Friction-reducing gateways</b> for customers switching between related services. Just like Facebook’s Messenger allows for shopping or checking into a hotel, new insurance products present similar opportunities. They will give you complementary services and help you manage insurance financing.</li><li><b>Integrating data from different services</b>. Having data is having a market advantage. The <a href="https://codeandpepper.com/2020/06/02/kyc-digital-identity-verification-leaders">know your customer (KYC) approach</a> gives InsurTechs the necessary insights to better address customer needs and market their offer.</li><li><b>Building a network of companies and apps</b> offering products, assistance, and combined value in a cross-selling model. This strategy is similar to the social mechanism used in recommendation engines (e.g. “a customer who bought product X was also interested in product Y”).</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-the-future-of-insurtech-is-here">The future of InsurTech is here</h2>



<p>The reason InsurTech thrives in Asia is that insurance processes serve everyday, real-life needs. <a href="https://pasarpolis.io/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PasarPolis</a> from Indonesia sells micro policies from $2. And yes, that’s the total cost. The company promotes the “instant claim” service as a fully automated feature. If your flight is delayed—you get paid, no formalities or questions asked. <a href="https://gigacover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gigacover</a> from Singapore offers insurance in bulk, maintaining low rates on a month-to-month basis. One of their most popular products is freelance income protection (FLIP), which costs under 40 US cents per day. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thecarevoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CareVoice</a> uses mobile-based and data-driven SaaS solutions to deliver a more user-friendly and less complicated experience.</p>



<p>That’s the level of disruption the industry must face right now. <b>It’s not one model, it’s flexibility and focus on local needs.</b> Some say eliminating agents (middlemen in the sales process) is the way to go, but Asian markets prove that people still want to do business with people. Customers in this part of the world don’t like to browse through possibly outdated user manuals. The Indian <a href="https://www.mintpro.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MintPro</a> by Turtlemint uses agents who can quickly explain policy details by phone. The sale itself is completed via mobile. The Indonesian <a href="https://www.fuse.co.id/home/AGENT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fuse Pro</a> goes even further and hires smartphone users as part-time sellers of the company insurance products.</p>



<h3 id="h-by-the-people-for-the-people">By the people, for the people</h3>



<p>Many Asian ideas for apps and business models come from <b>addressing very basic needs</b>. In many parts of the continent, the public health service is much to be desired. <a href="https://shuidihuzhu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Waterdrop</a>, which goes by Shuidihuzhu in China (translated as “water drop mutual help”), uses a mix of models. One of them encourages customers to make periodic contributions to the mutual aid pool. It’s insurance going back to basics: when merchants co-founded themselves in case any of them ran out of profit. It’s similar, simply adjusted for modern needs—people are helping themselves using technology, instead of market gatherings.</p>



<p>Another interesting company is <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PolicyBazaar</a>, an Indian app operating as an all-you-need offer aggregator. The platform lets you browse for everything: from car insurance, through retirement plans, to Covid-19 coverage. Instant claims and live assistants complete the picture of a customer-first policy.</p>



<h3 id="h-big-data-and-telematics">Big Data and telematics</h3>



<p>Driving behaviour is one of the biggest risks and variables for underwriters. That’s why insurance technologies make sure this risk can be mitigated. The <b>adoption of telematics</b> has unlocked new business models:</p>



<ul><li>usage-based insurance (UBI)</li><li>pay-as-you-drive (PAYD)</li><li>pay-how-you-drive (PHYD)</li></ul>



<p>There’s already a good use case. A British company O2 has launched a <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk/business/iot/solutions/smartvehicle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">car insurance product</a> that rewards users for safe driving. In a nutshell—the safer the drive, the lower the insurance cost.</p>



<p>There’s also an interesting case of using peer-to-peer (P2P) business model. The German <a href="https://www.friendsurance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Friendsurance</a> connects a group of people (from 10 to 16) via their mobile app. Focused on small property risks, like a broken car window, the startup offers users a pre-agreed cashback from the collective fund. This InsurTech innovation wouldn’t be possible without knowing how people live their lives and how to help them.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-is-a-group-walk">This is a group walk</h2>



<p>We are observing a strong trend of going back to basics. Insurance innovations come from cutting the “red tape” and including customers in the decision-making process. One click for a claim, one click away from every other functionality. Sports events are powerful because they generate emotions. Insurance is a touchy subject because it deals with emotions. Walking side by side with your customers allows you to create or improve the application. <a href="https://codeandpepper.com/services/insurance-insurtech-software-development">InsurTech software development</a> isn’t easy so let’s walk together on this journey.</p>

                  <p><img src="https://www.unibo.it/en/images/in-evidenza-piccole/universe/@@images/74a68e4e-af13-4c68-874d-1244b70e7fd2.jpeg" alt="Universe" title="Universe" height="152" width="200"></p><p>In their paper published in <i>Frontiers of Physics</i>, Franco Vazza (astrophysicist at the University of Bologna) and Alberto Feletti (neurosurgeon at the University of Verona) investigated the similarities between two of the most challenging and complex systems in nature: the cosmic network of galaxies and the network of neuronal cells in the human brain.</p>

<p>Despite the substantial difference in scale between the two networks (more than 27 orders of magnitude), their quantitative analysis, which sits at the crossroads of cosmology and neurosurgery, suggests that diverse physical processes can build structures characterized by similar levels of complexity and self-organization.</p>

<p>The human brain functions thanks to its wide neuronal network that is deemed to contain approximately 69 billion neurons. On the other hand, the observable universe can count upon a <i>cosmic web</i> of at least 100 billion galaxies. Within both systems, only 30% of their masses are composed of galaxies and neurons. Within both systems, galaxies and neurons arrange themselves in long filaments or nodes between the filaments. Finally, within both system, 70% of the distribution of mass or energy is composed of components playing an apparently passive role: water in the brain and dark energy in the observable Universe.</p>

<p>Starting from the shared features of the two systems, researchers compared a simulation of the network of galaxies to sections of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. The goal was to observe how matter fluctuations scatter over such diverse scales.</p>

<p>"We calculated the spectral density of both systems. This is a technique often employed in cosmology for studying the spatial distribution of galaxies", explains Franco Vazza. "Our analysis showed that the distribution of the fluctuation within the cerebellum neuronal network on a scale from 1 micrometre to 0.1 millimetres follows the same progression of the distribution of matter in the <i>cosmic web</i> but, of course, on a larger scale that goes from 5 million to 500 million light-years".</p>

<p>The two researchers also calculated some parameters characterising both the neuronal network and the cosmic web: the average number of connections in each node and the tendency of clustering several connections in relevant central nodes within the network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Once again, structural parameters have identified unexpected agreement levels. Probably, the connectivity within the two networks evolves following similar physical principles, despite the striking and obvious difference between the physical powers regulating galaxies and neurons", adds Alberto Feletti. "These two complex networks show more similarities than those shared between the cosmic web and a galaxy or a neuronal network and the inside of a neuronal body".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The encouraging results of this pilot study are prompting the researchers to think that new and effective analysis techniques in both fields, cosmology and neurosurgery, will allow for a better understanding of the routed dynamics underlying the temporal evolution of these two systems.</p>

<p>This study was published in <i>Frontiers of Physics</i> with the title "The quantitative comparison between the neuronal network and the cosmic web”. Its authors are Franco Vazza from the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Bologna, and Alberto Feletti from the Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement of the University of Verona.</p>

<p>Exactly-once is a desirable (if not critical) message delivery guarantee and a remarkably complex engineering challenge to solve. In this blog post, we will look at what exactly-once means in the context of distributed pub/sub systems, and the exactly-once guarantees that the <a href="https://www.ably.io/">Ably</a> realtime pub/sub messaging platform provides. Ably often acts as the broker in data streaming pipelines: publishers send messages to our platform, and we deliver these messages to subscribers. As a broker, Ably provides regional &amp; global fault tolerance, which ensures message availability and survivability. We also offer a set of capabilities via SDKs that enable clients to use idempotent publishing, and recover in the event of a failure while resuming precisely where they left off, with no lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/4-pillars-exactly-once-semantics-cover.png"></figure><h2 id="exactly-once-delivery-is-one-of-the-hardest-engineering-challenges">Exactly-once delivery is one of the hardest engineering challenges<br>
</h2>
<p>In the context of distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems, exactly-once is a popular concept and a desirable, if not critical, system property. It also leads to confusion and diverging opinions within the development community. On the one hand, some argue that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/">exactly-once is simply unachievable.</a> On the other hand, there are systems such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics">Kafka that claim to support exactly-once semantics</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that a lot of the confusion around the concept has to do with the fact that there's no clear definition of what exactly-once actually means. It's arguably impossible to come up with a definition to satisfy everyone and every use case. That's because exactly-once can mean different things for different systems and different use cases. Regardless of how you look at it, though, exactly-once is, without a doubt, a distinctively complex engineering challenge. </p>
<p>Let’s now define what exactly-once means for Ably in particular. In our case, exactly-once is a guarantee that once acknowledged, a message published to Ably is <strong>delivered</strong> to a consumer precisely once, even in the context of individual system components failing. Note that most often, Ably is used to deliver messages in real time directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to mention that exactly-once is a system-wide property, and you only achieve it if all the constituent components play their part. This doesn’t mean that all the components must display exactly-once characteristics. For example, in our case, you can have a publisher that displays at-least-once behaviour. However, Ably provides an idempotent interface, which cancels out the fact that the producer may occasionally publish messages more than once. As long as at the other end of the pub/sub pipeline each message is delivered to subscribers precisely once, exactly-once behaviour is achieved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-messaging-semantics">Types of messaging semantics<br>
</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into exactly-once delivery, let’s review the main types of messaging semantics. When a system is fully operational and working as intended, exactly-once delivery is the behaviour you generally expect. However, we must also consider how faults in the pub/sub system or, indeed, clients affect this behaviour. While most components fail independently in a distributed pub/sub system, without directly impacting other components, the overall quality of service can be affected. Depending on how the system behaves when failures do occur, you get several different types of messaging semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>At-most-once semantics</strong>. The easiest type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>At-least-once semantics. </strong>This is an improvement on at-most-once semantics. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern, or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exactly-once semantics</strong>. The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. It’s also the hardest to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/exactly-once-semantics-messaging-semantics-overview.gif" alt="Overview of message delivery semantics: at-most-once delivery, at-least-once delivery, exactly-once delivery."><figcaption>High-level overview of message delivery semantics</figcaption></figure><p>What most distributed pub/sub systems can genuinely guarantee is <strong>mostly-once </strong>delivery. This means that when the system is functioning as intended, messages are delivered exactly once. However, when failures are involved, there’s always a chance some messages will be delivered either at-most-once or at-least-once.</p>
<h3 id="failures-that-prevent-exactly-once-delivery">Failures that prevent exactly-once delivery<br>
</h3>
<p>To demonstrate just how hard it is for distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems to achieve exactly-once semantics, we must talk about failures—specifically, components that can fail and how these failures can be mitigated.<br></p>
<p><strong>Publisher failure</strong></p>
<p>When a publisher fails, some sort of recovery process takes place. Depending on its design, after recovery, the publisher may reattempt to publish a message that has already been sent to and acknowledged by the broker. In such an event, the publisher failure causes at-least-once behaviour. Another scenario is that the publisher’s recovery procedure fails to realise that the publish attempt failed, which leads to at-most-once behaviour. </p>
<p>A strategy often used after a publish failure is to retry publishing the same message a fixed number of times. This is a pragmatic approach, but unsatisfactory in the context of exactly-once. Imagine that the publisher recovers and unsuccessfully tries to republish the same message five times, and then gives up. Practically none of the three semantics is achieved. To mitigate publisher failures Ably supports <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/idempotency">idempotent publishing</a>, which ensures that regardless of how many times the same message is published to Ably, it will be delivered to subscribers exactly-once. <br></p>
<p><strong>Broker failure</strong></p>
<p>A broker failure has the potential to lead to all sorts of issues, including data loss. That’s why it’s recommended to design your system around the idea of mitigating or preventing loss of data. From a producer perspective, this could mean having the ability to publish messages at-least-once, so they can be resent to the broker if needed. </p>
<p>From a broker perspective (Ably included), let’s start by reviewing what a message ACK means. Obviously, it’s an acknowledgment that a published message has been received. Additionally, it should also imply that no subsequent failure will result in that message not being delivered to subscribers. In other words, it should be an acknowledgment that the broker provides sufficient redundancy to ensure continuity of service and onwards processing, even in the context of multiple infrastructure failures. Of course, nothing can be done to prevent or mitigate certain types of critical failures. When that happens, the sensible thing for the broker to do is to respond with a failure response (with HTTP, this is typically a 5xx status code), indicating clearly to the producer that the publish attempt was unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Subscriber failure</strong></p>
<p>The most common subscriber failure that prevents exactly-once delivery involves short disconnections. For example, a client app on a mobile device will disconnect and quickly reconnect when the user switches from a mobile data network to a Wi-Fi network or goes through a tunnel. To counter this scenario and ensure exactly-once behaviour, the stream of messages must resume precisely where it left off when the subscriber recovers. For this to be possible, the connection state must be persisted and resynced when the subscriber reconnects.</p>
<p>If the broker is the one keeping track of the last message sent, you are unlikely to provide exactly-once semantics. That’s because a broker might send a message, and the subscriber might successfully receive it and then disconnect before sending an ACK to the broker. In such a case, once the subscriber reconnects, the broker will resend the respective message (at-least-once semantics) since it has no way of knowing that the subscriber had received it before disconnecting.</p>
<p>To ensure exactly-once behaviour, the responsibility of keeping track of the last message received should sit with the subscriber - something we also do at Ably, via serial numbers. This way, when the subscriber reconnects, it notifies the broker of the last message it has received so that the stream can be accurately resumed from a point in time.</p>
<h3 id="exactly-once-semantics-use-cases">Exactly-once semantics use cases</h3>
<p>In the world of distributed pub/sub systems, exactly-once semantics has been and continues to be extremely hard to achieve. Equally, almost everywhere you look in software development, exactly-once is a highly desirable system-wide property, if not an essential one. For example, exactly-once is crucial for most transactional messaging use cases. At its core, a transactional message is triggered by a consumer action, and it usually includes necessary or high-priority info, e.g., a bank balance inquiry or an order confirmation. </p>
<p>Ordered operations represent another use case where exactly-once is fundamental. Let’s say you want to use <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/message-delta-compression/">delta compression</a> to only stream changes from the previous message to subscribers each time there’s an update. To achieve this, you need to use a transport that ensures data integrity through guaranteed message ordering and exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>If not crucial, exactly-once is at least highly desirable, because it improves overall system predictability and provides better experiences to users in general. For example, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Halbert W. Hall Speaker’s Series on Science Fiction and Fantasy,&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M University</p>

<p>~</p>
<p>Thank you so much to Texas A&amp;M for hosting me, and especially to the Science Fiction Archivist, Jeremy Brett, who invited me and orchestrated everything. He’s been a supporter of my work for years, and I’m so delighted to finally meet him, and to have the chance to address all of you. I’d also like to thank TAMU Libraries, the Glasscock Center for Humanities Research and its Science Fiction Studies Working Group, the Department of English, the Department of International Studies, and the Department of Visualization. I’m so honored by such an intersectional effort to bring me here. So thank you.</p>
<p>As Jeremy said, I write a lot of things, but when people ask me what I am, the first thing I say is that I’m a science fiction writer. I gave Jeremy a name for this talk before I wrote any of it, because I was still finishing my next novel. It’s called <em>The Actual Star. </em>It’s taken me six years to write. My agent is reading it as we speak. It jumps back and forth from the distant past, during the collapse of ancient Maya civilization; to the present, specifically the year 2012; to the far future, when a new global religion has brought lasting peace to humankind. So I spent a lot of the past year in the year 3012, in my head, imagining what the world will look like a thousand years from now. I want to talk to you about it because, like all science fiction, even though it’s set in the future, it’s a response to our present moment. My talk is called “Instructions for the Age of Emergency,” which is the time period we’re living in right now. In the far future, there are entire fields of study devoted to it, and to the people who lived in it, and what we must have been thinking.</p>
<p>During the last year, I locked myself out of social media for months at a time. I had to concentrate on work and, to be honest, protect my mental health after the election. I only read <em>The Washington Post</em> on my phone in bed in the morning—I still do—and that was enough. Everything I read, I asked myself, “How did we get here? What are the root causes? How can things be different?” And then I would try to answer those questions in the day’s writing.</p>
<p>The possibility I wanted to explore is that things didn’t start going astray after 9/11, or because of Nixon, or with the Industrial Revolution, or even with the invention of race that enabled the Native American genocide and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. I wanted to explore the possibility that humanity lost its way in the Neolithic Era. We regard the Neolithic as the beginning of history, and if we mean written history, maybe. But humans lived for two hundred thousand years before that—before the fall of Troy, before permanent settlements, before the invention of surplus and property and money and agriculture. All of that is only about twelve thousand years old, or, 6% of our history. The fact that we don’t have newspapers from the other 94% of our history doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. It also doesn’t make it any less important when thinking about the range of human possibility, and the range of possible human futures.</p>
<p>Much of science fiction deals with imagining dystopia. I’ll talk about why that is later, but I strongly believe that, at this moment in time, we need to remember that one of the highest callings of science fiction is imagining utopia. I don’t mean starry-eyed visions of a fairyland that drops out of the sky. I also don’t mean a static society built on some fundamental irony like panopticon or the suppression of free will. I mean honest, earnest engagement with the question of what a better world looks like.</p>
<p>In the <em>Earthseed </em>trilogy, Octavia Butler’s characters go through hell in their struggle to establish a utopian community. In the <em>Mars </em>trilogy, Kim Stanley Robinson’s characters go through several revolutions and constitutions in building a better world than the one they came from (Earth). Ursula K. Le Guin—who died while I was composing this talk—is the leader of us all in this regard. Her work engages the idea of realistic utopia over and over again—through Hain, Anarres, Gethen, Earthsea, and of course, Omelas.</p>
<p>My novel <em>The Actual Star </em>is an attempt to work in that same tradition. The distant past—the collapse of Maya civilization—takes place amid the failure of monarchy. The present—our age, the “Age of Emergency”—takes place amid the failure of capitalism. So, what does the year 3012 look like? I’ll first describe it, and then describe how I got there, extrapolating from this moment in time.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In 3012, the world operates by the twin philosophy of accumulation and dispersion. Put as simply as possible, The Law of Accumulation states that accumulation of any human property ultimately leads to human suffering. For example, accumulation of capital leads to inequality. Accumulation of family ties leads to feuds. Accumulation of feuds leads to war. Accumulation of population leads to disease. Accumulation of territory and power leads to war. Not necessarily at first, or even for centuries—but eventually, always.</p>
<p>The antidote is the Law of Dispersion. Put as simply as possible, it states that lasting peace can only result from the constant temporal and spatial dispersion of all human properties. In other words, we build a society that flows with, not against, the entropic nature of the universe.</p>
<p>In 3012, there are no borders. There are no nations. There are no families, aside from the human family. We call every other person “carnala,” a Mexican Spanish term meaning “a blood relation.” The average life expectancy is 130 years. The world population is steady at one billion. We roam the earth as permanent nomads, and, by common agreement, only own as much as we can carry—this is why the system is called Laviaja, a feminized form of “El Viaje,” Spanish for “the journey.” Those of us who cannot move or walk are accommodated so radically by mutual aid, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality that the very concept of disability no longer exists. In fact, many of us <em>choose </em>to have what we think of as disabilities, and call them “gifts,” because they are ways of creating community.</p>
<p>We eat primarily by foraging, a practice now aided by advanced artificial intelligence and augmented reality. No one eats animals, since we began learning their languages. Where there isn’t much to be foraged, our photosynthetic skin takes over. When we want home-cooked food, we go to a wayhouse. Wayhouses are places where we can rest for up to a period of nine days, in exchange for a few hours of work a day. We gather for two daily meals plus, in many areas of the world, teatime. Agribots—farming robots—do the majority of farming and gardening, strictly on a subsistence basis, near wayhouses. In other words, no one goes hungry. Food security is simply not an issue. This is because, at a certain point, around the 23<sup>rd</sup> century, all technology was built to serve humankind, not profit.</p>
<p>None of us stay in the same place for more than nine days. None of us even stay with the same people for more than nine days. But whomever we lose, we regain. With whomever we meet on the road, we fall into any number of familiar roles—sister and sister, lover and lover, mother and child, aunt and niece, elder and youth—and one of the greatest joys of life is that dance of discovery, of what each new person is to the other. If we give birth, we gladly give up our baby within nine days; assured that our child will come back to us again and again in the form of other children, throughout our lives.</p>
<p>There is no space travel, since space programs were dependent on capitalism. There are aliens, but they’re so far away that we have to wait a few hundred years every time we want to say anything, so it doesn’t affect our lives very much. There are no weapons; the very idea is strange. Crime is very rare; when it does happen, in the worst cases, the crime is made public and the perpetrator is marked for others to see and avoid if they wish, but the criminal is still allowed free movement in the world. Their exile is social.</p>
<p>There’s no currency or system of money; there’s a worldwide, perpetual gift exchange. Objects have no value beyond their practical use; a plastic bowl is as good as a porcelain bowl. There’s no manufacturing because there’s no need for material goods. Everything is used on a recycled basis.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifteen hundred genders. Anyone who wants to bear a child can do so. No pregnancy is unplanned. There’s no correlation between genitalia and gender. Some of the genders are in fact the descendants of nationalist and ethnic identities, as there have long ceased to be nations or ethnic groups in any meaningful way, given the Law of Dispersion. Identity is completely voluntary and mutable.</p>
<p>The system of government, such as it is, is a worldwide sortition democracy, which is actually a very old form of democracy. A legislature is randomly selected from a pool of all available citizens, from the age of seven years old. This legislature is in session twenty-four hours a day, its members refreshed every hour, on the hour, mostly just to re-ratify a basic Bill of Rights, but also to take up whatever special questions apply on the global scale. As a citizen, you’re called to serve for about one hour every year or two. For local matters, moving clusters of people are governed by algorithms called “umbrellas” that take into account each person’s needs and preferences. An umbrella may govern a single wayhouse, or an area of a hundred square kilometers, depending on the number of people present, which is always changing.</p>
<p>A person can opt out of this system. They aren’t punished. They aren’t banned. They’re never refused food or shelter, care or companionship, wherever they go. The highest law is the rule of the road, which is radical …</p></div></div>

So, founder of </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>, you guys are doing about $500,000 in revenue. I know you’ve got some more revenue on top of that, but you know, you sell professional services.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You only launched in 2017 and you’ve got over 2000 customers. So very great. so let’s start with actually who you are and why did you build a product and how did you grow it?</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. So my name is Craig Hewitt. I’m the founder of </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>. We’re a podcast hosting and analytics platform that also does a podcast editing and production. So that’s kind of our professional services arm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I got into </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>, kind of via the professional services. I owned and still do a product.service business called </span><a href="https://www.podcastmotor.com/plugin/"><span>PodcastMotor</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>That was kind of my first foray into online business and being a digital nomad, built that up into, you know, a really solid business that sustained kind of my family and I then had the opportunity to acquire a WordPress podcast plugin, which is really kind of how Castos started. So we also own and manage the </span><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/"><span>seriously simple podcasting</span></a><span> WordPress plugin that are our podcasts hosting platform interfaces with.</span></p><p><span>So a lot of people with a podcast have a website, a lot of them run on WordPress. We make it really easy for you to manage all of your podcast content, right from the WordPress site and then upload your files directly to the Castos platform.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>All right. So quite a plugin, I’m not going to ask you how much you paid for it, but do they have a lot of users?</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. I mean, WordPress gives you kind of fuzzy statistics, but it had more than 10,000 active installs and like everything and wordpress.org, it was entirely free and still is entirely free.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You can use a seriously simple podcasting plugin entirely for free. And then we have the </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos </span></a><span>platform as an optional add on. So it’s kind of our version of freemium.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Oh, great. That’s a great strategy. So you actually got something which had lots of very targeted customers, users and you only had to build customers behind it. So talk to me about </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>. How did you start building it?&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah, I’m laughing because you say you only had to build it.</span></p><p><span>I mean we did get lucky. I mean, it was lucky and strategic to say, yeah, Hey, we can acquire this plugin as a, you know, marketing and customer acquisition channels, was lucky and strategic but, I think building a really great product, especially in our market, which I think is both kind of B2C.</span></p><p><span>So like beat a pro-sumer maybe you would say but also is really, kind of sensitive in that, like it’s the way that people express themselves. So, you know, it’s like maybe a website hosting provider or something like that. You want the experience people to have there to be really easy and simple and beautiful.</span></p><p><span>And so I think building a tool like that is hard and our spaces, probably just as competitive as anyone else’s, but to build a really great product is super hard. Even if you have a marketing channel kind of already figured out, yeah, building a great product is super tough.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>So I actually said it because a lot of people I’ve spoken to, they really struggled with finding their target audience. So they go on LinkedIn on all sorts of different customer acquisition channels. Really sending out cold emails, trying to get them on the phone, talking to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I said it, from that perspective that you had the audience ready and you were able to talk to them probably very quickly, you didn’t have to go and try different things to get them on the call.</span></p><p><span>So of course, building a great product takes a long time. Even with the best customer feedback, you’ll probably end up doing something which is not needed in the marketplace.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I agree with you, it’s not easy. I’ll probably make it sound very easy, but it’s actually very difficult. Being a software entrepreneur myself. I know it’s very difficult.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah for sure. Yeah. I mean, we did have a lot of access to the folks that ended up becoming our first customers and I also came from the space, you know, so running a product as service in the podcasting space is how we got introduced to the guy that we bought the plugin from.</span></p><p><span>We had a bunch of customers that had a presence we’re able to leverage a lot of that audience. You know, we talked about the audience before we started recording.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I think a lot of that made the marketing and the distribution easier for us. At the beginning, we just focused on the product, which made it a lot easier.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Let’s talk about product development. What does that look like from day one, till the point where you probably launched your first beta version?&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Bad. I mean, I’m not a developer, right? I’m a non-technical founder and I’m a single founder. So, it was me figuring out how to work with a developer and pay them and build a nice product that people care about and have it be easy to use without any experience doing any of that.</span></p><p><span>And, I mean, I laugh looking back at our initial product. It was really terrible compared to what we have now, which I think is really great but that’s how it should be.</span></p><p><span>You know, they say like, if you’re not embarrassed of your first version, you launched too late. we didn’t launch too late in that respect. I mean, the way we did it is I think a nice model for folks if they’re starting out like as a consultant or they own an agency or something like that is use that revenue to pay rent and support your family and stuff like that, but also to fund the development of your software product.</span></p><p><span>And that’s what we did. So we were able to hire a developer part-time. And it took about five months to build a product and to update the WordPress plugin to kind of support that and then we launched, kind of that to existing audiences of WordPress users and very fortunately kind of had customers on the first day which I think is something that not a lot of people do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had a kind of major hiccup on the WordPress side with our launch day that kind of broke some people’s sites and stuff. But aside from that, the SAAS side of things, the product launch actually went pretty smoothly.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. So when you say launch, did you follow any email sequence? Did you create some hype or you just sent them an email and said, look, okay, we’ve launched this product.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. I think we might have sent an email a couple of days before launch and then sent an email on launch day but we put some things into the WordPress kind of user experience to prompt people and say, Hey, you know, here’s this hosting platform you can opt in here and have your files hosted and manage all of your stuff from WordPress.</span></p><p><span>So a lot of the opt-in of that conversion and like awareness for the customers was kind of natively in WordPress. You have to be careful about that. I think to respect the real estate there and respect the way people use that tool since it is, you know, open-source and free and people don’t want to be bugged there.</span></p><p><span>And I think we do and did a good job of respecting that. But at the same time, putting the value proposition in front of customers in an authentic and genuine way.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>How did the product go from there? So you got like a bunch of customers in the beginning. Straight away. And you got a bunch of users.</span></p><p><span>How did you work with them after that? And how did you get into a point where it’s a great product now?</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. I think that the easy answer is we just listened to everything everybody said and try to distill it down because I think that’s really hard if you’re hearing a bunch of different things and I’ve had failed attempts at other products where everybody is saying something different and you, at the end of the day, you just say like, what is going on here?</span></p><p><span>Like, how are we so far off that. This guy says they need an API. This guy says they need OAuth. This guy says they need a better UI and it’s all over the place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You can’t say, this is the thing we need to do. I think maybe we have the volume of feedback, from a bunch of free users of the plugin and very fortunately a decent number of paying users of the hosting platform to say, okay, a bunch of people are asking for this thing, let’s go tackle this.</span></p><p><span>And it was like whack-a-mole right. So like you go to the arcade and you get this game where like the little mole pops up and you whack him on the head and then he comes over here and you whack him on the head over there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And that’s, I mean, that’s what we did for an embarrassingly long amount of time, like a year and a half of just like, well, what’s the fire this week.</span></p><p><span>Let’s go put it out. Let’s go fix this thing or create this feature or whatever. But I think we’re pretty agile in that way. Even today, our product development cycles are not super long, but we stay really attuned to what our customers are asking for.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our support team gives us a lot of really actionable feedback that informs the product decisions and product cycle.</span></p><p><span>And, we’re not an old enough company. You know, we’re not base camp to say like, Hey, we’re going to …</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

	<h3>Facebook is facing a new wave of criticism for providing a platform for a white supremacist network with over 80,000 online followers.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Facebook only removed these pages after being contacted by large media organisation the <em>Observer</em>. The Center for Countering Digital Hate claim they were made aware of this two years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Guardian reports this Neo-Nazi network also has ties to the UK far right, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/22/facebook-condemned-for-hosting-neo-nazi-network-with-uk-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including a student facing terrorism charges</a>. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“Facebook’s leadership endangered public safety by letting Neo-Nazis finance their activities through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook was first told about this problem two years ago and failed to act.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the <em>Observer</em> contacted Facebook, they began taking down the material with a Facebook spokesperson stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have removed the content which violates our policies prohibiting dangerous organisations. We regularly work to improve our technology to find and remove this content faster, and, while there is more work to do, we are making progress. We’ve banned over 250 white supremacist organisations from Facebook and Instagram.”</p></blockquote>

Squarespace recently added a feature that enables me to see what queries lead people to my site by keywords.&nbsp; Given I write about dozens of topics related to Mexico, imagine my surprise to see the keywords leading people to my site were Zytiga, Embril, and Humira. The names of expensive drugs.</h2><p>I felt terrible that I had not delivered on those queries, as I had only posted the U.S. prices of drugs in the context of demonstrating the excesses of the American healthcare system.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that I know people are seeking this information out and running into my site, I’ve taken some time to research what the most expensive drugs in the U.S. cost in Mexico, starting with those most commonly used by people over 50 years old.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if you're not yet in the market for these drugs, I'm sure you'll find the list enlightening.</p><p>This information is not available to you in the U.S. without a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The reasons are probably no more nefarious than the Google algorithms behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>Google searches (and I would assume other search engines) are location-based. While that’s great when you are looking for a dry cleaner, it’s not so good when you are doing research for information like drug prices in another country.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1558556648706_18811"><div><p>The best way to access this information is by using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to hide your location from search engines.&nbsp; With a VPN you choose what server you want to use. When I had a VPN in Mexico last year, I chose a Denver server to prevent my searches from coming up local and in Spanish.</p><p>In this case, to access the information about drug prices in Mexico or another country, you would need to choose a server in the country of choice and do the query in that language. Being in Mexico already, I didn’t need a V.P.N. All I needed to do was ask, “Cuanto cuesta Zytiga en Mexico.”&nbsp; If I were in the States seeking the information, I'd choose a server in Mexico, and do my searches in Spanish just to be sure.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1533001011992_99855"><div><p>The prices you see in the list below are what the drugs cost from major drug wholesalers in Mexico. The packaging and trademark information is identical (other than being in Spanish).</p><p>If the price isn’t listed beside a drug name, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not available.

<p>I'm somewhat soft at work and avoid ruffling feathers, so this tweet struck a chord.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Heard this today from a coach, and resonated: stop chasing being liked by everyone, start chasing being respected by everyone.</p>— Akshay Kothari (@akothari) <a href="https://twitter.com/akothari/status/1329652910204981250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>Don't misunderstand me. Being liked feels good and being nice builds healthy and fun relationships. But I find that when I'm mainly driven by wanting to please or not offend people, I end up making suboptimal or unprincipled decisions that make me unhappy and unsuccessful in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>People have various reasons to like or dislike you. Many of these reasons are selfish, irrational, short-term and finicky. Putting your self-worth, purpose and actions at the whims and fancies of the black box of being liked is an unclear and volatile approach. The reasons to like or dislike are often at odds with other people's and even your welfare, principles and goals. So aiming to be liked doesn't lead to the best outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll go a step further from this tweet and say that <i>don't even aim to be respected</i>. Even though chasing respect may be in some ways better because respect can be slightly more rational, principled, long-term or outcome based, it has the same core problems as chasing being liked.&nbsp;</p><p><b>So what is the alternative? Chase your principles and goals.&nbsp;<span></span></b></p><p>The core idea behind Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Success People is to be "Principle centered" rather than centering around People, Self, Family, Money, Health etc.&nbsp;</p><p>That means you define (and periodically revise) your principles and goals. Then you aim to live with <i>integrity</i> - your thoughts, words, actions match your values, principles and goals. You can and may likely have to still be humble, empathetic, respectful and supportive of others while pursuing those, but you may not make all people happy and that's okay.&nbsp;</p><p>Being principle-centered will mean being opinionated, saying no and disagreeing with people, that may make people dislike you. There's a chance that some of them may respect you in long-run because they see that you are independent, principled and successful. But most importantly, you live with the happiness of working on what you control, chasing self-created and steady goals, and the satisfaction and certainty of being true to your core principles and living the life you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get upset and unhappy about many things.&nbsp;</p><p>Your manager or customer criticized your work. Your colleagues aren't being thoughtful or cooperating. You didn't get the promotion, award, or raise you wanted or think you deserved.&nbsp;</p><p>Your parents, wife, friends or kids are asking you to do things you don't want to or misunderstand you. They don't act in a way that you feel is right or helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>You are running low on savings and income, and worried that you can't support yourself and your family. You are in physical pain or your health is declining and you have unusual body aches and insomnias.&nbsp;</p><p>Your country or community is divided. The system seems broken, leaders are corrupt, people are selfish and ignorant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of these worries and unhappiness are rooted in these four root causes.&nbsp;</p><p>1. <b>Judgement instead of Acceptance</b>. You don't accept reality as it is. You lament it, you disagree with it, you think it's unfair or it sucks. You expect and wish it to be different or better.&nbsp;</p><p>Why did you have those expectations in the first place? Why did you think people, your environment, your mind and body are going to be just the way you want them to? Who told you that life is all rainbows and butterflies.</p><p>You can hope, plan and work towards an ideal reality in the future. But your current reality is what is is. Don't judge it, regret it, or deny it. Love it, embrace it, understand it, then play and work with it. <a href="http://www.aswathkrishnan.com/2020/08/life-is-improv-create-great-scenes.html" target="_blank">Life is an improv</a>&nbsp;show - you don't control the scenes, you accept and act in them.&nbsp;</p><p>2. <b>Attachment instead of Openness</b>. You want something or don't want to lose something you have. You decide to be unhappy until you get that and worried whenever they are uncertain or even slightly threatened.&nbsp;</p><p>You have no idea about why you were born, what life is about and you know you will eventually die and be absolutely forgotten. So what are these wants and where do these come from? Are they worth the constant unhappiness and anxiety?</p><p>We can't all live like monks with no wants or attachments. But pick your attachments consciously and limit it to a few meaningful one - don't just pick them up unconsciously.&nbsp; When you have a negative emotion, think about it, uncover the underlying attachment and eliminate it. Be flexible with your wants and <a href="http://www.aswathkrishnan.com/2019/10/peace-and-joy.html" target="_blank">go with the flow</a>. Everything is impermanent.&nbsp;<span></span></p><p><b>3. Negativity and Hate instead of Optimism and Love. </b>You assume things and people are worse than they are. You cave in to comparison, greed, envy or jealousy. You think, say and act on these negativities. They make you more upset and act more negatively, which makes the situation even worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Accept the nature of people and the world as they are. Everyone's Be a well wisher and give everyone a benefit of the doubt.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2213281878057251230/6895673630879853860" target="_blank">Don't assume malice, when it could be misunderstanding</a>, ignorance or incompetence. This doesn't mean that you have to be naive and be taken advantage of. Hold your principles, work with situation as they are, choose to be around people and situations that align with your values.&nbsp;</p><p><b>4. Nature instead of Practice. </b>You expect to be happy and balanced by default, without consistent effort. You get out of the rut once or twice, experience clarity, and expect that to last forever.&nbsp;</p><p>We are survival machines. Our biological programming, innate nature and societal influence will always bias us towards worry, insecurity, and wanting. Our equilibrium is to be unhappy.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like you don't expect to be muscular if you don't work out regularly, don't expect to be calm and happy if you don't work on your mind. Move your body often to move your mind. Take time to relax and to do things you enjoy. Share your situation and get help from a therapists, coaches or friends. Be intentional about your life philosophy, goals, people and environment. Practice regular meditation, gratitude, and reflection.&nbsp;</p><p>You got one life - cherish it and live it well!&nbsp;</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-the-linear-non-primitives | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-the-linear-non-primitives">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>On our first set of data structures, we get into the definition and scope of non-primitive structures. Have a look at the previous read on  <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/the-power-of-data-structures">The Power of Data structures</a> in case you feel a little lost. Right off the batt, we define what it means to be a non-primitive set, and how this can be further broken down.</p>
<p>Let's get right into it. A non-primitive structure is what happens when you combine two or more primitives. What we mean is simple. A <code>char</code> and  <code>int</code> , for instance,  are primitives. The simplest representations of data. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, linear non-primitives can be grouped further as below:</p>
<h2 id="linear-non-primitives">Linear non-primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>LInked lists</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, as stated before, data is sequential - one after another. Some of these structures might <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">ring a bell</a>, stackify, is that you?. </p>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>These are what we call stores of homogenous (meaning similar) data. So one might have an array like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>my_array</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>,<span>9</span>] 

<span>vowels</span> = [<span>' a'</span>, <span>'e'</span>, <span>'i'</span> , <span>'o'</span>, <span>'u'</span> ] 
</code></pre><p>Note how <code>my_array</code> has only integers while <em>vowels</em> has <em>char</em>. In both instances, our array has a collection of primitives - <strong>one type of primitive per array</strong>. </p>
<p>Arrays are of a fixed size. Once declared, the computer knows the amount of memory reserved for items to be stored there.  You might ask:</p>
<p><em>"But what if the type of data I have changes in size greater than the array?" </em></p>
<p>Well, you might need to consider a different type of structure to store this data. 
Use arrays, for instance, to store months of the year. We will not be changing this count anytime.</p>
<p>Above declared, the sizes of the arrays are inferred. Meaning the types, since not defined per se, are  'figured out' based on the values and how we use them.</p>
<p>We might as well have this:</p>
<p>For python.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> array

count_down = array.array(<span>'i'</span>, [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>])


</code></pre>
<p>Types may go on as:</p>
<p><code>c</code> for <em>char</em>
<code>f</code> for <em>float</em>
<code>d</code> for <em>double</em>
<code>u</code> for <em>unicode</em> and so forth.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html?highlight=arrays">documentation</a> for more insight into this. AS well, take note that the <code>array module</code> has different functions to enable array manipulation.</p>
<p>Rust:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> count_down: [<span>i32</span>; <span>5</span>] = [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>];


</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Important pointer:
    Python lists and arrays are not the same!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Operations on an array will be based on the <code>index</code> of the array element, with indexing starting from <em>0</em>. Hence, the first item, in either case, would be:</p>
<pre><code><span>count_down</span><span>[0]</span>
</code></pre><p>The result from the above is 5 (the semi-colon has been left out for brevity but should be used based on the language you are using).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at another structure that looks similar, but is not the same - <strong>Linked lists</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="linked-lists">Linked lists</h3>
<p>Unlike arrays, linked lists store data in a non-contiguous form. This implies one piece of data is not placed side by side to the other as: <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>, rather it is stored in form of nodes with pointers to the next as so:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>[data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[data1, pointer_to_data3]</span> ... <span>and</span> <span>so</span> <span>on</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605257211148/M0hJg9a9v.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="linked_list.png"></p>
<p>The last item in our linked list, since there is no pointer to the next, would have <code>null</code>. </p>
<p>As well, linked lists are dynamic-  their size is not fixed at initialization. </p>
<p>Linked lists will be further broken to:</p>
<p>a) Singular linked lists (used in the elaboration of linked lists above)</p>
<p>b) Circular linked lists</p>
<p>c) Doubly linked lists</p>
<h4 id="circular-linked-lists">Circular linked lists</h4>
<p>These have three items in a node: the previous data, the data, and finally, the next data in the sequence.</p>
<pre><code><span>[null, data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[pointer_to_data_1 ,data1, pointer_to_data3]</span>
</code></pre><p>The first item (the head), has a <code>null</code> as the previous pointer while the last node has <code>null</code> on the next pointer.</p>
<h4 id="doubly-linked-lists">Doubly linked lists</h4>
<p>Similar to circular linked lists, these have two pointers as well. The only difference would be the last node, instead of a <code>null</code>, has a pointer back to the first item in the list. 1 + 1 = circular.</p>
<p>In most of what we implement through code, we have implementations of linked lists. You will hardly get yourself doing this manually, but understanding that some of the things we call 'mutable arrays ' are actually implementations or wrappers around more complex structures.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
If navigating through my directory, my computer needs to know where I am, where I'm from, and possibly have the correct link/structure to the nested directory I'm navigating to. So to the top-level directory, I cannot go any higher, no previous node. Likewise to the last directory or file, there is no 'next' option.</p>
<p>Till now, we have come to understand the importance of data structures, the groups they have been placed into, and we have an idea of what some of the linear data structures involved. We could go on and on on the details of each, but that is a tale for another day. A breather for us both at this point.  Go read something non-algorithm-like for a moment. We'll still meet here, same time,  same drive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Inline abstractions and simplify logic to write better code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programmer’s work today is based on different levels of abstractions in the form of APIs and modules, they hide large amounts of implementation details so we can build features and products without understanding every detail. However, abstractions also increase the complexity of our code. Lots of time I struggle with overly complex code and try to fix those pieces by removing unnecessary abstractions. But how can we tell the abstraction is good or bad? How much abstraction in the code is too much? This article will be focusing on some of my views about abstraction and complexity in programming.</p>
<h2 id="Power-of-abstraction"><a href="#Power-of-abstraction" title="Power of abstraction"></a>Power of abstraction</h2><p>Abstraction is the building block of programmer today, it free programmer from massive details of complexity, without it we will still be writing machine code, for examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>Python and Ruby is an abstraction layer running on C interpreter</li>
<li>C is a layer on instruction set.</li>
<li>Rails provide multiple abstraction layers like MVC (model-view-controller), ORM (ActiveRecord, object-relation mapping)</li>
<li>React hide DOM updates into declarative components and state.</li>
</ul>
<p>In those examples, the abstractions provide a huge benefit by encapsulating details and provide a high level syntax or API to let people understand and use it.</p>
<h2 id="Essential-and-accidental-complexity"><a href="#Essential-and-accidental-complexity" title="Essential and accidental complexity"></a>Essential and accidental complexity</h2><p>Although abstraction is a really powerful tool, it also has its limitation.</p>
<p>In the paper “<a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Silver Bullet</a>“, it defines the software complexity into 2 parts. Essential complexity and accidental complexity.</p>
<p>Essential complexity is the complexity inherent from the problem domain. Including the mutation of state, condition, the order of procedure, and messaging. All other complexities from the language, framework, or stack are accidental. The line between those 2 complexities might vary, but basically, you can solve the problem with different languages, different software, but the essential - the algorithm and logic to solve the problem - can not be reduced. For example, you can write the quicksort in C, python, Haskell, or even pseudo-code. The essential complexity of quicksort still stays the same. Therefore no matter how much the technology of tooling improves, there is still no silver bullet to solve the essential complexity issue to increase the productivity of programmers.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-of-abstraction"><a href="#Problem-of-abstraction" title="Problem of abstraction"></a>Problem of abstraction</h2><p>Abstraction is a useful tool to reduce accidental complexity, but it also has several drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can not reduce essential complexity. </li>
</ol>
<p>Although abstraction can largely reduce accidental complexity, make the code closer to the problem domain by providing higher-level syntax and API. However, the problem domain still inherits the complexity from the real world. Abstraction can not make it simpler. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It increases accidental complexity.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a tricky part because abstraction is not essential for solving the problem. Any extra abstractions are increasing accidental complexity. But then how the abstraction decrease complexity? By enough usage of it. A higher-level abstraction can represent multiple lower-level concept together. So with more usage, it can encapsulate more details and make the code focus on essential complexity but not accidental. So with the growth of the problem domain, the complexity with abstraction will grow like this: <img src="http://neethack.com/2020/10/Abstraction-and-essential-complexity/pic1.png" alt="pic1">. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the graph, it will increase more complexity. For example, we can create the acronym “ECAC” to represent those 2 types of complexity. If I only use this acronym once in this post, it only makes this more complicated because the acronym is not essential. However, if this article got widely accepted, we might be able to call our colleague “you should look at the ECAC for your code” Then it make the conversation simpler.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It might be wrong or misleading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Abstractions are not essential, so in the worst case, it might not be correct and misleading. This graph shows how complexity grows with wrong abstractions. <img src="http://neethack.com/2020/10/Abstraction-and-essential-complexity/pic2.png" alt="pic2"></p>
<p>If an abstraction does not have enough usage to cover the extra complexity introduced. It only makes to code more complicated. Or the abstraction might not be able to successfully hide lower-level details, and users even have to bypass the abstraction. Both of those cases make the abstraction increasing accidental complexity rather than decrease it.</p>
<h2 id="Reduce-complexity"><a href="#Reduce-complexity" title="Reduce complexity"></a>Reduce complexity</h2><p>Then how can we properly reduce the complexity of our code? Here’s are a couple of suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make reducing essential complexity the priority</li>
</ol>
<p>Because unlike abstractions, a better algorithm is basically, better.</p>
<p>The way I use to estimate is by inline most of the abstractions in our problem domain to see procedures, conditions, messaging, and state mutations. And try to make those steps simpler, like removing redundant steps, changing the order to remove conditions, and remove unnecessary states. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Always evaluate multiple solutions</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes it is really hard to evaluate the changes are worth it or not, Therefore evaluate multiple solutions is a good guideline. We can find what is essential in different solutions, And follow Occam’s Razor principle: the simplest solution usually is the best solution.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Reorganize, inline, and rename code</li>
</ol>
<p>With those methods we can reduce extra abstractions and reduce accidental complexity, Also help you understand the logic and find a better algorithm.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Rule of three</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic rule to introduce abstraction is to wait until you have 3 usages. It might vary but that is the least case for the abstraction to be useful.</p>
<h2 id="Example"><a href="#Example" title="Example"></a>Example</h2><p>Here I am going to reuse the example in Sandi Matz’s talk: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXi_FBrZQiU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polly want a message</a>, In this talk, Sandi explains how object-oriented and abstraction can simplify a project that read a file and print line numbers, here is the source:</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-83d26a75802dd2ca90d0"><div><p><span><strong><em>Chapter One: The Past </em></strong></span></p><p>Disney is the envy of every media company, regardless of whether it focuses on film, TV, gaming, music or publishing. In plain terms, there has never been a more dominant entertainment company, globally or in the US. It has a brand that actually matters to consumers, owns franchises that consumers essentially treat like subscription content services, and operates the biggest star-making platforms in the world. And as strong as this platform was at the start of 2019, it exited the year even stronger. In a matter of weeks, Disney’s brand new direct-to-consumer platform acquired 30MM subscribers.</p><p>The deeper we get into the digital era, the more dominant Disney seems to become. After all, it was long expected that the Internet would disrupt dominant media companies and IP via rights infringement and the emergence of myriad user-generated “franchises”. However, one of the biggest storytelling “lessons” in the 20th and early 21th century was that audiences have an unending desire for “more” of the stories they <em>already </em>love. And the Internet has enabled this to an unprecedented degree. You can constantly track production (cast Instagrams, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and leaks on social media), engage in fan communities (message boards and YouTube theory/Easter egg videos), consume endless amounts of fan content (e.g. fanfic and watch-along podcasts), play this content back on demand (e.g. Netflix), and engage in never-ending and constantly updated online multiplayer games (e.g. Star Wars: Battlefront 2). This is a powerful, self-sustaining financial and cultural flywheel. And Disney has many of the franchises that best lend themselves to this model. Many of those they don’t own, such as <em>Harry Potter</em>, have their rights fragmented.</p><p>But what is the strongest, most profitable, most defensible part of Disney’s business in the digital era? Its capex-heavy, physical theme parks.</p><p>There is no simple way to quantify how important this business unit is to Disney. The financial role is obvious. Disney’s Parks &amp; Attractions segment generates nearly 100% more revenue and 60% more profit than Disney’s studio division (which already generates nearly three times the revenue AND three times the gross <em>margins </em>as its primary competitors). By turning hit films into theme park attractions, not only does Disney generate more “upside” from a hit than its competitors do, Disney’s breakeven point for these films is also much lower. But the parks are much more than this direct financial benefit. There is nothing that can compare to the impact of a child being hugged by her heroes. The ability to enjoy your favorite IP as “you” is unique and lasts a lifetime. Consider, for example, how many families have Disneyland photos of their kids with Mickey or Woody on the fridge. Or how many of these kids have kept those photos decades later (and compared them to their eventual spouse’s version of that same photo).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_17902"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_24796"><div><p>And because of real estate scarcity, lengthy build times, enormous capital requirements (exacerbated by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol's_cost_disease"> Baumol’s Cost Disease</a>), Disney’s theme parks, resorts, and cruises are incredibly difficult to replicate by another Western media company. It would take twenty years and tens of billions of dollars for AT&amp;T/WarnerMedia to receive permits, design attractions, and build a fully operational theme park, for example (and it’d probably be in the middle of nowhere). It’s especially hard to imagine all of this occurring while the company is investing tens of billions per year into HBO Max, new 5G network infrastructure, and maintenance capex (while also sustaining tens of billions in dividends and debt service, and fending off agitated investors). Comcast/Universal has an ambitious plan to grow its parks footprint, including new resorts in Russia, South Korea, and Singapore. However, these will take years and tens of billions of dollars. Purely comping the number of parks also overlooks the scale differential. Disney’s Orlando resort, for example, is over 25,000 acres (half used). Universal Studios Orlando is barely 500. In addition, Disney operates four cruise ships (another three are due by 2023), while no competitor does. Overall, Disney’s theme parks business generates more than $26B per year with 175MM+ visitors, compared to 6B for Universal Studios, with 50MM.</p><p>However, the defensibility and value of these businesses goes beyond physical and financial barriers to entry; running a successful theme park means far more than designing a fun ride. Giving real hugs to kids is incredibly dangerous — doing this reliably, safely, and positively millions of times per year requires enormous training (the parks also operate hospitals, pet day care and police services, too!). In addition, these parks must cater to a wide variety of different customers with different needs, physical capabilities, and developmental maturity. In contrast, a film or TV show has only one version that lasts forever and is infinitely repeatable with 100% consistency. There is no other “medium” in the entertainment industry that requires melding more art forms (e.g. live performance, set design, music, engineering) with a smaller margin for error, and at such a great scale. The benefit, though, is a rich, hard to replicate and intimate understanding of the consumer.</p><p>The competitive consequences are profound and only growing. Fans simply cannot enjoy DC or Lord of the Rings or Dragon Ball the way they do Disney’s Princesses, Pixar, most recently, Star Wars, and soon, the Avengers franchises. This fundamentally limits a franchise’s ability to grow love — the lifeblood (and profit driver) of all IP-based companies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_105588"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_134473"><div><p>This is why brands like 20th Century Fox and WarnerMedia license their theme park IP from super-popular brands like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and <em>Harry Potter</em> to their competitors, Disney and Universal. Nintendo also partnered with Universal for its theme park rights. This extension is strategically important and financially valuable, but it’s also quite costly. The rights owner, for example, neither owns the customer relationship nor do they deliver the end-customer experience (in a weird way, Universal has a closer relationship with <em>Harry Potter</em> fans than WarnerMedia does). In addition, the majority of associated profits go to the park operator — who also gets to intermingle their IP and draft off the popularity of their competitors’ franchises, too. That’s risky in an age where franchises and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/disneylessons">clarity of franchise ownership is key</a>.</p><p>So, as we embrace the digital era, it’s funny to consider the enduring and durable significance of the analogue theme parks business. It is incredibly profitable and will continue to grow as new mobile technology/personalization enhance the park-going experience. The barriers to replication are incredibly high and span both fixed investment (land and infrastructure) and skillset (e.g. design and boots-on-the-ground operations). It also offers an intimate understanding of the consumer, is particularly potent when connected to an IP flywheel, and is able to constantly renew its appeal through new attractions and updates.</p><p><span><strong><em>Chapter Two: The (Start of the) New Theme Parks</em></strong></span></p><p>These parks exist and thrive because of our desire to be “inside a living story”. This was Walt’s primary goal with Disneyland: to go beyond passive consumption and into active immersion. Consider the following quote from one of Disney’s chief Imagineers: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Disneyland is an experience involving many moving parts in harmony, like an orchestra. Everything has to be tuned, what you hear, what you smell, what you see, how you see it, the speed at which you assimilate all of that, just like a film, is choreographed. But how do you choreograph that if you don't control the camera, because the camera is you — it's you when you come to Disneyland".</em></p></blockquote><p>This idea of agency is key. There’s only so much time one can spend in a physical or virtual world as a pre-defined character. That doesn’t mean we want to remain an exact replica of our “IRL” selves — we might want to be taller, or blue, or metal, and so on. But when you’re <em>specifically </em>Iron Man, there are limits to what you can look like, how you can behave, what you can do or be, where you can go, and how long it makes sense to be there. After all, you can’t actually be Iron Man, just pretend to be. And certainly, it doesn’t make sense if all of your friends are all Iron Man, too.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/DonaldMustard&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;>In Fortnite you will always be you.

	<div>
		<p>This is a piece about the loss of skills — even ones that are marks of great beauty and mastery — due to a change in environment.</p>
<p>It’s an extreme example but a fun one to think through: who would play a Stradivarius violin in interstellar space?</p>
<p>As a way to think through an extreme environmental (not meaning climate here) change, I make the assumption that in coming centuries, whether one, five, or 10, humans will become an interstellar or extrasolar species. That is, some part of humanity will cease living in this solar system, and will instead live on other planets, space ships, or other artificial homes. <strong>I count that assumption as the less interesting part of this post and instead focus on the unintended consequences caused by a dramatic change in environment.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s think through what happens to a specific type of human mastery (and by extension, a framework to apply to many others) as humans make extreme choices (like leaving earth).</p>
<p><em>Q: Who will play the Stradivarius in interstellar space or on extrasolar planets? A: No one. Longer answer below.</em> <span id="more-947"></span></p>
<p>Today, on earth, many people achieve mastery in some skill.</p>
<p>We can include “common” skills such as learning your native language to fluency and skills that are innate, like learning to walk. The rarer skills I consider here require more concerted effort to acquire.</p>
<p>Types of skills in demand are plentiful but change over time. Some skills used to be mainstream but are now niche or largely lost except in small isolated groups, such as navigation by stars, foraging, or making clothing from scratch. Bringing those skills back to an <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorant</a> larger population would not make sense today. Some skills are preserved by small niches of people within families or initiates (such as Chinese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfGdJIzYZs">“face changing” or bian lian</a>). Some are preserved widely by those who opt in by putting in the work, such as chess, forms of painting and ceramics, and musical performance.</p>
<p><strong>For some of the skills with modern masters, leaving earth will mean that future humans will neither preserve those skills, nor be able to acquire them even if they wanted to.</strong></p>
<p>I chose music because it is an enduring human behavior, unlikely to disappear. I chose Stradivarius violins because they represent mastery in physical instrument construction and rarity.</p>
<p>With only 650 instruments remaining (around 500 violins) and <a href="http://www.stradivarius.org/price/">often sold</a> for prices in the millions, I make the assumption that people who typically play a Stradivarius violin are violin masters whether or not they own the instrument themselves.</p>
<p>Here are examples related to the acquisition and maintenance of skill mastery, as demonstrated on a Stradivarius. In interstellar space.</p>

<p>Acquiring mastery in an uncommon skill takes uncommon effort.</p>
<p>It takes so much effort that acquiring an uncommon skill often also requires family and economic support. A small percentage of those who play the violin will pursue the instrument for over a decade of focused study and practice to have a chance to attain a level of mastery.</p>
<p>Those future interstellar humans’ new environment may not allow for them to put in that uncommon effort. Or, just as dangerous, where today there is a community of masters to practice and play with, in the future interstellar state, there may be so few masters that a string quartet is never possible. Less humans to practice and play with is probably assured.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/The_Dark_Forest">ravine-like</a> global crash that eliminates all violin players, teachers, and even knowledge of classical music is a possibility. What happens when there is no place to which the players can escape, survive, and continue until the situation improves? The ravine impacts violinists regardless of location.</p>
<p>Without a continual string of teachers and students, mastery becomes mystery and impossible to acquire. With effort put on making humans interstellar, will there be energy left for mastery of the violin?</p>

<p>Life in interstellar environments may not allow people to maintain an extreme practice regimen or to build excellent finger dexterity. There’s just no excess capacity to do so. They could in theory acquire the skills but never have time or physical capability.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol’s Cost Disease</a> explains why certain types of work become more expensive over time. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151936/http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/782/TOWSE%20EBOOK_pages0103-0113.pdf">It takes four musicians as much playing time to perform a Beethoven string quartet today as it did in 1800</a>.” That’s without considering the amount of time to acquire mastery in playing the instruments.</p>
<p>In an interstellar society, while people may have excess free time, learning to play with mastery excludes people from other, more productive activities. Spending years to become a violinist has an opportunity cost that could be more extreme than today. Longer lifespans might shift that somewhat.</p>

<p>It’s possible that skill acquisition advances beyond current imagination make it possible for novices to become masters overnight. If that happens and future humans value violin mastery, then perhaps it is more likely to see violin masters in the future, whether in interstellar environments or earth.</p>

<p>It will certainly be possible to build a robot with equal or better manual dexterity to a human. So in the future, even if there is a ravine, perhaps the robots will be preferred as violinists and will play every Strad. Why risk the instruments in human hands?</p>

<p>Why listen to live performances if, at least for classical music, there are no masters around to play live or they are worse than high-quality immersive recordings (or robots)?</p>
<p>It’s possible that future violinists play mostly for themselves.</p>

<p>Music has a shelf life. It’s long for some genres and pieces and short for others. The status quo of the classical repertoire can only be preserved for so long.</p>

<p>Consider what happened to music in the 20th century. The development of good quality microphones and electronic effects led to many new forms of music including the broad types of rock, disco, and rap. Those musical genres were created in part when musicians learned how to apply new technology. The same thing will happen again, as musicians (human or otherwise) apply music technology in new ways.</p>
<p>It’s possible that classical music will no longer be all that good in comparison to future music. Classical music’s popularity has been falling for the past 100 years since the genre stopped being pop music.</p>

<p>It’s worth considering that the original Stradivarius violins will eventually be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html">too fragile to play</a>. Cremona, Italy (where Stradivari worked) has been recording at high-quality the sound of each potential note of its Stradivarius violins in order to preserve that sound for posterity. Can anyone really expect to play a 1,000 year old violin?</p>

<p>Future humans may prevent Stradivarius violins and many other other examples of earth’s artistic mastery from leaving earth. Then again, future humans may want a certain number of Strads to leave as a hedge against future destruction.</p>

<p>Humans are not objective in their appraisal of violins. A double-blind <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/21/5395">study of violinists</a> (they wore goggles) playing modern and Stradivarius violins challenges the belief that Stradivarius is the best. The Strads are often valued in the millions because of their history, and most would claim, their sound. But the overwhelming majority of the violinists in the experiment preferred the modern violins. This is not to say that humans should just accept a forced preference in violin. An argument for why Strads sound (or seem to sound) better has been made from a <a href="http://www.brandstoryonline.com/stradivarius-violins-better/">brand perspective</a>, of all things. It’s the same argument made for fine (expensive) art: that part of the value, maybe most of the value, comes from things that are not objective. Story and history have a big impact on value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some skills will become impossible to acquire when humans make a large environmental change. These skills are not transferable across vastly different environments and are lost.</li>
<li>Skill loss happens all the time in human history, though certain events speed it up.</li>
<li>Some events make skill loss impossible to undo.</li>
<li>Future humans will deal with different unintended consequences if they build an interstellar society.</li>
<li>Can we build a set of rules to help us assess unintended consequences from dramatic environmental changes?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m currently writing a series of articles about test frameworks, and it got me thinking about the importance of software testing. Ever since I started writing automated tests almost a decade ago, I’ve found them to be <strong>one of the most useful tools for building maintainable software</strong>, but I still meet developers who don’t write tests.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s because their boss (or the business team) won’t give them time, sometimes it’s because they’ve never been told about the benefits of testing, and sometimes they just don’t care.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kR3EGD6.jpg" alt="Can't stop fixing bugs long enough to write tests"></p>
<p>Fortunately, if the reason you’re not writing tests is one of the first two, there’s hope. You <em>can</em> point to real business value generated by testing, and it doesn’t take a huge software system or a long period of time to do so.</p>
<p>Just remember that <strong>your time as a developer is incredibly valuable</strong>, so when you say that you can save yourself (and future software developers) time, your manager can attach real dollars to the problem. In this post, I’ll introduce you to automated software testing and give you the reasons you can take to your boss to make the case for writing tests.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>Before I jump into the benefits, I want to make sure you understand what I mean when I say “automated tests.”</p>
<p>Software can be tested manually (traditionally, this means passing your work to a quality assurance team), and it can be tested automatically. In the latter case, developers write code that ensures their code is working. These automated tests are often run using a command-line interface, and almost every programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks">has a testing framework available</a>.</p>
<p>Unit tests are probably the most widely talked about form of automated test, but there are others. I’ll briefly cover them here, but it will require a dedicated article to do this topic justice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit tests</strong> focus on the smallest possible unit of code - typically a function or class. They are fast to run, and you will usually have a lot of them.</li>
<li><strong>Integration tests</strong> ensure that interlocking pieces of your application work together as designed. Sometimes this means testing the layers between classes, and sometimes this means testing the layer between your database and application.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance tests</strong> are a slightly broader form of integration test. In practice, I use this term to refer to service-level tests.</li>
<li><strong>End-to-end tests</strong> ensure that the entire system works as designed. This means that the frontend and backends are working and talking to one another to accomplish a series of user stories. These are the most time-consuming tests to run, and typically you won’t write as many of them.</li>
<li><strong>“Smoke” tests</strong> are final checks that ensure your recently deployed code is working as intended. They could be as simple as a ping to your API after a deployment to make sure it responds with a <code>200 OK</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Performance tests</strong> ensure your application meets its SLAs by testing how long it takes to handle requests under load. These may be run on every production deployment or - because they’re so complicated and expensive - just when major new features are released.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in specific examples of testing patterns, I’ve written about <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-strat-2017-presentation">API testing</a> and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">microservice testing</a> in the past. Those posts should be an excellent place to turn next if you want examples you can apply to your application.</p>
<h2 id="why-software-testing-is-important">Why Software Testing is Important</h2>
<p>The business problem with testing is that it’s not immediately apparent that you need them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You write a piece of code, and you know it works. You just wrote it. You just ran it…Six months pass. It is time to refactor your code. You would kill for some tests. - <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/you-dont-need-tests">Swizec Teller, You don’t need tests</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The diagram below illustrates this point. Initially, the cost of writing no tests or manually testing your code is much lower than writing automated tests. This is because setting up an automated test suite, and getting developers familiar with a test-driven workflow will take some time.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.karllhughes.com/assets/img/cost-of-tests-over-time.png" alt="The cost of automated software tests over time"></p>
<p>Eventually though, maintaining code without tests will lead to costly production bugs, and a manual testing strategy scales linearly (as you add more code, testers must spend more time doing tests). So in the long-run, automated tests make maintaining your code cheaper.</p>
<p>But why is this the case?</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-testing">The Benefits of Testing</h2>
<p>Let’s look at testing from the standpoint of a developer. Once you spend six months on a team that’s consistently writing automated tests, you’ll see the benefits. Here are the things that stand out to me:</p>
<h3 id="1-testing-minimizes-bugs">1. Testing Minimizes Bugs</h3>
<p>Bugs are expensive, and production bugs are the worst offenders. According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965523_Integrating_Software_Assurance_into_the_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_SDLC">the IBM System Sciences Institute</a>, fixing a production bug costs 100x more than fixing one at design and over 15x more than fixing a bug at implementation. Automated tests can help developers catch edge-case bugs before they make it into production and force other developers to drop everything and fight fires.</p>
<h3 id="2-automated-tests-prevent-regressions">2. Automated Tests Prevent Regressions</h3>
<p>In addition to catching new bugs, a strong automated test suite can help prevent regression. As <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-every-unit-test-needs-f6cd34d9836d">Eric Elliot</a> says, “Manual QA is error-prone…It’s impossible for a developer to remember all features that need testing after making a change to refactor, add new features, or remove features.”</p>
<p>Testing becomes even more important when multiple developers are working on the project over many years. Newcomers can’t safely work on code that doesn’t have tests. While you can rely solely on manual tests, this cost grows linearly as the number of features increases, while automated tests can be written once and run very frequently for little to no cost.</p>
<h3 id="3-writing-testable-code-improves-overall-quality">3. Writing Testable Code Improves Overall Quality</h3>
<p>Code quality is another long-term investment that <a href="https://writing.pupius.co.uk/velocity-vs-quality-3d0417fba991">pays off for large software systems</a>. Unit testing can dramatically improve quality when working with developers who are still learning about encapsulation, dependency injection, and scoping, and it is even more advantageous in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">weakly typed languages</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When every new class must have unit tests, it forces developers to stop and think about their architectural choices.</strong></p>
<h3 id="4-tests-enhance-documentation">4. Tests Enhance Documentation</h3>
<p>Good code should be easy to read and at least partially <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?SelfDocumentingCode">self-documenting</a>, but there’s almost always room for use-case based documentation. That’s where testing comes in. Good test suites give other developers (or maybe just future you) a better idea of what the code was intended to do.</p>
<h3 id="5-tests-help-guide-code-reviewers">5. Tests Help Guide Code Reviewers</h3>
<p>As an important part of the development process, reviewing code can be tedious. Having tests gives the reviewer a place to look for potential errors or missed edge cases. During code reviews, I often start with the tests, ensuring that they are well-written and don’t miss any important cases <em>before</em> I look at the actual code.</p>
<h3 id="6-tests-make-it-easier-to-add-new-features">6. Tests Make It Easier to Add New Features</h3>
<p>Code gets naturally harder to change the more interconnected and older it is. Tests counter this tendency towards calcification by helping developers add new features more confidently. As a new developer, changing older parts of your codebase can be really scary, but with tests, at least you’ll know if you broke something important.</p>
<h3 id="7-tests-can-help-you-debug-edge-cases">7. Tests Can Help You Debug Edge Cases</h3>
<p>Finally, I use tests to help debug edge cases that show up in production. For example, if we start to see a problem in the logs that wasn’t showing up in testing, I’ll try to write a test case that causes the same error. Once reproduced in a test, I use this as a blueprint to fix the issue and ensure it doesn’t show up again.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-testing">How to Get Started Testing</h2>
<p>If you’re brand new to testing, this all probably sounds a little intimidating. How do you set up a test suite? Should you do purely test driven development? What if your team isn’t supportive? What about adding tests to a legacy application?</p>
<p>These questions can be overwhelming, even for an experienced software developer.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started contributing to an open-source project that had almost zero test coverage. Worse, there were a few tests that the original maintainer had written, but he hadn’t bothered to fix as the library evolved. The tests were now failing, but the application was working.</p>
<p>I started to consider my options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I try to put a stop to new feature development until we got the tests fixed?</li>
<li>Should I stop using the library until it meets the quality standards I wanted?</li>
<li>Do I try to rewrite the whole thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Extreme solutions like this can be tempting, but they rarely make good business sense. Implementing tests on an untested app is a process. Much like the <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/technical-maturity">technical maturity level of a startup</a>, you can’t expect every application to be perfect, but you can make gradual improvements to the test coverage and testability of an application as you work on it.</p>
<p>Here’s how I approached the problem:</p>
<h3 id="1-start-with-end-to-end-tests">1. Start With End-to-End Tests</h3>
<p>Unit tests usually require refactoring, so while they’re great when you’re building an application from scratch, it’s easier to start by writing higher-level acceptance or end-to-end tests for a working application. An automated test that makes sure all the critical features work the whole way through is a great place to start.</p>
<h3 id="2-test-return-types">2. Test Return Types</h3>
<p>The next thing to test is the most mission-critical methods in the most important classes. Even if the code is a spaghetti string mess, you can start by testing the return type from the method. If mocking dependencies isn’t possible, then it’s okay to write some impure tests to get started. Refactoring isn’t safe until you’ve got at least some tests in place.</p>
<h3 id="3-add-tests-one-piece-at-a-time">3. Add Tests One Piece at a Time</h3>
<p>Unit testing a large application takes time and patience. Install a code coverage tool, and start with one small piece at a time. If it’s a big project and it’s going to take a few weeks, so try doing a few classes per week rather than taking the whole thing on at once. This is a good thing for developers who are new to a project to do as it helps them get familiar with the application without being required to change core functionality.</p>
<h3 id="4-start-refactoring">4. Start Refactoring</h3></div></article></section></div>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshbressers">Josh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtseifried">Kurt</a> talk about the safety and liability of new devices. What happens when your doorbell can burn down your house? What if it’s your fault the doorbell burned down your house? There isn’t really any prior art for where our devices are taking us, who knows what the future will look like.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>22 Nov 2020<br>22 Nov 2020</p><p><em>TL;DR. We focused on a holistic view of our candidates (technical and interpersonal skills) while trying to be fair with everyone’s time and life experiences. We could identify the outstanding people and those that weren’t a good fit and have had a great experience working with our hires!</em></p><p>After reading <a href="https://www.neilwithdata.com/developer-hiring">The software industry’s greatest sin: hiring</a> by Neil Sainsbury and <a href="https://andrewrondeau.com/blog/2020/04/take-home-vs-whiteboard-coding-the-problem-is-bad-interviews">Take-home vs. whiteboard coding: The problem is bad interviews</a> by Andrew Rondeau, several critical points about interviewing software developers stood out to me:</p><ul><li>Software developers are usually assessed based on technical aspects ignoring their personal and organizational qualities. This might produce technically correct software with good performance, but that might be far from fulfilling users’ needs.</li><li>Someone can be technically excellent but lack the skills to understand and interact with your users and the rest of the team.</li><li>Someone can be technically excellent but keep using technologies they find interesting but are not aligned with the company’s goals.</li><li>There are tradeoffs between whiteboard and take-home questions: time invested by both parties, different development environment/conditions, visibility of the candidate’s technical and personal qualities, and the feedback loop between the examiner and the applicant.</li><li>A key aspect is to plan a good interview with coding assignments that consider the company’s needs and are fair for everyone involved.</li><li>Presenting existing code is briefly discussed by Andrew Rondeau as an alternative to whiteboard and take-home questions.</li></ul><p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at a group that explores mobile data’s role in monitoring or supporting people with different health conditions. Broadly speaking, we collect smartphone and wearable sensor data, process it, and use it to create statistical and machine learning models that provide relevant behavioral or clinical insights. This is possible thanks to our team’s multi-disciplinary nature with expertise in psychology, statistics, computer science, software engineering, and data science.</p><p>Recently, we needed to hire a couple of data science interns from the local master’s program, and I was in charge of leading the technical part of the interviews. This was an excellent opportunity for me to pilot the type of technical interview that I’d like to experience based on the points I summarized above and the lab’s needs.</p><p>I divided our interviews into two 30-minute stages, one to talk about one of the candidate’s past projects and the other to find out how they would approach a data science problem that represents the kind of work we do.</p><p>For the first stage, we asked applicants to submit in advance a past data science project that they would like to discuss with us. I want to clarify that we accepted any industry, school, or hobby code repository and did not judge its purpose or complexity. We don’t expect that everyone will have the time to work on side-projects in their free time or disclose code from a previous employer. However, their sample project allowed us to understand some of the person’s experience with data science and software engineering practices like data cleaning, modeling, documentation, version control, variable and function naming, code comments, code formatting, and code refactoring. If any of these aspects were missing or seemed unsatisfactory, we made a note and ask about them during the interview.</p><p>When the time came for the first part of our face-to-face chat (where we talked about their chosen project), we focused on their hard skills (technical expertise, domain knowledge, and problem-solving abilities), soft skills (communication, multi-disciplinary collaboration, feedback reception), and traits like proactiveness, enthusiasm, motivation, clarity of thought, independence and attention to detail. This is our take on what Neil refers to as a candidate’s “holistic” view. Crucially, having technical and non-technical members from our team present made it easier to discuss and evaluate our candidates. More specifically, we inquired people about their role in previous teams (if any), their approach to learning, and their thought process to choose the best tool for the job. We also prompted them to explain complex non-technical concepts to everyone in the interview panel and to talk more about their experience interacting with past “clients” (teachers, fellow students, or any other stakeholders for those with experience in Industry). One of the advantages of this setup was that it allowed everyone to interact in a work environment very similar to what we experience every day while planning, implementing, executing, analyzing, and publishing a health intervention or monitoring study.</p><p>In the second part of the interview, we asked participants the following question: how would you implement a sleep classifier based on smartphone and Fitbit data? Even if this problem appears simple at first sight, numerous decisions and considerations can be taken into account along the way. For example, we can talk about missing data, feature engineering, data resampling, data imputation, class imbalance, type of model (population or individual), hyper-parameter tuning, model choice, baselines, cross-validation, evaluation metrics, etc. Consequently and to foster the discussion, we always dropped clues, clarifications, and follow up questions.</p><p>We did not expect our interviewees to reach a comprehensive solution or write any code (it took us weeks to finish a publishable solution, and the first part of the interview already would have given us an idea of their programming skills). Instead, we wanted to know more about their thinking process. We paid particular attention to the candidate’s understanding of the problem (do they ask relevant questions?), creativity (how do they suggest tackling this problem?), experience (are they levering solutions to past problems?), technical expertise (what programming language, libraries, or methods would they like to use?), and communication skills (can they engage the whole team in the discussion?).</p><p>This process fits well within our workflow and our team’s characteristics, and we hope that by sharing it, you can adapt it to your needs and provide a better experience for your candidates.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>When a company with millions of consumers such as DoorDash builds machine learning (ML) models, the amount of feature data can grow to billions of records with millions actively retrieved during model inference under low latency constraints. These challenges warrant a deeper look into selection and design of a feature store — the system responsible for storing and serving feature data. The decisions made here can prevent overrunning cost budgets, compromising runtime performance during model inference, and curbing model deployment velocity.</p>



<p>Features are the input variables fed to an ML model for inference. A feature store, simply put, is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/key-value/">key-value store</a> that makes this feature data available to models in production. At DoorDash, our existing feature store was built on top of <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, but had a lot of inefficiencies and came close to running out of capacity. We ran a full-fledged benchmark evaluation on five different key-value stores to compare their cost and performance metrics. Our benchmarking results indicated that Redis was the best option, so we decided to optimize our feature storage mechanism, tripling our cost reduction. Additionally, we also saw a 38% decrease in Redis latencies, helping to improve the runtime performance of serving models.</p>



<p>Below, we will explain the challenges posed in the task of operating a large scale feature store. Then, we will review how we were able to quickly identify Redis as the right key-value store for this task. We will then dive into the optimizations we did on Redis to triple its capacity, while also uplifting read performance by choosing a custom serialization scheme around strings, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">Snappy</a> compression algorithm.</p>



<h2>Requirements of a gigascale feature store</h2>



<p>The challenges of supporting a feature store that needs a large storage capacity and high read/write throughput are similar to the challenges of supporting any high-volume key-value store. Let’s elaborate upon the requirements before we discuss the challenges faced when meeting these requirements specifically with respect to a feature store.</p>



<h3>Persistent scalable storage: support billions of records</h3>



<p>The number of records in a feature store depends upon the number of entities involved and the number of ML use cases employed on these entities. At DoorDash, our ML practitioners work with millions of entities such as consumers, merchants, and food items. These entities are associated with features and used in many dozens of ML use cases such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a> and cart item recommendations. Even though there is an overlap in features used across these use cases, the total number of <em>feature-value</em> pairs exceeds billions.</p>



<p>Additionally, since feature data is used in model serving, it needs to be backed up to disk to enable recovery in the event of a storage system failure.</p>



<h3>High read throughput: serve millions of feature lookups per second</h3>



<p>A hit rate of millions of requests per second is a staggering requirement for any data storage system. The request rates on a feature store are directly driven by the number of predictions served by the corresponding system. At DoorDash, one of our high volume use cases, <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a>, makes more than one million predictions per second and uses dozens of features per prediction. Thus, our feature store needs to support tens of millions of reads per second.</p>



<h3>Fast batch writes: enable full data refresh in a nightly run</h3>



<p>Features need to be periodically refreshed to make use of the latest real world data. These writes can typically be done in batches to exploit batch write optimizations of a key-value store. At DoorDash, almost all of the features get updated every day, while real time features, such as “average delivery time for orders from a store in the past 20 minutes”, get updated uniformly throughout the day.</p>



<h2>Specific design challenges in building a feature store</h2>



<p>When designing a feature store to meet the scale expectations described above, we have to deal with complexities that are specific to a feature store. These complexities involve issues such as supporting batch random reads, storing multiple kinds of data types, and enabling low-latency serving.</p>



<h3>Batch random reads per request add to read complexity</h3>



<p>Feature stores need to offer batch lookup operations because a single prediction needs multiple features. All key-value stores support unit lookup operations such as Redis’s <a href="https://redis.io/commands/get">GET command</a>. However, batch lookups are not a standard especially when keys are in no particular sequence. For example, <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra</a> doesn’t support batch random lookups.</p>



<h3>Heterogeneous data types require non-standardized optimizations</h3>



<p>Features can either be simple data types such as integers, floats, and strings, or compound types such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2018/04/02/personalized-store-feed-with-vector-embeddings/">vector embeddings</a> or lists. We use integers or strings for categorical features such as <em>order protocol,</em> for whether an order was received by merchants via email, text, or iPad. We use lists for features such as a <em>list of cuisines chosen by a customer in the past 4 weeks.</em> Each one of these data types needs to be individually treated for optimizing storage and performance efficiency.</p>



<h3>Low read latency but loose expectations on write latency</h3>



<p>A feature store needs to guarantee low-latency reads. Latency on feature stores is a part of model serving, and model serving latencies tend to be in the low milliseconds range. Thus, read latency has to be proportionately lower. Also, typically, writes and updates happen in the background and are much less frequent than reads. For DoorDash, when not doing the batch refresh, writes are only 0.1% of reads. Low-latency requirements on reads and loose expectations with writes gives a direction for building towards a read-heavy key-value store but one that is fast enough for large batch writes.</p>



<h2>Identifying the right key-value store by benchmarking key performance metrics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The choice for an appropriate storage technology helps greatly in increasing the performance and reducing the costs of a feature store. Using Yahoo’s cloud serving benchmark tool, <a href="https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB">YCSB</a>, we were able to identify Redis as a key-value store option that best fit our needs.</p>



<h3>What we need from a benchmarking platform</h3>



<p>Before we lay out our benchmarking setup, it is worthwhile to emphasize key requirements of a benchmarking platform. The four major required capabilities of a benchmarking setup are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Data generation using preset distributions</li></ul>



<p>Using data generation is a faster and more robust approach to benchmarking than ingesting real data because it accounts for possible values that a system’s random variables can take and doesn’t require moving data around to seed a target database.</p>



<ul><li>Ability to simulate characteristic workloads</li></ul>



<p>The workload on a database can be defined by the rate of requests, nature of operations, and proportions of these operations. As long as we can guarantee the same fixed request rate across tests, we can enable a fair comparison between the different databases.</p>



<ul><li>Fine-grained performance reporting</li></ul>



<p>The suite should be able to capture performance with appropriate statistical measures such as averages, 95th percentile, and 99th percentiles.</p>



<ul><li>Reproduction of results on demand</li></ul>



<p>Without reproducibility, there is no benchmark, it’s merely a random simulated event. For this reason, any benchmark platform needs to be able to provide a consistent environment where the results can be reproduced when running the same test over and over.</p>



<h3>Using YCSB to do a rapid comparison of key-value stores</h3>



<p>YCSB is one of the best benchmarking tools out there for analysing key-value stores. So much so that it not only meets all of the needs we described above but also provides sample code to benchmark a vast number of key-value stores. This setup ensures we have a flexible playground for rapid comparisons. Below, we describe our approach of using YCSB to validate our selection of Redis as the best choice for a feature store. We will first describe our experiment setup and then report the results with our analysis.</p>



<h2>Experiment setup</h2>



<p>When setting up the benchmarking experiment, we need to start with the set of key-value stores that we believe can meet the large scale expectations reliably and have a good industry presence. Also, our experiment design is centered around Docker and aims to optimize the speed of iterations when benchmarking by removing infrastructure setup overheads.</p>



<h3>Candidate set of key-value stores</h3>



<p>The key-value stores that we experimented on in this article are listed in Table 1, below. <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>, and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> have a presence in the DoorDash infrastructure, while we selected <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a> based on market reports and our team’s prior experience with these databases. The intention was to compare Redis as an in-memory store with other disk-based key-value stores for our requirements.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Database name</strong></td><td><strong>Version</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cassandra</td><td>3.11.4</td></tr><tr><td>CockroachDB</td><td>20.1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Redis</td><td>3.2.10</td></tr><tr><td>ScyllaDB</td><td>4.1.7</td></tr><tr><td>YugabyteDB</td><td>2.3.1.0-b15</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>Table 1.</em> We considered five<em> data stores for benchmarking, three that were in current use at DoorDash and two others that showed promise in external market reports.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Data schema</h3>



<p>For data storage, we chose following patterns:</p>



<ul><li>SQL/Cassandra</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="sql">CREATE TABLE table (key varchar primary key, value varchar)</code></pre>



<ul><li>Redis</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="bash">SET key-value
GET key</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I like to think I’m a pretty rational investor. Not too emotional, not too prone to FOMO, willing to wait for good deals. So, let me tell you about a bad and embarrassing decision I made. This story may seem pretty dumb to you, as it does to me today. I often read about great financial disasters and think “that’s so stupid! I would never screw up this badly.” It turns out that’s easier said than done; some theoretical lessons are very hard to internalize in practice.</p> <p>In late 2014, I was cautiously bullish on Bitcoin. I saw the appeal of finite-supply assets in other markets, leaned cypherpunk-libertarian, and had run into many issues with fiat payment processors in my poker days. However, I had also seen Liberty Reserve shut down by the FBI, watched quaint early scams like Auroracoin, and thought it seemed clear that the government would eventually need to shut down this state-threatening Wild West.</p> <p>So I was bullish, but hesitant to put real skin in the game. Along came an opportunity to bet on Bitcoin with no personal downside: I met a young founder who had just raised $2M from a few investors for the purpose of getting them Bitcoin exposure. Let’s call him Mephisto. He had negotiated 25% carry on the profits of his small fund, which was an excellent deal. His track record made sense: he’d been in the industry since 2012, and had made some good money on Bitcoin and trading FPGAs. He had brought on a young woman – let’s call her Bellatrix – to help manage operations. As we talked, we realized I could help them generate alpha beyond pure Bitcoin exposure. I knew financial derivatives very well, so my task was broadly to profit off inefficiencies in these nascent markets.</p> <p>I was 23. Working with Mephisto and Bellatrix was like sitting on the Hindenburg. While I was combing the market for inefficiencies, they were struggling to get the operations fully set up. A few weeks in, it turned out that Mephisto and Bellatrix had been fucking in secret. They had an equity dispute. He went off his medication, and suffered a psychotic breakdown. She accused him of rape. They called the cops on each other. He disappeared and re-encountered the substance abuse problem that had put him on anti-psychotic medication in the first place. To top it all off, they lost the cold storage credentials for a few weeks.</p> <p>I pulled the escape cord and resigned cleanly. Ironically, I took a financial loss here, since I had to have my lawyers review everything and ensure I wasn’t liable for any fiduciary mismanagement these two chaos clowns might undertake.</p> <p>At this point it was early 2015. Bitcoin hovered between $200 and $250 per coin. I was totally over it. The cautiously bullish view I had gotten around to was eviscerated by my distaste for the Mephisto episode. I was exasperated, liquidated nearly my entire position and sat, for a long time, more in the bear camp than not. Thinking about Mephisto and Bellatrix, I said to myself, if <em>this</em> is who is managing money in Bitcoin, there’s no hope for the sector. Bearish on Bitcoin at a $3B market cap.</p> <p>Part of my attitude was a spiteful emotional hedge. I think my reasoning went like this: investing in Bitcoin could go two ways. I could lose money, and I would be disappointed. I could also make money, but in that case, Mephisto and his ilk would make wildly <em>more</em> money, and I would be upset. If I were to invest and succeed holding the same position as Mephisto, I’d be envious of someone I despised. I wanted Mephisto to fail, so I wanted Bitcoin to fail. It’s a twisted rationalization – silly in retrospect, of course.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p>It’s easy to be a rational investor when the seas are calm. It’s hard when it gets emotional. Importantly, everyone has a threshold – if the personal relationships are close enough, or if the stress is great enough, suddenly even the most rational actors crack. I saw it all the time playing poker: your opponents are stone-faced rational actors until something gets to them. They’re tired or distracted, and suddenly they get pissed off when they normally wouldn’t, and make bets they shouldn’t. Very few people manage to stay rational in charged moments. The better-disciplined folks will summon all their willpower just to walk away.</p> <p>In this episode, I let emotional stress override my assessment of the market. Stupidly, I let my subjective, one-off personal experience bias me against an entire industry. Stress had me do a 180 on a carefully considered position of conviction. Refusing to take a position out of spite, or in order to pre-empt envy in the case of success, is even more embarrassing.</p> <p>Finally, there was one other important thing I hadn’t considered or realized at the time: the cutting edge is always full of idiots. It’s a common trope that people who are all-in on frontier tech are usually somewhat crazy. We have a romantic view of folks on the frontier – eccentric geniuses – but much of the time it’s gullible bozos and scammers feeding off them. In a historical analogy, the Wild West does not just create outlaws, it necessarily attracts them. My mistake here was to let the worst people color my representation of the market. It doesn’t matter how many scammers and con-men there are, it matters how many people are building stable infrastructure. It doesn’t matter how many ways there are for it to fail, it only matters that there’s one plausible way to succeed.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>A Passport is a document that almost everyone has at some point in their lives. It is issued by the country’s government to its citizens and mainly being used for traveling purposes. It also serves as proof of nationality, name, and more importantly an <strong>Universally Unique ID</strong> for its owner.</p>
<p>Modern Passport Structure</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.pixlab.xyz/oJY2K.png" alt="Passport Specimen"></p>
<p>Many services have been long-time accepting passports as identification documents from their customers to <strong>complete their KYC (<em>Know Your Customer</em>) form</strong> as required by the legislation in force. This is especially true and enforced for the <em>Finance</em>, <em>HR</em> or <em>Travel</em> sectors. In most cases, a human operator will verify the authenticity of the submitted document and grant validation or reject it.</p>
<p>Things can get really complicated if you have hundreds of KYC forms to checks, but also if your clients differ in nationality. Quickly, you will find yourself drowning in physical copies of passports in different languages that you can not even understand. Let alone the potential legal problems you can face with passport copies laying around the office. This is why, an automated &amp; safe solution for Passports processing is required!</p>
<h2>Modern Passport Structure</h2>
<p>From the 1980s on wards, most countries started issuing passports containing an <strong>MRZ</strong>. MRZ stands for the <strong>Machine Readable Zone</strong> and is usually located at the bottom of the Passport as shown below:</p>
<p>Modern Passport Specimen</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwJTo.jpg" alt="Passports MRZ Sample"></p>
<p>Passports that contain an MRZ are referred to as <strong>MRPs, machine-readable passports</strong> (Almost all modern issued Passports have one). The structure of the MRZ is standardized by the <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303">ICAO Document 9303</a> and the International Electro-technical Commission as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45562.html">ISO/IEC 7501-1</a>.</p>
<p>The MRZ is an area on the document that can easily be read by a machine using an OCR Reader Application or API. It’s not important for you to understand how it works, but if you look at it carefully, you will see that it contains most of the relevant information on the document, combined with additional characters and a checksum that can be extracted programmatically and automatically via API as we will see in the next section.</p>
<p>Once parsed, the following information are automatically extracted from the target <strong>MRZ</strong> and made immediately available to your app, thanks to the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>issuingCountry</strong>: The issuing country or organization, encoded in three characters.</li>
<li><strong>fullName</strong>: Passport holder full name. The name is entirely upper case.</li>
<li><strong>documentNumber</strong>: This is the passport number, as assigned by the issuing country. Each country is free to assign numbers using any system it likes.</li>
<li><strong>checkDigit</strong>: Check digits are calculated based on the previous field. Thus, the first check digit is based on the passport number, the next is based on the date of birth, the next on the expiration date, and the next on the personal number. The check digit is calculated using this <a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/mrp.html#checkdigit">algorithm</a>.</li>
<li><strong>nationality</strong>: The issuing country or organization, encoded in three characters.</li>
<li><strong>dateOfBirth</strong>: The date of the passport holder's birth in YYMMDD form. Year is truncated to the least significant two digits. Single digit months or days are perpended with 0.</li>
<li><strong>sex</strong>: Sex of the passport holder, <strong>M</strong> for males, <strong>F</strong> for females, and <strong>&lt;</strong> for non-specified.</li>
<li><strong>dateOfExpiry</strong>: The date the passport expires in <strong>YYMMDD</strong> form. Year is truncated to the least significant two digits. Single digit months or days are perpended with 0.</li>
<li><strong>personalNumber</strong>: This field is optional and can be used for any purpose that the issuing country desires.</li>
<li><strong>finalcheckDigit</strong>: This is a check digit for positions 1 to 10, 14 to 20, and 22 to 43 on the second line of the MRZ. Thus, the nationality and sex are not included in the check. The check digit is calculated using this <a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/mrp.html#checkdigit">algorithm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Automatic Passport Processing</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.pixlab.io/content/images/20201106031815-pix.png" alt="PixLab Logo"></p>
<p>Fortunately for the developer wishing to automate Passports scanning, <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">PixLab</a> can automatically scan &amp; extract passport MRZ but also help to detect possible fraudulent documents. This is made possible thanks to the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint which let you in a single call scan government issued documents such as <strong>Passports</strong>, <strong>Visas</strong> or <strong>ID Cards</strong> from various countries.</p>
<p>Besides extracting MRZ, the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=crop">shall automatically crop</a> any <strong>detected face</strong> and transform binary <strong>Machine Readable Zone</strong> into stream of text content (i.e. <em>full name</em>, <em>issuing country</em>, <em>document number</em>, <em>date of expiry</em>, etc.) ready to be consumed by your app in the JSON format.</p>
<p>Below, a typical output result of the /<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45562.html">docscan</a> endpoint for a passport input image:</p>
<p>Input Passport Specimen (JPEG/PNG/BMP Image)</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.pixlab.xyz/oJY2K.png" alt="Input Image URL"></p>
<p>Extracted MRZ Fields</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.pixlab.xyz/docscan_output.png" alt="MRZ Fields"></p>
<p>What follow is the gist used to achieve such result:</p>

<p>Other document scanning code samples are available to consult via the following Github links:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python code for scanning Passports</strong>: <strong><a href="https://github.com/symisc/pixlab/blob/master/python/passport_scan.py">passport_scan.py</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PHP code for scanning Passports</strong>: <strong><a href="https://github.com/symisc/pixlab/blob/master/PHP/passport_scan.php">passport_scan.php</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Face extraction is automatically performed using the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facedetect">facedetect</a> API endpoint. For a general purpose Optical Character Recognition engine, you should rely on the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=cor">OCR</a> API endpoint instead. If you are dealing with PDF documents, you can convert them at first to raw images via the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=pdftoimg">pdftoimg</a> endpoint.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The era we are in is more digitized than ever. Tasks that are repetitive are slowly being replaced by computers and robots. In many cases, they can perform these tasks faster, with a smaller amount of mistakes and in a more cost-effective manner. At <a href="https://pixlab.io/">PixLab</a> we focus on building software to replace manual repetitive labor in administrative business processes. The processing and checking of passports can be very time-consuming. Using /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> to automate your passport processing will enable you to save cost, on-board customers faster and reduce errors in administrative processes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Twice this week I was asked how it can be okay to work on free software when there are issues like climate change and racial injustice. I have a few answers for that.</p>
<h3>You can work on injustice while working on free software.</h3>
<p>A world in which all technology is just cannot exist under capitalism. It cannot exist under racism or sexism or ableism. It cannot exist in a world that does not exist if we are ravaged by the effects of climate change. At the same time, free software is part of the story of each of these. The modern technology state fuels capitalism, and capitalism fuels it. It cannot exist without transparency at all levels of the creation process. Proprietary software and algorithms reinforce racial and gender injustice. Technology is very guilty of its contributions to the climate crisis. By working on making technology more just, by making it more free, we are working to address these issues. Software makes the world work, and oppressive software creates an oppressive world.</p>
<h3>You can work on free software while working on injustice.</h3>
<p>Let’s say you do want to devote your time to working on climate justice full time. Activism doesn’t have to only happen in the streets or in legislative buildings. Being a body in a protest is activism, and so is running servers for your community’s federated social network, providing wiki support, developing custom software, and otherwise bringing your free software skills into new environments. As long as your work is being accomplished under an ethos of free software, with free software, and under free software licenses, you’re working on free software issues while saving the world in other ways too!</p>
<h3>Not everyone needs to work on everything all the time.</h3>
<p>When your house in on fire, you need to put out the fire. However, maybe you can’t help put out the first. Maybe You don’t have the skills or knowledge or physical ability. Maybe your house is on fire, but there’s also an earthquake and a meteor and a airborn toxic event all coming at once. When that happens, we have to split up our efforts and that’s okay.</p>

<p>Today I’m going to see if I can use a PC water cooling kit to make a water cooled Raspberry Pi 4. I’ve seen a couple of people try this on older model Pi’s, using reducers and adapters to get to a small cooling block onto the CPU, but I’m going to try and make an adapter to fit a larger 30mm cooling block onto a Pi 4.</p>



<p><span data-ez-name="the_diy_life_com-box-3"></span>Just to be clear, this is totally unnecessary and is more of a let’s do it because we can, not because we should type of project.  But we’ll have fun building it anyway, and hopefully it works well in the end!</p>

<p>I bought a kit that included a 120mm fan and a radiator, a 12V pump, a reservoir and some tubing. These kits are commonly available online for significantly less than the name brand components sold for high-end PCs, but it’s still quite expensive just to mess around with.</p>

<p>The kit also included a full size CPU cooling block. It looks quite cool (excuse the pun) but is way too big to try and fit onto the Pi, so I’m going to be using one of these smaller 30 x 30mm blocks which can accommodate a half-inch or 12mm tubing.</p>

<h2>Building The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<h3>Mounting The Cooling Block To The Pi</h3>



<p>I’m going to start out by making a bracket to hold the cooling block in place on the Pi over the CPU. </p>

<p>We’ll need a square section to locate the block and hold it down onto the CPU and then some legs off to the four mounting holes to hold it in place. I’ve tried to avoid covering the GPIO pins and the major components, the bracket will be quite high up, so won’t interfere with any of the surface mount components.</p>

<p>I cut the two parts for the bracket out on my laser cutter from 3mm fluorescent green acrylic.</p>

<p>The cooling block can’t be mounted straight onto the CPU as the display connector is too high. We’ll need to put a spacer in between the CPU and cooling block to lift it above the display connector, with enough room for the tubes. </p>

<h2>Making The Cooling Circuit Stand</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve got our cooling block mounted onto our Pi, we can start working on mounting the rest of the cooling circuit. </p>

<p>Rather than just connecting all of the components together on a desk, I decided to design a stand to mount the water cooling components and Raspberry Pi, so that it looks more complete.</p>



<p>I’m going to use clear acrylic for the stand with some fluorescent green legs to match the cooling block bracket. The water cooling components should just bolt straight onto this sheet once it’s been cut out.</p>

<p>Again, I cut this stand out on my laser cutter from 3mm acrylic, this time clear.</p>



<p>Now that we’ve got our stand components made, lets start putting them together. </p>

<p>I’ll start by mounting the reservoir, pump and radiator onto the stand.</p>

<p>Next, I need to glue the Raspberry Pi stand components onto the main cooling water stand. I clamped the components in place and allowed the cement to cure for a couple of hours before trying to mount the Pi.</p>

<p>Once the glued had properly cured, I put two lengths of tubing onto the heat sink so that I didn’t have to try push them on in the tight space between the Pi and the pump, and then mounted the Pi onto the stand using four nylon M3 nuts on the bottom of the standoffs.</p>

<p>I then added the fittings and finished off the tubing.</p>



<p>One side of the cooling block goes to the pump and the other to the radiator. We also need a section of tube from the radiator to the top of the reservoir.</p>



<p>The last thing to do is to add a small acrylic block to the base of the pump to hold the weight of the pump and reservoir. The legs on the stand are not strong enough to support all of the cooling components and I didn’t want to make them bigger as I like the look of the thinner sections. You’ll also hardly notice the block under the pump if it’s clear.</p>

<p>Our water cooled Pi is now complete, we just need to fill it up with water or cooling liquid and try it out. The system took around 300ml of cooling liquid to fill.</p>



<h2>Testing The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<p>The fan and pump are actually quite quiet when running, the system is a lot quieter than some of the small case fans I’ve used on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Now let’s try and do a stress test on the water cooled Raspberry Pi to see how well this cooling system works.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 1.5GHz</h3>



<p>With the CPU clock frequency set to the default 1.5Ghz, we start out with a temperature of around 28°C. This was in a room of around 25°C, so it was done with quite a warm ambient temperature. </p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the test.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 2.0GHz</h3>



<p>Now I’m going to try overclocking the Pi to test it at a higher CPU frequency. </p>

<p>I set the CPU frequency to 2.0Ghz for this test.</p>



<p>Let’s try doing a stress test and see what we get.</p>

<p>For this test we started out with a temperature of around 29°C, which then quickly spiked to 39°C when the test was started.</p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the 2Ghz test.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The water cooling system on this Pi works really well at keeping the CPU cool. Even when overclocked to 2.0Ghz, the  Raspberry Pi 4’s CPU temperature never went above 40°C. I wasn’t able to test the Pi at the maximum 2.147Ghz as my Pi wouldn’t boot up at this frequency, probably due to under-voltage. I’ll try and get this fixed and do a test at the maximum frequency as well at some stage.</p>



<p>To get an idea of whether this is worthwhile, I’m going to be comparing this water cooling system to an <a href="https://www.the-diy-life.com/diy-raspberry-pi-4-desktop-case-with-oled-stats-display/">Ice Tower</a>, a standard acrylic case and fan and then just a Pi with a static heat sink on it in the next week or two. So make sure that you check back here, or subscribe to my Youtube channel and turn on notifications so that you don’t miss out on that.</p>

              <strong>The Complete Turing Machine</strong></p></span></p>
            <p><span>The <em>Universal Turing Machine</em> (or 
              UTM) is well known. It is a Turing machine that takes as input a 
              binary representation of a Turing machine and a binary representation 
              of some arbitrary input and simulates the workings of the specified 
              Turing machine on the specified input. </span></p>
            <p><span><em>In what follows we'll assume three 
              tape Turing machines (input, work, output), with a binary alphabet, 
              where 0 corresponds to an unmarked square and 1 is marked. Input 
              to the Turing machine is assumed to be finite (i.e. there are only 
              finitely many 1s on the tape). While I speak of a single input, 
              it could easily encode finitely many individual binary strings into 
              the single binary string.</em></span></p>
            <p><span>Less well known is what I call the <em>Complete 
              Turing Machine</em>. It simulates in parallel all Turing machines 
              on all input. There is a small trick to this, but it is not difficult. 
              Since Turing machines can go on forever, we can't wait for one to 
              finish before simulating the next, but have to simulate them in 
              parallel. It is easy enough to simulate two Turing machines in parallel, 
              performing a step from the first then a step from the second and 
              so forth:</span></p>
            <p><span>step 1 of machine 1, step 1 of machine 
              2, <br>
              step 2 of machine 1, step 2 of machine 2, <br>
              ...</span></p>
            <p><span>This approach can only interleave finitely 
              many infinite sequences, but we require infinitely many Turing machines. 
              Thankfully, there is a well known trick to interleave infinitely 
              many infinite sequences into a single infinite sequence. For example:</span></p>
            <p><span>step 1 of machine 1, <br>
              step 2 of machine 1, step 1 of machine 2,<br>
              step 3 of machine 1, step 2 of machine 2, step 1 of machine 3<br>
              step 4 of machine 1, step 3 of machine 2, step 2 of machine 3, step 
              1 of machine 4<br>
              ...</span></p>
            <p><span>In this way, every Turing machine gets 
              to execute every step (if a Turing machine halts we just skip over 
              each remaining step allocated to it).</span></p>
            <p><span>We could specify a first draft of the Complete 
              Turing Machine in C-like pseudocode:</span></p>
            <div><p>for (i = 0; ; i++)<br>
              {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialise_tm(tm[i], 
              i);</p><p>
              
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (j = 0; j &lt;= 
              i; j++)<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compute_next_step(tm[j]);<br>
              }</p></div>
            <p>tm[] is an (extendable) array of representations 
              of configurations of Turing machines including information about 
              their transition tables, their current tape, their current state, 
              and the location of the tape head. It starts uninitialised.</p>
            <p>initialise_tm(tm, i) is a function that 
              initialises a Turing machine representation to start in the starting 
              state, with a blank tape, the tape head at the start position, and 
              using the ith transition table (on some recursive coding of all 
              legal transition tables).</p>
            <p>compute_next_step(tm) is a function that 
              takes such a representation and simulates a single computational 
              step on it. It is a standard core part of a Universal Turing machine.</p>
            <p><span>This will simulate all Turing machines 
              (including non-terminating ones) running on a blank input tape.</span></p>
            <p><span>We actually want all Turing machines on 
              all inputs, but we can achieve this by a small modification to the 
              initialisation function. Instead of using i as a code for a transition 
              table, it now treats i as coding a pair of natural numbers (<em>x</em>, 
              <em>y</em>) (on some recursive coding of all pairs of naturals) 
              then initialises the Turing machine to use the <em>x</em>th 
              transition table and sets the input tape to the <em>y</em>th 
              input tape (on some recursive coding of all finitely marked input 
              tapes). Since the coding guarantees that all (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) 
              pairs will be in this list (possibly using an ordering like the 
              triangular one above), each transition table, input pair will be 
              initialised at some point and every step of their computations will 
              be run.</span></p>
            <p><span>So far so good. We now have a machine that 
              will simulate all Turing machines on all finite inputs. The existence 
              of such a Turing machine is known, but not all that well known. 
              This is a shame, because it is a pretty amazing thing: in some ways 
              much more amazing than the Universal Turing machine. Firstly, it 
              computes all Turing computable functions (and evaluates them on 
              all inputs). Obviously it also semi-computes all Turing semi-computable 
              partial functions (it evaluates them on all inputs where there is 
              a defined answer). </span></p>
            <p><span>However, thinking of what it does in terms 
              of functions misses most of the glory of this machine. Consider 
              sorting a finite list of natural numbers. This is a Turing computable 
              function, but can be done in many ways. There is quick sort, merge 
              sort, insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, and all their 
              friends. The CTM doesn't just sort lists, it sorts them using each 
              and every one of these distinct algorithms. It even sorts them with 
              every subtle variation on each of these algorithms.</span></p>
            <p><span>At the first level of simulation, the CTM 
              simulates all and only Turing machines. What about programs in C? 
              Or functional and logical languages such as Haskell and Prolog? 
              Or unusual models of computation like neural nets. We might think 
              that there are algorithms that can be expressed in these types of 
              languages which can't be expressed on a Turing machine and we'd 
              like to simulate these too. Well, for each of these there is a Turing 
              machine that acts as an interpreter for that language, and there 
              is also a Turing machine that uses such an interpreter to run all 
              programs in that language on all inputs (analogous to the CTM itself). 
              So the CTM simulates a Turing machine which simulates all Haskell 
              programs and another which simulates all Prolog programs and another 
              which simulates all neural networks etc. The CTM's calculation thus 
              includes simulations of all programs in all Turing complete languages 
              and sub-Turing languages (most of which are yet to be invented) 
              which are run on all inputs, but they are nested one level down 
              — simulations inside simulations.</span></p>
            <p><span>The CTM also simulates physical phenomena. 
              If our universe is Turing computable, then it will be simulated 
              by this CTM. Indeed since there are infinitely many Turing machines 
              that express the same algorithm, it will be simulated infinitely 
              many times in parallel. The CTM will also simulate it with every 
              possible recursive set of initial conditions. In between these threads 
              will be simulations of the hailstone numbers, chess, tropical cyclones, 
              the game of life, lolcats, and this entire simulation itself. </span></p>
            <p><span><strong>Adding oracular computation</strong></span></p>
            <p><span>What can't a CTM simulate?</span></p>
            <p><span>I'm sure many readers will immediately 
              think of their favourite uncomputable function or process. Others 
              will think of counting arguments: there are only a countable infinity 
              of Turing machines and there are an uncountable infinity of processes, 
              so almost all of them must be impossible to simulate. For example, 
              consider an endless simulation of an empty room with a light bulb 
              that flashes on and off: for each one minute block of time, the 
              light stays on or stays off, but at the end of each minute it may 
              or may not change to the other state. There are uncountably many 
              such sequences of flashes, as they correspond directly to the infinite 
              bitstrings (e.g. a string where the <em>n</em>th bit is 1 if and 
              only if the light is on during the <em>n</em>th minute). There are 
              thus uncountably many lightbulb simulations, and so not enough Turing 
              machines to be able to simulate all of them. Similarly, there is 
              a lightbulb simulation whose pattern of flashes spells out a lookup 
              table for the halting problem and we're going to have a lot of trouble 
              simulating that one.</span></p>
            <p><span>This is a compelling argument. Surprisingly 
              it is wrong.</span></p>
            <p><span>It turns out that we can simulate all such 
              sequences of flashing lights so long as we do them simultaneously. 
              </span></p>
            <p><span>Let's start with two parallel simulations: 
              one with the light off for the first minute and one with it on. 
              We then fork each of these simulations, simulating both ways the 
              next minute could go. We continue in this way, forking all the existing 
              simulations at each stage and having an exponentially …</span></p></div></div>

            <p>If you’re a founder, you know that fundraising isn’t easy for pre-product or pre-revenue startups. Most venture funds don’t want to invest in companies that have no product or no traction. After all, startups at this stage have done very little to de-risk their businesses.</p><p>But, some VC’s look to invest in startups at this stage. These pre-seed investors want to write the first check to companies and founders they believe in. Often, they invest alongside angel investors and other pre-seed venture capital firms via convertible notes or SAFEs. Sometimes, they invest in companies on their own.</p><p>Several VC funds only back pre-seed startups. Others invest in a mix of pre-seed, seed, and Series A companies. <strong>To make it easier for you to raise a pre-seed round for your startup, we've compiled a list of investors who participate at this stage and you can view it below. </strong>If you'd like to download the full database of investors and their notable portfolio companies, you can purchase it below.</p><p>We'll continue to update this database as we find more VC’s who make pre-seed investments. If your fund invests in pre-seed companies and doesn’t appear on this list, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@founderhelp.co">hello@founderhelp.co</a> and we'll be happy to add it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
