<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>I recently read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt’s</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenberg_(technologist)">Jonathan Rosenberg’s</a> book about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works">How Google Works</a>. While most content does not necessarily translate to academia, I think their list of rules for successful meetings does.
In this post, I will reiterate the list and comment on their applicability in academia. In general, all rules are also valid for non-academic meetings, but since I haven’t worked in industry for quite a while, I feel more comfortable taking the academic (PhD student) point of view. As you will see, I believe it’s the PhD student’s/junior researcher’s responsibility to make a meeting successful, and therefore, I want to stress that my/our meeting culture is by no means perfect, and I myself sometimes struggle to adhere to these rules.</p>

<p>Even though decision making is more and more outsourced to *your favorite communication platform* messages, in-person meetings (even virtual ones) are a much better tool to meet on an equal footing and reach mutual decisions. A proper meeting culture is therefore indispensable.</p>

<p><strong>*rage on*</strong><br>
My main concern with instant messengers is that we frequently begin to write in a tone in which we would not talk in-person, or worse: our communication partner “hears” a destructive tone in our messages that was not intended to be there. We all know this, yet we are quick in dismissing doubts about the language we chose; after all, only the content counts. I can assure you that it is impossible to read only the content; we will always question the motifs behind a message, which can be a problem if they are not clearly communicated. Humans love to “read between the lines”.
<br><strong>*rage off*</strong></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think Slack et al. are great tools that increase efficiency, but when it comes to important or potentially sensitive topics, meetings should be preferred, and the following rules might help to make them more successful<sup><a href="#fn_order">1</a></sup>:</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-1-rule-1-have-an-agenda-span"><span id="rule_1">Rule 1: Have an agenda</span></h5>

<p>The first rule is actually not part of E&amp;J’s list; it is a no-brainer to have an agenda in industry. In academia, this is not always the case (e.g., ad-hoc meetings to “discuss an idea”). Even if it is just 3 bullet points in your head, <strong>know the meeting’s objective</strong> and communicate it to the attendees. Objectives are critical to keep the meeting on track and determine whether the meeting was successful. Sometimes the goal of a meeting is just to update others. For such meetings, I like to have two main threads: 1) I did this, and these are the results, and 2) This is where I got stuck, and need help with. I think the objective of an “update meeting” is never <em>only</em> to update others but always to also get help with the challenges you’re facing.</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-2-rule-2-meetings-should-have-a-single-decision-maker-owner-span"><span id="rule_2">Rule 2: Meetings should have a single decision-maker/owner </span></h5>

<p>Eric and Jonathan argue that there should be one person whose butt is on the line for making a decision, typically a person of high seniority. This is very tricky in academia, as sometimes the more senior person is not the one whose butt is on the line. Imagine you’re a PhD student, and you meet with your PI. While your PI comes up with 10 new ideas on improving your paper, which is 90% finished, it is <strong>your</strong> missed opportunity if you fail to include the 10 new aspects in time. In this case, the decision-maker should be the PhD student. Naturally, a decision should be reached together, and there are plenty of situations in which it makes sense to adhere to a “top-down” decision. However, <a href="#rule_5">Rule 5</a> underlines my reasoning.</p>

<h5 id="rule-3-if-you-attend-a-meeting-attend-the-meeting">Rule 3: If you attend a meeting, attend the meeting</h5>

<p>Close your laptop<sup><a href="#fn_laptop">2</a></sup>. Be attentive. Otherwise, don’t be there at all. If you have the feeling you are not needed, then the decision-maker should not have invited you.  If you have the urge to be on the phone or laptop, ask yourself: “Is my time really better spent doing task X, or am I doing someone a disservice by not properly attending this meeting?”. If you are the instigator of the meeting and have the feeling that people are not attentive, tell them. Also, ask them why they are not attentive (do this offline). You might also rethink your decision of whom to include next time.</p>

<h5 id="rule-4-meetings-are-not-like-government-agencies-they-should-be-easy-to-kill">Rule 4: Meetings are not like government agencies – they should be easy to kill</h5>

<p>This is a very important one: If the meeting’s purpose can’t be achieved, the decision-maker has to ask the hard question: Does it make sense to continue the meeting? This is true for recurring meetings (e.g., in 1-on-1s, we can ask: is it beneficial to continue the weekly schedule, or would a bi-weekly meeting be enough, or does this format not work at all?) and ongoing meetings (e.g., is everyone present we need to reach a decision?)</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-5-rule-5-the-decision-maker-should-be-hands-on-span"><span id="rule_5">Rule 5: The decision-maker should be hands on</span></h5>

<p>More often than not, the PhD student is the one who does the dirty work. She is the one who thinks and ruminates about one specific problem for hours and days. She comes up with ideas, trashes them, gets frustrated, and tries again. This is why she should “[…] call the meeting, ensure the content is good, set the objectives, determine the participants, and <strong>share the agenda</strong> (if possible)” to quote E&amp;J. Unfortunately, the last point is rare in academia; see <a href="#rule_1">Rule 1</a>.</p>

<h5 id="rule-6-even-if-a-meeting-is-not-a-decision-making-meeting-it-should-have-a-clear-owner">Rule 6: Even if a meeting is not a decision-making meeting it should have a clear owner</h5>

<p>In academia, the majority of our meetings are to update or brainstorm. I argue that in both scenarios, the PhD student should be the owner who takes care that there is a clear agenda, and all participants were able to prepare for the meeting. Ideally, the objectives of the meeting are shared a couple hours before the meeting takes place.</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-7-rule-7-meetings-should-be-manageable-in-size-span"><span id="rule_7">Rule 7: Meetings should be manageable in size</span></h5>

<p>E&amp;J recommend not more than eight people and ten at a stretch, and <strong>everyone</strong> should give their input. In big collaborations, this can be hard and makes the following even more important: Have proper communication channels for people who should know the meeting results but were not crucial to reaching a decision.</p>

<h5 id="rule-8-attendance-at-meetings-is-not-a-badge-of-importance">Rule 8: Attendance at meetings is not a badge of importance</h5>

<p>If you are not needed, don’t participate. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done since, often, politics still play a significant role in academia. Some scholars think it is essential to “show presence” even though their involvement in the project is negligible. I am convinced that you can spend your time more productively than by participating in meetings for projects you’re not actively involved in. Technically, <a href="#rule_7">Rule 7</a> should take care of this issue.</p>

<h5 id="rule-9-timekeeping-matters">Rule 9: Timekeeping matters</h5>

<p>A problem I observed a lot in meetings, is that they get into “overtime” <em>before</em> the core problems were solved. This is because scholars love to discuss details, and every itsy bitsy issue needs to be completely solved before we can continue. However, we should not only start our meetings on time but also end them with a proper summary of the findings. Of course, this requires to have a reasonable agenda and maybe even a time assignment for each topic. I would also recommend having a <strong>“rabbit hole watcher”</strong> who drags us out of the rabbit holes that our attention to detail digs for us.</p>

<p>In summary, there are a lot of crucial factors that determine the success of a meeting. If I had to pick a single rule, I’d go for <a href="#rule_2"> Rule 2</a>. If the owner of the meeting is genuinely interested in a positive outcome, she will naturally think about the majority of the other rules herself, and importantly will set objectives which make the success measurable.</p>

<p><span id="fn_order">1. Eric and Jonathan did not order their rules, I tried to order them by importance based on my (limited) experience.</span> <br>
<span id="fn_laptop">2. Unless you need it for note taking.</span></p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 17 Jul 2020</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time"><a href="#optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time</a></h2>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

<p>
That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.
</p>

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0201-0301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0301-0401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0401-0501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0501-0601: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0801: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1001: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of
        others which might be inapplicable or even wrong.</p>

<p>A ready-to-install jupyter extension which converts english queries into relevant code. Built as a proof of concept for the problem we personally face of <strong>forgetting less-used syntaxes of pandas and plotly libraries</strong> which is often used in Exploratory Data Analysis. This tool allows us to query in a generic language without having to remember the syntax.</p>

<p>Inspired by cool GPT-3 demos and not having the access to the API, here is an attempt by us to build a Text2Code extension using publicly available libraries. The approach isn't generative, but relies on identifying &amp; matching from a set of predefined <em>intents</em> and generating the relevant code by extracting relevant entities and inserting them in a template. Adding new intents and extending the functionality is easy once the pipeline is in place. </p>

September 7, 2020 | https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/469bfa00bd6320832992e9fc5c2ed4a061f868ff/64a71/img/next-js-with-wordpress-part-1-blog-post.png" alt="Blog article on configuring WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js"></p>
<p>Welcome to the first in a series of articles on getting started with Next.js. In this very first starting point, we'll be looking at creating a brand new Next.js project using the very helpful <code>create-next-app</code> tool.</p>
<p>From there, we'll be setting up WordPress as a headless CMS to manage our blog posts' content for us.</p>
<p>As we move through future articles in the series, we'll be covering a lot of moving parts to round out the entire process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting a blog using Next.js,</li>
<li>Using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js,</li>
<li>Creating an RSS feed for our static Next.js blog</li>
<li>Bundling, building and deploying our Next.js static blog with Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>For this very article, however, we're just going to start with the basics of getting Next.js and our headless WordPress instance setup and ready to go.</p>
<p>So let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Why Next.js</h2>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/" title="Next.js from Vercel">Next.js</a> (made by a company called <a href="https://vercel.com/" title="Vercel static website hosting">Vercel</a> — formally Zeit) is a React-based framework for producing static-generated websites. It fills in some of the blanks of using React in its vanilla form, such as dynamic page routing, and it also allows developers a bevvy of choices of where to get their data from to power their static websites.</p>
<h3>Isn't it just like Gatsby</h3>
<p>It's very comparable to <a href="https://nextjs.org/" title="Next.js from Vercel">Gatsby</a> (which I also love) in many ways. Indeed Next.js and Gatsby share the same end goal: to connect data with a static-generator engine to produce a static website.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer Next.js the more I use it. Whilst Gatsby offers a more mature eco-system with its plugins and community, Next.js offers a much less complex setup and often requires fewer plugins to achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>I'd recommend trying both and seeing which you prefer.</p>
<h2>Why use WordPress as a headless CMS</h2>
<p>WordPress is an often maligned platform, but it does power something close to 35% of the entire web. It's a hugely popular content management platform and most people have come across it, if not directly used it at some point during their time.</p>
<p>However, it does have a reputation for being quite clunky at times and it takes some work to produce a performant website on the front end.</p>
<p>One of the best reasons to consider WordPress as a headless CMS is that it solves the largest problem facing static-generated websites: editing content!</p>
<p>Sure, for most developers (me included) this isn't so much of a burden. For example, I use <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="Forestry.io markdown CMS">Forestry.io</a> as a markdown editor/CMS to edit the markdown files that power this very site directly in my GitHub repo.</p>
<p>Other developers may choose to just edit HTML directly, and that's fine and dandy.</p>
<p>But what about 'normal' users, marketers, content editors, <em>non-developers</em>?! Editing markdown or HTML files is a bit beyond their needs or, perhaps, their skillsets.</p>
<p>By using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js, it's win win win. Website visitors get performant, accessible websites. Developers get a great developer experience and aren't hampered by the very opinionated and clunky PHP development required for WordPress. And content producers and site owners still get to use their favourite content management tool, WordPress, to handle the editing process!</p>

<h2>Step 1, getting WordPress ready for Next.js</h2>
<p>Installing and getting a WordPress instance going is beyond the scope of this article and there are many places to help get you started with that.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a recommendation then check out <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/" title="Amazon Lightsail hosting">Amazon's Lightsail</a>, or the AWS platform in general as there are often free tiers available, especially whilst you're just getting started.</p>
<p>What we're bothered about here is adding some necessary bits and pieces to a WordPress website to turn it into a headless CMS for Next.js to access.</p>
<p>So, assuming you already have a WordPress instance set up, let's move on.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e8f504d6e8834e2f39467d5d570671a22ab328f0/15fa3/img/nextjs-demo-robkendal.jpg" alt="Demo WordPress website from Rob Kendal"></p>
<p>(PS - if you want to use my demo site, which I'm using in this article, then you can check it out here - <a href="http://demo.robkendal.co.uk/" title="Demo WordPress website for linking to Next.js">http://demo.robkendal.co.uk/</a></p>
<h3>Installing WPGraphQL (and plugins)</h3>
<p>Out of the box you can use the WordPress REST API to fetch data and so on, but we're going to be using GraphQL to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>This does mean we have to install a few plugins, however, before we can start accessing our data via Next.js.</p>
<p>So, we'll be heading over to <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/" title="WPGraphQL plugin">https://www.wpgraphql.com/</a> and we'll want to install the following plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases" title="WPGraphQL plugin">WPGraphQL main plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf" title="WPGraphQL for ACF plugin">WPGraphQL for ACF</a> (advanced custom fields)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql" title="WPGraphiQL plugin">WPGraphiQL</a> - a visual query builder/explorer for GraphQL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>with the WPGraphQL stuff, you'll have to visit those links, download the Source Code (zip) as zip files and upload them to WordPress manually via the Admin Menu &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload dialog.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/20fccd08ff42eab3a803c36749a5dd5476913b33/abf82/img/nextjs-article-wpgraphql.jpg" alt="WPGraphQL releases plugin download page"></p>
<p>The reason for favouring GraphQL is that it's faster than the REST API and GraphQL gives us the power and flexibility to return only the data we need. Using the WPGraphiQL plugins also allows us to both build our queries directly inside of our WordPress instance before moving them into Next.js</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is hugely important as we can see the output of the queries, testing and tweaking them as we go, <em>before</em> we have to blindly add them to our local dev instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll also need once last plugin, <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" title="WordPress Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF). This will allow us to add extra fields to our posts or pages to extend their content capabilities.</p>
<h3>Adding custom fields to posts</h3>
<p>Next, and this part is optional if you don't want/need custom fields on your posts, we'll set up a few custom fields using ACF and make sure they're enabled for WPGraphQL, <strong>otherwise they won't show up</strong>.</p>
<p>Head over to your WordPress admin console and then to Custom Fields &gt; Field Groups and make a new one, calling it whatever you like.</p>
<p>For my site, I called the Field Group 'Extra Post Info'. Then, I added three fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>Author Excerpt - a text area field</li>
<li>Preview Image - a simple image selection field</li>
<li>Thumbnail Image - as above</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2e1688bc8fe3a58371879f35d13803da2b0b4138/fc5ae/img/nextjs-article-acf-setup.jpg" alt="WordPress ACF fields setup"></p>
<p>You can add whatever fields you wish and name them to suit your needs.</p>
<p>From here, scroll all the way to the bottom of this page and enable the WPGraphQL settings as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure <code>Show in GraphQL</code> is set to 'Yes'</li>
<li>For <code>GraphQL Field Name</code> set this to a meaningful and descriptive name for your extra fields. This will be the name we use to reference the extra fields in GraphQL. Here, I named mine <code>extraPostInfo</code></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cb9f2bf0cdbde1947b3f8fb306f0372b14404522/b0110/img/nextja-article-ac-graphql-settins.jpg" alt="WPGraphQL settings to enable custom fields to show up"></p>
<p>And that's that. One final thing is to populate a few dummy posts in the Posts section of the admin menu. Just create a handful of new posts and add in whatever content you wish (I find Lorem Ipsum works just fine here).</p>
<h3>Viewing our Posts in GraphQL</h3>
<p>Having installed all the necessary WPGraphQL posts, added some extra fields, and made sure those were added to the GraphQL schema, with some dummy Post content in place, we can go check out the Posts data via the WPGraphiQL explorer.</p>
<p>Head over to the GraphiQL menu item in your WordPress admin console.</p>
<p>Now for the real magic! GraphiQL is a visual query builder that lets you simply expand and toggle data fields on the left hand side, build a query in the middle using those data fields, and execute that query to see what data is returned.</p>
<p>Very powerful stuff, I'm sure you'll agree. Now, the in's and out's of GraphQL language and the GraphiQL tool are entire articles and courses in themselves, but you can find out more from the <a href="https://graphql.org/" title="Official GraphQL website and documentation">official GraphQL website</a>.</p>
<p>For our purposes, you can see below that I've expanded various paths on the tree menu, starting with <code>posts</code> and this has automatically built me a query in the centre editor panel. When I pressed the big play button, the query is executed and the results shown in the rightmost panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d7b87cf1fd0717aa70ffdf2ac855c7351e9db3be/6a9ed/img/nextjs-article-graphiql-query.png" alt="GraphiQL query data builder"></p>
<p>The query built looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    query MyQuery {
      posts {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            date
            title
            slug
            featuredImage {
              node {
                mediaItemUrl
              }
            }
            extraPostInfo {
              authorExcerpt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns something along the lines of this data:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "posts": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "cG9zdDoyOA==",

<p>At this time, it is now better for you to write content like a human, with personality, and natural.</p>
<p>If you know a subject well, Google especially can sense that. If you are faking, google can sense that too.</p>
<p>Bing search engine likely has comparable talents. Other <em>search engines don’t even matter anymore</em>, as they (such as Duckduckgo and Yahoo) actually source their results from Bing.</p>
<p>Whereas domain authority was previously calculated by backlinks and social network cues, the algos can now sense from your writing alone, along with a multitude of other cues…if you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>On this subject, here is some light reading for you… <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf</a> (E-A-T)</p>

<h3 id="backlinks-hardly-matter">Backlinks… Hardly Matter</h3>
<p>Before, in SEO, you had the burden of building backlinks. Backlinks helped search engines understand the context of your site and it’s possible popularity and authority.</p>

<p>If I spoke to you with no less than 1000 words, you might be annoyed. You would, most likely, be very, annoyed, angered, frustrated, sad.</p>
<p>You get it? The Algorithms practically have emotions now. They don’t want to hear you talk like that either.</p>
<p>They don’t like SEO tricks.</p>
<p>Don’t use them.</p>
<hr>

<p>Unless you really are a popular person, don’t bother. Sure, social network traffic is great. But artificial popularity on a social network (ie, an army of admiring sock puppets talking about you… doesn’t help anymore). Search engines know who’s real and who’s not (mostly).</p>

<p>Now that search engines are smarter, you are officially relieved of the burden of SEO. You can be your best you, and you will now thrive for it.</p>

<![CDATA[Pragmatic MVU with React and TypeScript]]>

September 7, 2020 | https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update-with-react-and-typescript | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update-with-react-and-typescript">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
    
    <p>With the introduction of hooks, React got some compelling new instruments – including useReducer, which can be used to implement Model-View-Update within a React component.</p>
    
    <p>While probably intended to "hook up" developers experienced in working with Redux, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer">useReducer</a> at the same time opens the door for implementing The Elm Architecture, aka Model-View-Update (MVU) quickly and pragmatically.</p>
<h2>The Core Idea</h2>
<p>If you don't know what MVU is and want to learn more first, check out my article on <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update">how it works</a>. If you are impatient, I can offer you a shortcut:</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasbandt.com/upload/mvu.png" alt="MVU"></p>
<p>From my perspective, the whole thing's essential idea is to make changes to the state explicit and easy to reason about. That is achieved through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data is flowing uni-directionally.</li>
<li>Having a view that is a function of the state (model).</li>
<li>Having an update function that is the only place where state changes.</li>
<li>Communicating through messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is fair to argue that 1. and 2. are already core principles of React itself. However, <code>useReducer</code> adds 3. and 4. to the game.</p>
<h2>A Practical Example</h2>
<p>Without further ado, let's go through it based on a little example, a login form.</p>
<h3>What Are The Requirements?</h3>
<ol>
<li>There are a user name and a password field, and a submit button.</li>
<li>The button must only be enabled when the user name and password are provided.</li>
<li>When the button is clicked, some work shall be done (e.g., validation/network request).</li>
</ol>
<h3>The State</h3>
<pre><code>interface State {
  userName: string;
  password: string;
  isValid: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  userName: "",
  password: "",
  isValid: false,
};
</code></pre>
<p>That's as unspectacular as necessary, as the core information we are working with is defined at a central place. So whenever you want to access the user name or password, you don't need to go to the form itself.</p>
<h3>The Messages</h3>
<pre><code>type UserNameChangedMsg = {
  type: "UserNameChangedMsg";
  userName: string;
};

type PasswordChangedMsg = {
  type: "PasswordChangedMsg";
  password: string;
};

type Msg = UserNameChangedMsg | PasswordChangedMsg;
</code></pre>
<p>While the definition of messages is not as lean as in other languages (in F#, this would have been a three-liner), TypeScript, fortunately, supports <a href="https://mariusschulz.com/articles/tagged-union-types-in-typescript">Tagged Union Types</a>, which do the job.</p>
<h3>The View</h3>
<pre><code>export default function () {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(update, initialState);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="text"
        placeholder="User name"
        defaultValue={state.userName}
        onChange={(e) =&gt;
          dispatch({ type: "UserNameChangedMsg", userName: e.target.value })
        }
      /&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        defaultValue={state.password}
        onChange={(e) =&gt;
          dispatch({ type: "PasswordChangedMsg", password: e.target.value })
        }
      /&gt;
      &lt;button disabled={!state.isValid} onClick={() =&gt; signIn(state)}&gt;
        Sign in
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now things are getting more interesting. Let's go through it:</p>
<pre><code>const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(update, initialState);
</code></pre>
<p>There it is, our <code>useReducer</code> hook. Calling it returns two things: The current <code>state</code> and a <code>dispatch</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>state</code> can be used to render the view depending on its properties. For example, as required, the sign-in button is only enabled when <code>state.isValid</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>dispatch</code> function is used to "fire" messages: Whenever the user changes the user name or the password, the corresponding message is being dispatched. Note that it contains the element's value as its payload, for example, in the case of the password:</p>
<pre><code>onChange={(e) =&gt;
  dispatch({ type: "PasswordChangedMsg", password: e.target.value })
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, two questions come up: What happens when a message is being dispatched? And how does <code>state.isValid</code> ever become true?</p>
<h3>The Update Function</h3>
<pre><code>function validate(state: State): boolean {
  return state.userName.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; state.password.length &gt; 0;
}

function update(state: State, msg: Msg) {
  switch (msg.type) {
    case "UserNameChangedMsg": {
      const newState = { ...state, userName: msg.userName };
      return { ...newState, isValid: validate(newState) };
    }
    case "PasswordChangedMsg": {
      const newState = { ...state, password: msg.password };
      return { ...newState, isValid: validate(newState) };
    }
  }
  return assertUnreachable(msg);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here it is, the U of MVU, our <code>update</code> function. Its signature is defined by the <code>useReducer</code> hook: It accepts the latest known state and a message it is supposed to process.</p>
<p>Based on some magic of the TypeScript compiler, it is possible to switch through the messages based on the discriminant property type, which all of them provide.</p>
<p>Depending on the message type, we now know what should be changed, <code>userName</code> or <code>password</code>, and so we do. We also set the <code>isValid</code> property, which becomes only true when both the user name and the password contain at least one character.</p>
<p>Side note: The whole thing is exhaustive, which is achieved by the little helper function <code>assertUnreachable()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>function assertUnreachable(x: never): never {
  throw new Error("Didn't expect to get here");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever our tagged union <code>Msg</code> gets a new case, the compiler will notice, and the build will fail â€“ until we add that case to the switch.</p>
<h3>Commands?</h3>
<p>If you already know about MVU, you might have noticed that there are no commands yet. And there won't be any â€“ the <code>useReducer</code> hook doesn't know about the concept of commands. That's why I call it a pragmatic approach.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of the world as it is possible to work around it for most cases. For example, when our sign-in button is enabled and gets clicked, we call another function and pass the current state:</p>
<pre><code>function signIn(state: State) {
  // Do something here ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could validate the credentials, make network requests, or do whatever we like. And if the result would be a change of our state, we could pass the dispatch function and dispatch a message from within here.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The example may seem relatively trivial, even too insignificant to use that MVU approach. But if you chose to go down that route, it will come with all the benefits listed above â€“ even for such a relatively simple component.</p>
<p>And once you follow the pattern in more and more components of your application, you will notice that behavior reasoning will become much more straightforward.</p>
<p>PS: See <a href="https://gist.github.com/aspnetde/93bf9cbbac76b7c36b59015ec47cabdf">here</a> for the complete code of the component.</p>

  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/014b39cd15c61584a080d634e68a0861129d628b/1a9e4/uploads/bad-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In our <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/good-business-name/">last article</a> of the Business Naming series, you learned that good company names will make you SMILE – and which successful brands apply these criterias. Now, just applying the five SMILE-criterias to a name is not enough: A good name does not only make you smile, it will also not be a head-SCRATCHer.</p>

<p>So, in this article, you will learn what makes a bad company name – so you can avoid these pitfalls with your own brand. There are 7 deal-breaking points to be aware of, following the handy acronym SCRATCH:</p>

<p><strong>Spelling-challenged</strong>: A name isn’t spelled how it sounds like. in the 2000s, a lot of Tech startups did that to secure domains and look unique. The issue: Just from hearing the name, you couldn’t replicate and spell it correctly, which causes trouble when remembering the the brand. In name brainstorming meetings, this is usually the first idea: “Let’s take a word and spell it differently” – please don’t do that. Famous brands that you know (and probably misspelled at first) include Flickr, Lyft or Houzz. Pro tipp: Ask Siri if she knows your company and see how she spells it.</p>

<p><strong>Copycat</strong> – Remember your last beach vacation? The sun, the smell of fresh coconuts and the beach salesman offering the finest garments from Calvin Kline, Guggi, Dolce &amp; Banana. If your brand name is too close to your competition’s, you will end up not only getting sued by them, but perceived as unoriginal and lame. That’s also true if you think of opening a Burger Queen’s or a Jamie and the Juice.</p>

<p><strong>Restrictive</strong> – You know who has a hard time selling anything else but seafood? Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. If your name is very precise on only one aspect of your business, it will lock you in and limit future growth.</p>

<p><strong>Annoying</strong> – Your brand name should not be indecipherable, forced or cutesy – any kind of leaving out letters, play on words or puns will rather hurt your brand perception than help it.</p>

<p><strong>Tame</strong> – Do you know what “Simple” does? Or “Life”? Or “Tune”? All of these are real brand names, they are short, positive, and totally tame. Avoid names that don’t dare or are not specific enough</p>

<p><strong>Curse of Knowledge</strong> – When you are using subculture references or language for your skate shop or surf school, your audience might really enjoy the insider joke. This curse of knowledge however excludes everyone else, and your brand from growing outside the core demographic.</p>

<p><strong>Hard-to-pronounce</strong> – Again, your name doesn’t need to have any artsy qualities. While something like Cartier or Hermès might work in the luxury sector, their pronunciation does exclude the rest of us. If your name is not obvious or you rely on accents or punctuation, try to find a simpler name.</p>

<p>For good brand names, try to avoid any of these head scratchers. To audit your own brand name, try out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FR3b-ZmeO32uI_sqLRQTACCnEdwZP8Qgi549R9kmFI/edit#gid=0">Human Deluxe SMILE &amp; SCRATCH Matrix</a> on Google Sheets – it’s free, of course!</p>

    <p>In 2018, I started working at Bloomberg. Things have changed a lot since. I’m not the most junior member in the company anymore and I’ve mentored quite a few new engineers, which has been amazing. It helped me observe how others differ from me, absorb their best practices, and figure out things I’ve unconsciously been doing pretty well.</p>

<p>Yearly work reviews are a good way to condense these lessons I’ve learned.  They’re valuable for pattern matching, too. Only when I zoom out do certain patterns become visible. I can then <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html">start tracking these patterns consciously</a>.</p>

<p>The broad theme for this year is zooming out and challenging the boundaries. It’s also about zooming in, and adding nuance to the sections from last year. It’s more fun if you’ve <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html">read last year’s review first</a>: You can then diff my growth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It all began with a question: How do I grow further?</p>

<h2 id="growing-using-different-ladders-of-abstraction">Growing using different ladders of abstraction</h2>

<p>Entering my second year, I had all the basics in place. I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”</p>

<p>There was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>However, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.</p>

<p>I zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.</p>

<h2 id="learning-what-people-around-me-are-doing">Learning what people around me are doing</h2>

<p>Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Most big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.</p>

<p>Product managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.</p>

<p>Over the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.</p>

<p>For example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.</p>

<!-- More recently, I got a chance to sit in on a few product scoping meetings between teams. This gave me a lot more appreciation for the job my PM and TLs do. Communication is surprisingly hard, and aligning different teams takes skill. -->

<!-- Force multiplier in team vs force multiplier in the entire chain. -->

<h2 id="learning-good-habits-of-mind">Learning good habits of mind</h2>

<p>Software engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.</p>

<p>A habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.</p>

<p>I suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-well">Thinking Well</h3>

<p>Software engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.</p>

<p>I dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life. One output was <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html">a framework for critical thinking</a>. It’s compounding, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">and compounding is powerful</a>.</p>

<p>There’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-for-making-day-to-day-more-effective">Strategies for making day-to-day more effective</h3>

<p>The other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.</p>

<p>You decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.</p>

<p>Some good habits I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action</li>
  <li>Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.</li>
  <li>Document design decisions made during a project</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.</p>



<p>New tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.</p>

<p>I’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdCYUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Driven Design</a><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25">5</a></sup>. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.</p>

<p>The second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#map-and-the-territory">map the territory</a> - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.</p>

<p>The final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J seems interesting</a>, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/vocabulary-mental-model.html">vocabulary is a meta-mental model</a>. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.</p>

<p>When memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.</p>

<p>Broadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-slack">Protect your slack</h2>

<p>When I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.</p>

<p>One thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.</p>

<p>Caveats apply, but here’s what I mean:</p>

<p>I’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Whenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is slack</a>, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.</p>

<p>When there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.</p>

<p>Protecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Slack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.</p>

<p>When I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.</p>

<p>I protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise …</p></div></div>

<p>I try to consolidate my MLSS 2020 notes in small blog posts and hope you might also find them interesting. I don’t try to cover the complete lectures but rather pick some pieces that I find important when working or doing research in ML. I anticipate this series of blog posts will range from extremely superficial to excessively detailed for some readers.</p>

<p>I will start with Bernhard Schölkopf’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmJtThWmhA">lecture</a> on Causality (the second part by Stefan Bauer can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DJWJpn0DmU">here</a>) and draw some connections to Moritz Hardt’s presentations (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq_S_7IfOU">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oNVFQ9llPc">2</a>) on fairness. I also recommend taking a look at Bernhard’s very accessible <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf">monograph</a>.</p>

<h3 id="independence-of-events-and-random-variables">Independence of Events and Random Variables</h3>

<p>Before we start, we define some basic notions. The first one is the statistical <strong>independence of events</strong>. Let’s consider the events “rainy day” $R$ and “choosing Cini Minis as breakfast cereal” $C$ together with their respective probabilities $Pr(\cdot)$. If rain does not influence your cereal choice, and you can’t change the weather by eating Cini Minis, we say the events are <em>independent</em>, and the following equality holds:
$$
Pr(R \cap C) = Pr(R) \cdot Pr(C).
$$
Similarly, we can define the <strong>independence of continuous random variables</strong> $X$ and $Y$. We write
$$
X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y
$$
for independent variables if for their probability density functions $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ it holds that
$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)
$$
for all $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>For the next concept, we introduce a third random variable $Z$ on which we can condition $X$ and $Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ and <strong>conditionally independent</strong> given $Z$, we write
$$
(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y) | Z,
$$
and for the joint probability density conditioned on $Z$, it holds that $f_{XY|Z}(x,y|z)=f_X(x|z)f_Y(y|z)$ for all $x$,$y$, and
$z$ such that $f_Z(z)&gt;0$. This simply translates to the fact that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if I know $Z$, knowing $X$ does not tell me anything additional about $Y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this relevant for causality? The notion of whether or not two random variables are dependent or independent is essential to understand the underlying phenomena that govern this relationship. For example, if we consider the classic example of observing increased stork activity ($X$) and increased birth rate ($Y$), $X$ and $Y$ can depend on each other in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>$X \rightarrow Y$: storks bring babies, or</li>
<li>$Y \rightarrow X$: babies attract storks.</li>
</ol>

<p>If we believe that both causal relationships are nonsensical, there must be a third factor that influences both observations simultaneously, $X$ and $Y$ have a <strong>common cause</strong> $Z$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$.</p>

<p>The fact that there is an underlying mechanism ($Z$) that explains the observed dependence is also known as the <strong>common cause principle</strong> [<a href="#reichenbach_1956">1</a>]. Importantly, we cannot determine which of the three relationships is the “truth” given observational data alone.</p>

<h3 id="structural-causal-model">Structural Causal Model</h3>

<p>One approach to model such relationships/dependencies is <strong>structural causal models (SCM)</strong> [<a href="#pearl_2009">2</a>], realized as directed acyclic graph (DAG) as shown below. <em>Directed</em> because we have arrows in one direction, rather than “simple” edges. <em>Acyclic</em> because there are no self-references. Vertices are <em>observables</em> (see <a href="#ontol_insta">further down</a> for an analysis of the meaning of vertices with respect to fairness in AI), and arrows represent <em>direct causation</em>.
</p><p><img src="https://christian.bock.ml/SCM.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">
</p>

<p><span><i>Figure 1:</i> Example of a structural causal model with noise variable $U$.</span>
</p>

<p>In the above graph, we say that an observable $X$, modeled as a random variable, is a function<sup><a href="#fn_func">1</a></sup> of its parents $PA$ and exogenic or noise variables $U$:
$$
X_j = f_j(PA_j, U_j), \qquad (j=1, \dots, n).
$$</p>

<p>Importantly, all noise variables $U$ are stochastic and <strong>jointly independent</strong>, which leads to the insight that the functional viewpoint $f_j(PA_j, U_j)$ can represent the general conditional distribution $p(X_j|PA_j)$. If the $U$s were not independent, there has to be another mechanism (which we called $Z$ in the stork example) that causes their dependence, and hence we’d have to add it in the diagram. But since this is not the case, the graph contains all potential factors, and we call it <strong>causally sufficient</strong>.</p>

<p>The functional representation of a node can expressed purely by the noise factors by recursively substituting the parent equations:
$$
X_j = f_j(PA_j, U_j) = f_j(f_k(PA_k, U_k), U_j) = f_j(f_k(f_l(PA_l, U_j), U_k), U_j) = \dots = g_j(U_1, \dots, U_n)
$$
Each $X_j$ is therefore a random variable and we get a joint distribution of $p(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ which we call the <em>observational distribution</em>.</p>

<h4 id="disentangled-factorization-graphical-causal-inference">Disentangled Factorization &amp; Graphical Causal Inference</h4>

<p>If a structural causal model (e.g., a graph $G$ as shown in Figure 1) exists, there exists a factorization of the observational distribution:
$$
p(X_1, \dots, X_n) = \prod_ip(X_i, PA_i).
$$
We call each $p(X_i, PA_i)$ a <em>causal conditional</em> or <em>causal Markov kernel</em>. Note that only conditionals that are exclusively conditioned on their parents are <em>causal</em>; they are statistically independent of non-descendants given the parents (this is the <strong>local causal Markov condition</strong>). We call this factorization <strong>disentangled/causal</strong> if 1. knowing a mechanism $p(X_i,PA_i)$ does not yield any information about another mechanism $p(X_j,PA_j)$ for $i \neq j$, and 2. changing one $p(X_i,PA_i)$ does not change $p(X_j,PA_j)$ for $i \neq j$.</p>

<p>Changing $X_j$, for example by setting it to a constant $X_j=const$, is also called <strong>intervention</strong>. Interventions are key operators in Pearl’s <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causal-models/do-calculus.html">do-calculus</a>, which I will not address here, but this blog post should help you understand the concept.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical Causal Inference</strong>
They key question is now: How can we recover the graph $G$ of an SCM from the observational distribution $p$ (a.k.a the data)? The answer sounds quite simple: We perform conditional independence testing by tracking how the noise information “spreads through the data”. To make a statement about the existence of a causal graph $G$ when we only see data, we have to assume that seeing data is enough to actually make a statement about $G$. This sounds tautological but is called <strong>faithfulness</strong> and can be formalized by writing</p>

<p>$$
(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_p \Rightarrow (X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_G.
$$
This means that from <em>observed</em> conditional independence, we can <em>deduce</em> the causal relationship of these variables. This, however, is hard to justify for finite data, and we need to make assumptions on the function classes $f_{\bullet}$ (see chapter 6 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf">Causality for Machine Learning</a> for details).</p>

<p>That’s all I wanted to say about this topic. As I said, it is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully provides the lingo that helps to understand some of the basic concepts of causality.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-ontol-insta-parallel-to-fairness-in-ai-ontological-instability-of-causal-vertices-observables-span"><span id="ontol_insta"> Parallel to Fairness in AI: Ontological instability of causal vertices/observables </span></h3>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=adnTgaAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Moritz Hardt</a> argued that we have to ask the fundamental question of what a node in a causal graph actually references. What is the ontological entity? He motivated this line of thought by considering the situation in which the job application of a person dressed like a hipster was rejected. There are now two positions we can take:</p>

<ol>
<li>He was rejected because he is a hipster (being a hipster caused the rejection), and</li>
<li>He was rejected because he did not meet the dress code (his clothing caused the rejection).</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first position, there is a <strong>mediator</strong> that conveyed that this person is a hipster (e.g., his clothes), which influenced the decision (left graph in Fig. 2). The second view stresses that being assigned the “hipster” label can be influenced by <strong>confounders</strong> such as clothing (right graph in Fig. 2).</p>

<p><img src="https://christian.bock.ml/hipster_SCM.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">
</p>

<p><span><i>Figure 2:</i> Two possible causal graphs generated by two ontological views.</span>
</p>

<p>The problem that clothing can be seen as either a mediator or a confounder, depending on the ontology that fits your world view best, is pointed out by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bAipNH8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Judea Pearl</a> himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you surely know by now, mistaking a mediator for a confounder is one of the deadliest sins in causal inference and may lead to the most outrageous error. The latter invites adjustment; the former forbids it. [<a href="#pearl_2018">4</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bigger question is: why can “hipster” even be a node in the first place? What does it reference, and what are its “settings”?
In a more serious, but analogous situation (“she was rejected because of her religion”) we can take the same two views: Education acts as mediator for religion, and both influence the decision, or education is a confounder that determines religion (see <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/eb/r30.pdf">Fairness in Decision-Making - The Causal Explanation Formula</a>). According to Hardt, these competing models are manifestations of the suppressed question of what the “religion” node references in the first place. A similar problem arises from putting “race” in a causal model: <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190610173.001.0001/oso-9780190610173#:~:text=is%20no%20...-,What%20is%20race%3F,the%20biological%20and%20social%20sciences.">What is race?</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MAJOR</strong>: is incremented when you add breaking changes, e.g. an incompatible API change </li>
<li><strong>MINOR</strong>: is incremented when you add backward compatible functionality</li>
<li><strong>PATCH</strong>: is incremented when you add backward compatible bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conventional Commits</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Conventional Commits specification proposes introducing a standardized lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
This convention dovetails with SemVer, asking software developers to describe in commit messages, features, fixes, and breaking changes that they make.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers tend to write commit messages that <a href="http://whatthecommit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serve no purpose</a>. Usually, the message does not
describe where changes were made, what was changed, and what was the motivation for making the changes. </p>
<p>So I recommend to write commit messages using the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits specification</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;type&gt;[optional scope]: &lt;description&gt;

[optional body]

[optional footer]</code></pre></div>
<p>An example of such a message: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>fix: ABC-123: Caught Promise exception

We did not catch the promise exception thrown by the API call
and therefore we could not show the error message to the user</code></pre></div>
<p>The commit type <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> can take one of these value:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fix:</code> a commit of this type patches a bug in your codebase and correlates with the patch version in semantic versioning</li>
<li><code>feat:</code> a commit of this type introduces a new feature to the codebase and correlates with a minor version in semantic versioning</li>
<li><code>BREAKING CHANGE:</code> a commit that has the text <code>BREAKING CHANGE:</code> at the beginning of its optional body or footer section
introduces a breaking API change and correlates with a major version in semantic versioning. A breaking change can be part of
commits of any type. e.g., a <code>fix:</code>, <code>feat:</code> &amp; <code>chore:</code> types would all be valid, in addition to any other type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types like <code>chore:</code>, <code>docs:</code>, <code>style:</code>, <code>refactor:</code>, <code>perf:</code>, <code>test:</code> are recommended by the
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular convention</a>. These
types have no implicit effect on semantic versioning and are not part of the conventional commit specification.</p>
<p>I also recommend reading <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Write Good Commit Messages: A Practical Git Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Auto-Generate Changelog</h2>
<p>Now we can start to automate the changelog creation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://conventionalcommits.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits Specification</a> in your repository. We will use <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@commitlint/config-conventional</a> to enforce this via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git hooks</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard-version</a>, a utility for versioning using SemVer and changelog generation powered by <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will demonstrate the usage based on this <a href="https://github.com/Mokkapps/changelog-generator-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo project</a> which
was initialized running <code>npm init</code> and <code>git init</code>.</p>
<p>The next step is to install <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">husky</a>, which sets up your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git hooks</a>:</p>

<p>Then install <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitlint</a> with a config, which will be used to lint your commit message:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}</code></pre></div>
<p>As we are using <code>config-conventional</code> we are automatically following the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular commit convention</a>.</p>
<p>Now we need to tell Husky to run <code>commitlint</code> during the Git commit hook. We can add it to the <code>package.json</code> </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"@commitlint/cli"</span><span>:</span> <span>"latest"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"@commitlint/config-conventional"</span><span>:</span> <span>"latest"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"husky"</span><span>:</span> <span>"latest"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"husky"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"hooks"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"commit-msg"</span><span>:</span> <span>"commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>alternatively to a <code>.huskyrc</code> file: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{
  "hooks": {
    "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, we create a <code>.commitlintrc.json</code> file which extends the rules from <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">config-conventional</a>:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"extends"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"@commitlint/config-conventional"</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running <code>git commit</code> with an invalid message will now cause an error:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>▶ git commit -m "this commit message is invalid"
husky &gt; commit-msg (node v14.8.0)
⧗   input: this commit message is invalid
✖   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
✖   type may not be empty [type-empty]

✖   found 2 problems, 0 warnings
ⓘ   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint

husky &gt; commit-msg hook failed (add --no-verify to bypass)</code></pre></div>
<p>and valid commits will work: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>▶ git commit -m "feat: initial feature commit"
[master (root-commit) a87f2ea] feat: initial feature commit
 5 files changed, 1228 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .commitlintrc.json
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 index.js
 create mode 100644 package-lock.json
 create mode 100644 package.json</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we are safe and can guarantee that only valid commit messages are in our repository. </p>
<h2>Generate Changelog</h2>
<p>Finally, we can create our changelog from our Git history. First step is to install <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard-version</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm i --save-dev standard-version</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can create some npm scripts in our <code>package.json</code>: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"release"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"release:minor"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version --release-as minor"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"release:patch"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version --release-as patch"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"release:major"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version --release-as major"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The changelog generation can be configured via a <code>.versionrc.json</code> file or placing a <code>standard-version</code> stanza in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>In our demo we use a <code>.versionrc.json</code> file based on the <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec/blob/master/versions/2.1.0/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Changelog Configuration Spec</a>: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"types"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"feat"</span><span>,</span> <span>"section"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Features"</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"fix"</span><span>,</span> <span>"section"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Bug Fixes"</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"chore"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"docs"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"style"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"refactor"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"perf"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"test"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span>
    <span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"commitUrlFormat"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://github.com/mokkapps/changelog-generator-demo/commits/{{hash}}"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"compareUrlFormat"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://github.com/mokkapps/changelog-generator-demo/compare/{{previousTag}}...{{currentTag}}"</span>
  <span>}</span>
  </code></pre></div>
<p>An array of <code>type</code> objects represents the explicitly supported commit message types, and whether they should show up in the generated changelog file.
<code>commitUrlFormat</code> is an URL representing a specific commit at a hash and <code>compareUrlFormat</code> is an URL representing the comparison between two git shas.</p>
<p>The first release can be created by running <code>npm run release -- --first-release</code> in the terminal:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>▶ npm run release -- --first-release

&gt; changelog-generator-demo@0.0.0 release /Users/mhoffman/workspace/changelog-generator-demo
&gt; standard-version "--first-release"

✖ skip version bump on first release
✔ created CHANGELOG.md
✔ outputting changes to CHANGELOG.md
✔ committing CHANGELOG.md
✔ tagging release v0.0.0
ℹ Run `git push --follow-tags origin master` to publish</code></pre></div>
<p>An exemplary <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> could look similar to this one:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>What I like is that the changelog is divided by the type of commit, it contains links to the specific commits and link to
the diff of the version.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always edit the auto-generated changelog to make it more readable though. The generated changelog Markdown
text can be pasted into GitHub releases so that it shows up next to each release tag. There are a lot more options in
the tools to customize linting commits or the changelog generation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For lazy developers like me, an automatic changelog generation is a nice tool that saves me a lot of time. Additionally,
we have better commit messages in our code repository as they follow an established specification. </p>
<p>It needs some time to get used to the commit convention. You could encounter some discussions in your team as all
code contributors need to follow the convention. The Git hook solution should catch the wrong messages as early as possible
but you could also add a guard in your CI/CD pipeline. </p>
<p>In my opinion, it is worth the effort to introduce the Git commit convention and the changelog generation in projects.
We as developers do not need to invest much time &amp; brain capacity for the changelog generation and have a helpful
document where we can look up what has changed between our software releases. Additionally, we can easily share this
with the users of our software so that they also see what they can expect from each new release.</p></div></div>]]>

	<section>
		<p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post was triggered/inspired by an article you can find <a href="https://thehftguy.com/2020/08/26/technical-debt-doesnt-exist/">here</a>. I strongly encourage you to get familiar with it - whatever I put below is built on it as a foundation, so all the kudos go to <strong>The HFT Guy</strong>.</em></p><hr><p>Mental models are extremely powerful thought constructs. They do guide &amp; simplify our reasoning, but they also prime us. Bias us. And when treated as axioms, dangerously narrow down our thinking horizons.</p><p>All of the above applies to the popular concept of <strong>"technical debt" (TD)</strong>. I won't cover its meaning and history (there are tons of online materials on those) - instead, I'd like to focus on why the concept of TD is far less useful than we tend to think and actually quite harmful for our daily work.</p><p>Why so? Mainly because:</p><ol><li>there's no code w/o technical debt - TD is <strong>a "local" maintainability factor</strong> (a multiplier - that can span from very low to extremely high values) for a particular piece of a system; hence it's not separable from good (/healthy) code; consider it an inevitable "property" of any code</li><li>mentally dividing work between "fixing/fighting TD" and "developing features" usually leads to: never doing anything about TD and just going short-cuts all the time (<em>"I'll just do it the quick'n'dirty style, we'll need to refactor all that anyway ... some day"</em>)</li><li>we tend to brand as TD <strong>everything "we don't like at the moment"</strong> (a code written by someone else, a code that uses a library we find passé atm, etc.) - which leads to several types of immature &amp; unprofessional practices and massive wastes ("lava flow" effect, stacking unnecessary abstractions, etc.)</li><li>for the reasons stated above, TD is highly subjective and prone to individual judgment, hence nearly impossible to reliably quantify &amp; measure (regardless of whether you estimate the cost of its reduction or its actual impact on the development process); but it looks like <strong>a great candidate for a universal excuse</strong> (and it's frequently used that way)</li><li>it conveniently puts engineers in "we VS the debt" mode by giving the common enemy (that won't speak up) - some ephemeral "entity" you can stand in opposition to; this detail is important: no-one ever openly admits to the ownership over the TD, it just pops up out of the thin air and hinders the work of poor engineers ...</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, peeling TD out of its name won't make all its negative consequences disappear, right? Naming it explicitly at least makes discussing it (among engineers) easier &amp; (hopefully) more conclusive.</p><p>But maybe there's a better way to tame it? E.g. by ...</p><ul><li>... treating it as something inevitable (as there's no and there'll never be perfect, debt-less code)</li><li>... containing it within component/element/unit boundaries</li><li>... and coming up with a way to "reset" it (once in a while) within those local boundaries?</li></ul><p>I've already written (over four years ago) about some particular concept that can help with that - <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/wiping-the-tech-debt-out-with-immutable-code/"><strong>the immutable code</strong></a>. It may sound weird at first glance, but apparently many companies adopt a similar standpoint:</p><ul><li>they create software with the EXPIRY date (on the level of module/component/piece) and re-create it every few years (because business/scale conditions do change anyway) - as a normal business-as-usual activity</li><li>they optimize not for "perfect architectures" but for future re-writes on the level of module/component/piece (e.g. by enforcing explicit contracts - so after a single component replacement, the whole system doesn't collapse like a house of cards)</li></ul><p>That's (creating with a re-write in mind) actually something I've already covered in <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/are-the-software-product-companies-doomed-to-collapse/"><strong>the different post in the past</strong></a>, so feel free to reach there for more details.</p><p>Great! But what if my system wasn't written in a re-write-friendly way? What if there are no explicit contracts, dependencies are out of control, the only units of abstractions are the language's syntactic constructs (a flat list, w/o hierarchy or varying perspectives) and it's not possible to map certain capabilities/duties?</p><p>HA! And now we've reached a conclusion I was looking for - the main pre-requisite to build a future-proof solution with a TAMEABLE technical debt is ... <strong>by doing a deliberate design</strong>. It can be done up-front or in an evolutionary way - the mode doesn't matter that much. The truly crucial elements are:</p><ul><li>capability-driven composition (driven by purpose, function) with explicit boundaries and dependencies</li><li>the ubiquitous language used everywhere</li><li>wide (expressive) but shallow (w/o internal details) contracts treated as a binding promise to all the consumers</li></ul><p>That's also why so many attempts to reduce technical debt by purely technical refactoring (e.g. splitting big classes, harmonizing conventions, simplifying the flow in complicated procedures) are a pure waste w/o any noticeable positive long-term effect.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>After writing &amp; publishing articles for about two years (consistently), Iâ€™ve sort of created a system when it comes to publishing an article. From ideation to hitting the publish button.</p>

<p>Of course, this system is ever-evolving and over the years, Iâ€™ve tried to tweak it to suit my needs. And today, I think it has reached to a point where I can share it with you and allow you to peek into this very â€œsystemâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, when I started this blog, I was used to writing casually and back then i.e. I was only used to post articles whenever I feel like. But from the previous two years, things have changed. Iâ€™ve started to take it more seriously and started publishing articles quite frequently. Almost daily (of course, with a few exceptions).</p>

<p>You might be asking how Iâ€™ve started writing so much? And where do I get ideas from?</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is <strong><em>â€œFrom teaching things to myselfâ€�</em></strong>. In a nutshell, whenever Iâ€™m in a situation where I donâ€™t get certain concepts correctly, I would first try to understand the topic thoroughly. And when things get clear for me, I would try to depict the concept in my words. In a way that can make me understand whenever I look upon it next time.</p>

<p>That means I primarily write articles for myself only. And if anyone gets benefitted from my articles, it would be an added bonus!</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-article">Writing the Article</h2>

<p>Next, for writing articles, Iâ€™m using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> because articles are written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and nothing is better than the VS Codeâ€™s built-in support for Markdown in my opinion. To get started with a brand new article, all I need to do is whip up a blank Markdown file and pour my heart out in it. Itâ€™s as simple as that.</p>

<p>To make this even better, I use a VS Code extension called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> which add some essential things such as keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview, and more when it comes to Markdown. It saves tonnes of time fiddling around some Markdown quirks.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-article">Fixing the Article</h2>

<p>Once the article has been written, I head to <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">grammarly.com</a> and paste in my entire article to check for spelling and grammatical mistakes. And once it detects those errors, it can fix those in a cinch.</p>

<p>On top of this, it also suggests alternative words and removal of unnecessary words which can make the entire reading experience a pleasant one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back then, I was not very concerned regarding making my articles grammar-correct. But over time, I realised itâ€™s important from the perspective of a reader because Iâ€™m also an avid reader myself. And so the grammar correction step entered into my workflow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now is the time to create a nice social banner for the article. It looks something like so on Twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/social-banner-demo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of content creators ignore this but in my opinion, it is a really important thing if youâ€™re posting your articles across different social media platforms. It can make your article stand out because images can grab usersâ€™ attention more quickly than the text.</p>

<p>I use a service called <a href="https://crello.com/">Crello</a> where I create social banners every time I write a new article. The banner contains nothing but the title of the article but alas! in big and attention-grabbing fonts. Itâ€™s all handmade.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-the-article">Publishing the Article</h2>

<p>At this moment, everything is in the place and the article is ready to be published. For publishing the article, all it takes is a simple <code>git push</code> in my case as Iâ€™ve hosted my blog on GitHub Pages and it triggers the new build on every Git push.</p>

<p>Once the code is pushed, it would take 30-45 seconds to make the article live on the holy internet!</p>

<p>And that completes my entire workflow from <em>ideation</em> to <em>publishing an article</em>. Iâ€™ve been following this workflow from the past two years and it has suited me very well and Iâ€™m hoping the continue it for some more time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><span>The creator of </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-Component-Storage-System/" rel="nofollow">this project</a><span>, APTechnologies, came up with the idea for the storage cabinet by observing that he would run into trouble when organizing his component library. Rather than having to go across the workshop to get each part, he wanted a way to consolidate everything into one place for easy finding. The system works by first having the user search for a part on an adjacent screen, and then the associated bin will light up if the component is found in the system.</span></p><h3 id="toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><a href="#toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><i></i></a><span>Designing the Cabinet</span></h3><p>The storage solution is comprised of a 35 x 12 grid of drawers, which gives ample space for parts. The drawers are laid out according to the spacing between the LEDs in the strip (30 LEDs/meter). They are meant to be printed individually and then slotted in, plus they come in several different sizes.</p><h3 id="toc-fabrication-1"><a href="#toc-fabrication-1"><i></i></a><span>Fabrication</span></h3><p>Each drawer was 3D-printed on a Prusa Mk2S with PLA filament at a .2mm layer height. In order to minimize filament consumption, wall thicknesses are kept very thin, but even with this savings, 5kg of filament was required to fabricate the parts. There is also a small articulating arm that juts out from the side for the HDMI display.</p><h3 id="toc-software-2"><a href="#toc-software-2"><i></i></a><span>Software</span></h3><p>The primary way to interact with the system is through the terminal, which runs a Python 3 script. It begins by checking the text file for data integrity, where it then gets parsed and loaded into an object. Data is stored in CSV-style fashion, with the ID being the first column, the associated LEDs in the second, and finally the quantity in the third column. All subsequent values are optional and simply loaded by the user when the parts is located. A regex is used to parse the user's request, including searching for a component, changing its quantity, adding a new part, and removing a component.</p><h3 id="toc-electronics-3"><a href="#toc-electronics-3"><i></i></a><span>Electronics</span></h3><p>According to the project's creator, the choice for hardware components was quite straightforward. He used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in conjunction with a generic HDMI monitor to show the command line interface. For power delivery, he opted for a simple 5V adapter to power both the Raspberry Pi 4 and NeoPixel strip. Since the Pi outputs 3.3v signals from its GPIO pins, a level-shifter is needed, in this case a 74AHCT125. There is an option to use an Arduino Uno via UART if the NeoPixel strip is too unreliable, since the Arduino Uno can supply stricter timings.</p><h3 id="toc-usage-4"><a href="#toc-usage-4"><i></i></a><span>Usage</span></h3><p><span>To add a new part, the command </span><code>PI&lt;ledn&gt;:PI&lt;ledn+k&gt;, &lt;quantity&gt;[, optional parameters]:add</code><span> is sent, which adds a new component to the library. Other commands such as ID&lt;id number&gt; (search for part by ID) and ID&lt;id number&gt;:rm (remove part with that ID) exist to manage added components in the library.</span></p><h3 id="toc-possible-additions-5"><a href="#toc-possible-additions-5"><i></i></a><span>Possible Additions</span></h3><p>Although the system works well for one place and a small collection of components, it tends to scale poorly when there's a large library or multiple users want to interact with it. One way to solve this issue is to replace the single text file with a relational database such as MySQL, where parts can be stored and indexed in a single table, and other data can be referenced. This gives a very powerful interface for the software to easily search, add, and modify parts without having to read and rewrite the text file constantly.</p></div></section><section></section><div><div><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236">Arduino “having11” Guy</a><span></span></span></p><p>18 year-old IoT and embedded systems enthusiast.

<p>There is a huge gap between the benefits of Artificial Intelligence the public is being sold, the benefits of AI which are being marketed to corporate adopters, and the actual motivations of AI researchers.</p>



<ul><li>Tech providers pitch AI as a driver of innovation (self-driving cars) and global good (mitigating global warming).&nbsp; But the B2B case-studies pitched to corporate clients more often pitch AI solutions as <em>better automation, </em>mostly enabling cost-reduction (specifically, reducing human-in-the-loop labor).</li><li>While many AI researchers are motivated by genuine interest in improving the human condition, other motivations diverge — a desire to push the bounds of what we <em>can </em>do, a genuine belief in transhumanism (the desire for AI to replace, or transform into something entirely unrecognizable, humanity), or simply because AI pays bigly.</li></ul>



<p>These drivers — replacing human employment, and perhaps humans themselves — are, to put it mildly — not visions the public has bought into.</p>



<p>But these internal motivations are drowned out by the marketing AI pitch by which AI is sold to the public: “AI will solve [hunger/the environment/war/global warming]”.&nbsp; This leaves the people not “in the know” about AI progress — 99% of the population — not even <em>thinking </em>to use democracy to direct AI research towards a world the (average) person actually wants to live in.</p>



<p>This is not particularly fair.</p>



<p><strong>Marketed AI vs Profitable AI</strong></p>



<p>To the public, the tech giants selling AI solutions (Google, Microsoft, and Apple) pitch visions of AI <em>for good</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public face of these advertising campaigns is usually brand advertising, perhaps pitching consumers on a software ecosystem (Android, iOS), but rarely selling any specific product.&nbsp; This makes it easy to sell the public a <em>vision </em>of the future in HDR, backed by inspirational hipster soundtracks.</p>



<p>You all know what I’m talking about — you’ve seen them on TV and in movie theaters — but the imagery is so<em> honed, </em>so <em>heroic, </em>that we should look at the pictures anyway.</p>



<p>Google’s AI will do revolutionary things, like fix farming, improve birthday parties, and help us not walk off cliffs:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jId-kNaiaBP0HNR6FjXXaS3HPKHoVr_tLUjEjjGS5sZ23IF1718IWzLeD719RSqO2Aj6vx3oDgeedE_Yjg5xcdNzl2IC71KP79uS0gUjyHSMEkLI1VALL8iqmwdhWXxTdGN7Qm2j" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s AI is safe.&nbsp; You can tell because this man is looking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5">very thoughtfully</a> into the distance:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JKMsdtPMVmd5PHVOAgCleWpG4WctVm-3rGxiM70Tg0HsmDgdxYysjqjGR_zn0I8SEs-lLQxpOyKqxFI_RioIuGDGUFMillFX4T7IxZPI6jHpNiQ10YWpCoodiWli-Z8IxlRVFxq4" alt=""></figure>



<p>But if that is not enough to convince you, here is a bird:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_NtL_Yy86NCoL4J_2kOpzAObYf9KTQ2D0i98JV4PnuAAE-yCqqAOXv7NGB_BSL8KJ-zBLGuiuqI5-fqmFkXLDVIONHPvvUWY6XWzjKC6D0LRaIVXjixdCWaidceDERUBRz-OyjP0" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft goes into detail on their “AI for Good” page.&nbsp; The testimonials highlight the power of AI as applied to:</p>



<ul><li>Environmental sustainability (image recognition of land use, wildlife tracking, maximizing farm yields)</li><li>Healthcare (dredging through data to find diseases)</li><li>Accessibility (machine translation, text to speech)</li><li>Humanitarian action and Cultural Heritage preservation</li></ul>



<p>Even the Chinese search engine Baidu, not exactly known for their humanitarian work, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/baidu-becomes-first-chinese-firm-to-join-us-safe-a-i-consortium/">has joined</a> the OpenAI “safe AI” consortium, which is nominally dedicated to developing and selling only <em>safe </em>AI.</p>



<p>The theme among all these public “good AI” initiatives — the sales pitch to the public — is:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re developing advanced AI, but we’re partnering with NGOs, hospitals, and more, to make this AI work <em>for </em>people, not against them.&nbsp; Look at all the good we can do!”</p></blockquote>



<p>This isn’t fake.&nbsp; Microsoft <em>is </em>working with nonprofits, NGOs, and more, to deploy for-the-people AI.&nbsp; But these applications don’t get us closer to the <em>real </em>question:</p>



<p>“What solutions are <em>normal</em> companies <em>actually deploying </em>with AI-as-a-service cloud technology?”</p>



<p>We can peek behind the curtain at Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon’s AWS has been for the last decade synonymous with “the cloud”, and still has a full 50% market share.&nbsp; The bleeding edge of AWS are plug-and-play machine learning and AI tools: Amazon Forecast (machine learning), Amazon Polly (text to speech), Amazon Rekognition (video object recognition), Amazon Comprehend (natural language processing), and more.</p>



<p>And Amazon, alone and refreshingly among tech giants, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3463071/aws-is-ethical-about-ai-but-we-just-don-t-talk-about-it-say-apac-execs.html">doesn’t even pretend</a> to care why their customers use AI:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We certainly don’t want to do evil; everything we’ve released to customers to innovate [helps] to lift the bar on what’s actually happening in the industry. It’s really up to the individual organisation how they use that tech”</p></blockquote>



<p>Amazon sells AI to C-suites, and we know what the hooks are, because the marketing pitches are online.&nbsp; AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/customers/?customer-references-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.publishedDate&amp;customer-references-cards.sort-order=desc&amp;awsf.customer-references-category=category%23ai-ml&amp;awsm.page-customer-references-cards=2">publishes case studies</a> about how their plug-and-play AI and ML solutions are used by customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can look at a typical example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/dxc/?did=cr_card&amp;trk=cr_card">here</a>, outlining how DXC used AWS’s ML and AI toolkits to improve customer service call center interactions.&nbsp; Fair warning:&nbsp; the full read is catastrophically boring — which is to be expected when AI used not to expand the horizon of what is possible… but instead used to excise human labor from work which is already being done:</p>



<blockquote><p>“DXC has also reduced the lead time to edit and change call flow messaging on its IVR system. With its previous technology, it took two months to make changes to IVR scripts because DXC had to retain a professional voice-over actor and employ a specialized engineer to upload any change. With Amazon Polly, it only takes hours”</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Using Amazon Connect, DXC has been able to automate password resets, so the number of calls that get transferred to an agent has dropped by 30–60 percent.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>DXC anticipates an internal cost reduction of 30–40 percent as a result of implementing Amazon Connect, thanks to increased automation and improved productivity on each call.</p></blockquote>



<p>In total, what did DXC do with its deployed AI solution?&nbsp; AI is being used to:</p>



<ul><li>Replace a voice-over actor</li><li>Eliminate an operations engineer</li><li>Eliminate customer service agents</li></ul>



<p>There’s nothing evil in streamlining operations.&nbsp; But because of the split messaging being used to <em>sell </em>AI research to the public vs to industry — on one hand, visions of environmental sustainability and medical breakthroughs, and on the other hand, the mundane breakthrough of applying a scalpel to a call center’s staffing — the public has little insight (other than nagging discomfort) into automation end-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complete lack of (organized) public anger or federal AI policy — or even an <em>attempt </em>at a policy — speaks to the success of this doublespeak.</p>



<p><strong>Research motivations</strong></p>



<p>So why are actual engineers and researchers <em>building </em>AI solutions?</p>



<p>I could dredge forums and form theories, but I decided to just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/gz5so7/why_are_you_personally_working_on_ai/">ask on reddit</a>, in a quick and completely unscientific test.&nbsp; Feel free to read all the responses — I’ve tried to aggregate them here and distill them into the four main themes.&nbsp; Weighted by upvotes, here’s the summary:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DvF1XOwrQOuSnpwX0z5y1YLq3keBLTdqSQqyOKj1FrdmNANo2gVWZXWjHnp282aio1EzBBfWMYNPfof4MKZDdeJoQKe18Znbw0jI-iI2QxmmeVkF-MTWGGOsnF1xAaSlMUCtiilV" alt=""></figure>



<p>Preface: none of these are radical new revelations.&nbsp; They match, in degrees, what you’d find with a more exhaustive dragnet of public statements, blogs, or after liquoring up the academic research mainstream.</p>



<p>Walking down the list:</p>



<p><strong>1. Improving the human condition</strong></p>



<p>A plurality goal is to better the human condition, which is promising.&nbsp; An archetypal response is a vision of a future without work (or at least, without universal work):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I believe the fundamental problem of the human race is that pretty much everyone has to work for us to survive.</p><p>So I want to work on fixing that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not a vision without controversy — it’s an open question whether people can really live fulfilled lives in a world where they <em>aren’t</em> <em>really needed —</em> but at minimum it’s a vision many could get behind, and is at root predicated in a goal of human dignity.</p>



<p><strong>2. It pays</strong></p>



<p>Close behind are crude economics.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p> “Dat money”</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t intend to sound negative — capitalism is the lever which moves the world, and in capitalism, money follows value.&nbsp; But as shown by AWS, value can come from either revolutionary invention (delivering novel value), or cost excision (delivering <em>cheaper </em>value).</p>



<p>Either direction pays the bills (and engineers), and few megacorp engineers care to peek behind the curtain at which specific aspect of the AI product delivered to clients pays the bills.</p>



<p><strong>3. Transhumanism</strong></p>



<p>Here’s where the interests of true believers in AI diverge from the mainstream.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t really care about modern ML solutions, I am only concerned with AGI. Once we understand the mechanisms behind our own intelligence, we move to the next phase in our species’ evolution. It’s the next paradigm shift. Working on anything else wouldn’t be worth it since the amount of value it brings is so vast.”</p></blockquote>



<p>“I’m in it for the money” is just realism.&nbsp; “A world without work” and “making cheddar” are motivations which appeal to the mainstream, and is at least comprehensible (if frustrating) to those whose jobs are on the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> is different.&nbsp; There’s a prevalent (although possibly not majority) philosophy among many AI researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts, that the goal of developing strong (human-level) AI is not a tool <em>for </em>humans, but an end unto itself.&nbsp; The goal is the creation of a grander intelligence beyond our own:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Or, step-by-step:</p>



<ul><li>Humans create AI 1.0 with IQ human + 1</li><li>AI 1.0 creates AI 2.0, which is slightly smarter</li><li>AI 2.0 creates AI 3.0, which is WAY smarter</li><li>AI 3.0 creates AI 4.0, which is incomprehensibly smarter</li></ul>



<p>And whatever comes next… we can’t predict.</p>



<p>This is not a complete summary of transhumanism.&nbsp; There’s a spectrum of goals, and widespread desire for AI which can integrate <em>with</em> humans — think, nanobots in the brain, neural augmentation, or wholesale digital brain uploads.&nbsp; But either way — whether the goal is to retrofit or replace …</p></div></div>

<p>Tax efficient investing means carefully choosing certain investments and determining which accounts to hold them in to reduce to reduce your overall tax bill.  Saving money on taxes allows you to make larger investments and keep more of the returns.

<p>Which investments you hold and how you hold them can have a tremendous impact on your long term returns.  The power of compounding can turn small differences now into large differences when you are older.  There are essentially two concepts to keep in mind here, and they are somewhat related.</p>



<ol><li>Some <em>investments</em> are more tax efficient than others</li><li>Some <em>accounts</em> are more tax friendly than others</li></ol>



<p>Your goal should be to hold your least efficient investments in your most tax efficient accounts.  As an example, you can do short term trading inside of a Roth IRA and totally avoid short term capital gains tax!</p>



<h2>What Makes an Investment Tax Efficient?</h2>



<p>Now that you know that some investments are more tax efficient than others let us look at what makes an investment tax efficient.  Investments that generate capital gains and dividends during the year will be generating a tax liability for you in addition to the income.  The more income that the investment generates the higher the tax liability.  </p>



<p>Alternatively, growth investments will not generate any income until you sell them.  This can allow you flexibility for when to earn the income, thus giving you control over when you pay the tax and how much tax you end up paying.  How long you hold an investment matters.  In general, if you hold an investment for over a year you get a reduced tax bill when you sell it.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at how investments generate income and as a result income tax.</p>



<h3>How Do Investments Generate Tax Liability</h3>



<p>Investments can generate taxable income in several ways.  In general, if you sell an investment for more than you paid for it this is called a capital gain.  You will need to pay tax on the capital gain. Also, any cash flows generated from the investment while you own it are taxable income.</p>



<h4>Types of Investment Income</h4>



<ol><li><strong>Capital Gains </strong>– A capital gain is income you generate when you sell an investment for more than you paid for it.  It is defined as <em>sale price – purchase price = capital gain</em>.  Real estate and certain other assets can be more difficult calculate because deprecation of the original purchase price is allowed.  Investments held for more than 1 year before being sold are taxed as long-term gains and have a top federal rate of 23.8% (versus 40.8% for short-term).   This means you should always hold investments you intend to sell within a year in a tax advantaged account.</li><li><strong>Dividends, Interest and Rent</strong> – These are cash payments that are made you for owning the asset.  Stocks can pay dividends, bonds can pay interest, and real estate can pay you rent.  Dividends that are paid on a stock are taxed at the same rate that the capital gains would be on that stock.  This means that for the first year, you would be responsible for short term rate on the dividends.</li></ol>



<p>This is an important concept for stocks.  Growth stocks pay very little dividends but have a high appreciation rate. Dividend stocks have a more stable rate of appreciation but pay frequent dividends.  This means dividend stocks are more appropriately held in tax advantaged accounts and growth stocks that you intend to hold for more than a year can be held in a taxable account.</p>



<h3>Examples of Investments</h3>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Investment</th><th>Tax Efficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Growth Stocks</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend Stocks</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Index ETFs</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>REITs</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Actively Managed Mutual Funds</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Municipal Bonds</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Securities Held Short Term(&lt; 1 year)</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Crypto</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Examples of Investments</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What are Tax Efficient Accounts?</h2>

<p>Uncle Sam gives you multiple options to hold investments in accounts where you won’t generate any tax liability at all.   The most commons ones are IRAs, 401Ks, Health Savings Accounts and Roth IRAs.  <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/top-9-tax-advantaged-accounts/">Here</a> is a complete list of the tax advantaged accounts available to you.  </p>



<p>Only use a taxable account once you have maxed out your other areas of savings.  Only highly efficient investments should be held in a taxable account.  You will have to pay tax on your gains and dividends here, so you should hold your most efficient investments here.</p>



<h3>Should I Hold Tax Inefficient Investments at All?</h3>



<p>You only have so much money to invest and you should be concerned with the <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a> of your investment choices.  This may make you wonder why you would even invest in a tax inefficient choice to begin with.  </p>



<p>You should not rule out tax inefficient investments, you should just be careful where you hold them.  Many tax inefficient investments can have a good risk adjusted return provided you can mitigate the tax liability inherent with holding them.  Ultimately this will help you with diversification of your investments.  </p>



<h3>Take Advantage of as Many Tax Strategies as Possible</h3>



<p>A rational person should seek to pay the least amount of tax and generate the highest returns on their investments.  You should take advantage of every available way of avoiding taxes that you can.  The implications in any single tax year may not be dramatic, but over the course of your lifetime the power of compounding can turn that reduced tax bill into a fortune.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Tax efficiency should not be your primary concern when choosing an investment, but it should be considered.  Don’t eliminate an investment from consideration just because it has a low tax efficiency, but do hold it in a tax efficient account.  Pay attention to the period of time you expect to hold an investment.  Short term capital gains tax can be avoided completely if you hold the stock in a Roth IRA for example.</p>



<p>Ultimately reducing your tax burden will allow you to keep more money invested and due to the power of compounding it can have a dramatic impact on your long term returns.</p>

<p>It was a warm spring evening in London and David Graeber, an anthropology professor at the LSE, was sitting on a rooftop. Our conversation was transmitted through the Internet because of the global travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, we did not only talk about the new virus and its consequences for society, politics, and the economy. We took the rare opportunity to discuss most of his published works – from the <em>Fragments of Anarchist Anthropology</em> and <em>Debt</em> to <em>Utopia of Rule</em>s, and his most recent book <em>The Bullshit Jobs</em>. All of which have become even more relevant during the corona-crisis.</p>



<p>Professor Graeber presents himself as an anthropologist and anarchist. However, he will not be happy if you refer to him as an “anarchist anthropologist” because there is no such discipline, which he explained during the conversation. The professor is also an activist. He joined many social movements and protests in the last few decades and is often credited as the author of the unofficial slogan from the Occupy Wall Street movement: We are the 99 percent. But he insists that the slogan – as well as everything else in the movement – was a collective effort.</p>



<p>How can democratic governments use this health crisis to enforce authoritarian measures on their citizens? Why don’t the health and care workers strike, during the pandemic, for higher wages? What would happen if we closed Wall Street for a few months? Why do we only see flying cars as special effects in science fiction movies? How can anarchistic principles bring order into chaos during the crisis? Why do we not want to depend on the Chinese and US armies to save our planet?</p>



<p>And finally – how can a drunken rant become a best-selling book?</p>

<p><strong>Everybody seems to be speaking the same language during the coronavirus pandemic – from progressive and conservative governments to ISIS and the anarchists: stay at home, wash your hands, avoid other people … And people have been listening to the officials without much protest. They stayed at home and accepted the new rules. We have not seen anything like this for a long while. What has happened?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there are just not all that many people who are quite crazy enough to ignore medical advice during a pandemic.</p>



<p>It brings to mind the 19<sup>th</sup> century French political thinker Henry Saint-Simon—who might have been the first person to come up with the notion of withering away of the state. He argued that if the state was refounded on scientific basis, eventually it would not need to rely on coercion, and therefore, it wouldn’t even be a state in the contemporary sense of having a monopoly of violence.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>



<p>For the same reason, he said, that doctor doesn’t have to threaten to beat you up to convince you to the medicine they prescribe. You know the doctor knows something you don’t know, and you assume the doctor is acting in your best interest. Saint-Simon argued once the state was rationally founded on scientific principles, citizens would act in the same way, and coercive enforcement would become unnecessary. Maybe they’d be a few nutty people who refuse to take their medicine but not enough to make much difference.</p>



<p>Obviously this was all very optimistic and naive—that’s why Marx dismissed people like Saint Simon as “utopian socialists”. But there are certain branches of the government that still claim to operate on such basis. And one could make the argument that they’re not by their nature part of government at all.</p>



<p>During the student movement in the UK in 2010 we talked about this a lot, we were mostly anarchists, but we believed in a public health system, and a public university system. Was this hypocritical? None of us felt it was, but we talked a lot about why. Perhaps the problem is that states don’t allow the existence of public institutions – that is, ones which are both universal and non-profit-oriented – that they don’t control. That doesn’t mean those institutions are somehow of the same nature as the army, or prison system, which are entirely creatures of the state.</p>



<blockquote><p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Yes and of course Foucault would say the authority that does not need a violent force to enforce itself is the scariest kind of all.</strong></p>



<p>He would. Though I think Foucault is often misinterpreted in this regard, to assume that any truth discourse is a form of power, and every form of power is violent and objectionable in itself. True, he sometimes sounds as if that’s what he’s saying. But if specifically challenged, he’d always say, no, no, obviously not.</p>



<p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much. Foucault himself had his own immediate concerns – he was diagnosed as a homosexual in his youth, and wanted to understand how it came about that his most intimate desires could be considered a disease.</p>



<p>He effectively dedicated his life to trying to understand that. But many on the academic left forget that, such diagnoses were not just abstractions, they ultimately relied on force of law, on the threat of physical violence, even if the doctor isn’t personally carrying a gun. A kind of vulgar Foucauldianismn has encouraged us to overlook how much the threat of force really does still lurk behind most of the institutions he describes.</p>



<p>The Panopticon was a prison after all. Normally if you think someone might be staring at you at any moment, you just go someplace else. Actually things have gotten rather worse in that respect since Foucault’s time. There didn’t used to be actual armed guards in schools and hospitals; now in many places there are.</p>



<p><strong>Many governments all over the world are using public health to enforce measures that could not have been imaginable in democratic societies only a few months ago. In Slovenia, for example, individuals are fined when they try to protest against the government actions. Not for protesting, of course. That would be undemocratic. But for violating the law on infectious diseases. So the only groups of people that are allowed move freely are the police, the army, and the politicians.</strong></p>



<p>That does not surprise me. You can learn a lot of things about your state by comparing how they treat a political assembly, and any other kind.</p>



<p><strong>In what way?</strong></p>



<p>In liberal democracies, the entire justification for a country’s legal structure is, typically, some kind of ideal of human freedom and liberty. The American bill of rights begins with the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly. In practice, the assembly of people that gather in order to protest – which is the very essence of what is supposed to be American – is considered <em>less</em> legitimate than an assembly of people who want to sell you something.</p>



<p>You point this out to most middle-class Americans, they seem incredulous. Poor ones not so much, they don’t assume the rules are fair. Anyway: they’ll say “but of course you have the right to assemble, you just need a permit, what’s wrong with that?” So you have to say “all right, if you have to ask police permission to print something, that’s called not having freedom of the press. If you have to ask police permission to say something..” And they’ll say, “but that’s different! There are traffic issues. You can’t just gather. It gets in the way of people walking down the street” Which is funny, because I don’t remember anywhere in the constitution it says anything about the right to unimpeded traffic flow.</p>



<p>We learned that lesson during the Occupy movement. It was startling, after they evicted our camp, how many middle class Americans just shrugged their shoulders when they went on to rip up the Bill of Rights, the very thing they teach their children to be so proud of…</p>



<blockquote><p>The Anonymous movement has shown that you can have meaningful and impactful protests online. And people all across the world are inventing new ways to protest from their home.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>You were trying to occupy a public space?</strong></p>



<p>Any space. After they evicted us from Zuccotti Park, we tried to reestablish a new camp because… well, it was crucial that everyone knew where we were. That was what was so effective about the original occupation: anyone in the city who felt they wanted to get involved knew where they could go and plug in instantly.</p>



<p>At first we thought we could relocate to a huge lot near Wall Street that belong to the Episcopalian Church, they agreed, but huge pressure was place on the Church hierarchy and eventually they reversed themselves. We had a march led by several bishops trying to occupy anyway; the cops beat us up, and the media refused to show any footage of the priests but only anyone in masks to make us look violent and scary.</p>



<p>Then we occupied a park that was open all night and they changed the rules of the park. We then got a legal ruling from a judge that we could sleep on the sidewalk as long as we do not take more than half of it. So the city just passed an order that Lower Manhattan was an emergency zone where legal decisions do not apply. So we decided to occupy the stairs of the building where the Bill of Rights was actually signed, which is right near Wall Street incidentally, but wasn’t under city jurisdiction. We were immediately were surrounded by SWAT teams and after two days they found a way to force us from there.</p>



<p>We tried everything to set up a legal alternative. But the state completely simply shredded the very legal principles that they teach children are what makes them proud to be Americans, and the media didn’t even cover it.</p>



<p><strong>But what can you occupy when you are not allowed to even leave your own apartment?</strong></p>



<p>There are always things you can do. The Anonymous movement has shown that you …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization">No free lunch theorem</a> states that for any learning algorithm, any improvement on performance over one class of problems is balanced out by a decrease in the performance over another class <a href="#wolpert1997no">(Wolpert &amp; Macready, 1997)</a>. In other words, <strong>there is no “one size fits all” learning algorithm</strong>.</p>

<p>We can see this in practice in the deep learning world. Among the various neural network architectures, each of them are better or worse for solving different tasks based on their inductive biases. For example, consider the image classification problem. CNNs are the de facto choice for processing images and in general data with grid-like topology. Sparse connectivity and parameter sharing in CNNs make them an effective and statistically efficient architecture.</p>

<p>The convolution operation in combination with max pooling makes CNNs approximately invariant to translation.
When a module is translation invariant, it means that if we apply translation transformation on the input image, i.e., change the position of the objects in the input, the output of the module won’t change. In mathematical terms if  is translation invariant, then , where  is a translation function.
A module could also be translation equivariant, which means that any translation in the input will be reflected in the output. In mathematical terms, if  is translation equivariant, then .
The convolution operation is translation equivariant, and applying a pooling operation on top of it results in translation invariance!</p>

        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/translation_invariance.gif" alt="Translation Invariance"></p><p>Translation invariance</p>
    
</div>

<p>Translation invariance of CNNs improves their generalization and makes them data efficient compared to fully connected networks. For example, if, during training, a CNN has only seen pictures of cats where the cat is located at the centre of the image, it can correctly classify cats at test time independent of their position in the image.  In the lack of this inductive bias, the model needs to see examples of cats at different positions to be able to correctly classify them at test time.
On the other hand, this translation invariance can hurt the performance of CNNs in cases where the position of the objects in the image matters. This is known as the Picasso effect, where you have all the pieces of an object but not in the right context (One of the motivations behind <a href="http://samiraabnar.github.io/articles/2019-03/capsule">CapsNets</a> is to address this drawback).</p>

</div>

<p>Another example of such tradeoffs are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in contrast to Transformers. It has been shown that the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs helps them capture hierarchical structures in sequences (<a href="https://samiraabnar.github.io/articles/2020-05/recurrence">Take a look at my other blog post about the recurrecnt inductive bias</a>). But this recurrence and the fact that RNNs’ access to previous tokens is limited to their memory makes it harder for them to deal with long term dependencies.
Besides, RNNs can be rather slow because they have to process data sequentially, i.e, they are not parallelizable. On the other hand, Transformers have direct access to all input tokens and they are very expressive when it comes to representing longer context sizes. Also, they can process the input sequence in parallel, hence they can be remarkably faster than LSTMs. However, Transformers struggle to generalize on tasks that require capturing hierarchical structures when training data is limited.</p>

<p>It might not be possible to have one model that can single handedly achieve the desired generalization behaviour on a wide range of tasks, but would it be possible to benefit from the inductive biases of different models during training to have one best model at inference?</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems to be possible to do this to some extent!
In this post, I discuss our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00555">“Transferring Inductive Biases through Knowledge Distillation”</a>, where we show that it is possible to transfer the effect of inductive bias through knowledge distillation and this can be a step toward achieving the goal of combining the strengths of multiple models in one place.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-inductive-bias">What is Inductive bias?</h4>
<p>Inductive biases are the characteristics of learning algorithms that influence their generalization behaviour, independent of data. They are one of the main driving forces to push learning algorithms toward particular solutions <a href="#mitchell1980need">(Mitchell, 1980)</a>.
In the absence of strong inductive biases, a model can be equally attracted to several local minima on the loss surface; and the converged solution can be arbitrarily affected by random variations, for instance, the initial state or the order of training examples <a href="#sutskever2013importance">(Sutskever et al., 2013; McCoy et al., 2020; Dodge et al., 2020)</a>.</p>

<p>In figure below, we see a schematic example of the paths that different instances of two models with different levels of inductive biases follow on a fitness landscape.<sup id="fnref:3be40dd2"><a href="#fn:3be40dd2">1</a></sup></p>

The inductive biases are shown by colored regions (green and yellow) which indicates regions that models prefer to explore.</p>
    
</div>

<p>There are two types of inductive biases: <strong>restricted hypothesis space bias</strong> and <strong>preference bias</strong>. Restricted hypothesis space bias determines the expressively of a model, while preference bias weighs the solutions within the hypothesis space <a href="#Craven1996ExtractingCM">(Craven, 1996)</a>.</p>

<p>From another point of view, as formulated by <a href="#seuncurve">(Seung et al., 1991)</a> we can study models from two aspects:</p>

  <li>Whether a solution is realisable for the model, i.e., there is at least one set of weights that leads to the optimal solution.</li>
  <li>Whether a solution is learnable for the model, i.e., it is possible for the model to learn that solution within a reasonable amount of time and computations.</li>
</ol>

<p>In many cases in deep learning, we are dealing with models that have enough expressive power to solve our problems, however, they have different preference biases. Meaning the desired solutions are realisable for all of them, but depending on the task at hand it is more easier for some of them to learn the solutions compared to the others.</p>

<!-- So,once we have the desired solution, we might be able to guid the other models toward that  solution. -->

<h4 id="having-the-right-inductive-bias-matters">Having the Right Inductive Bias Matters</h4>
<p>To understand the effect of inductive biases of a model, we need to take a look at its generalization behaviour.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through the example of LSTMs and Transformers.
When we train these models on language modelling, i.e., predicting the next word in a sequence, they both achieve more or less similar perplexities.
But how can we know which one is learning a more generlizable solution? One way to check the generalizability of language models is to test how well they have learned the syntactic rules of the language and the hierarchical structures of the sentences.
The task of subject-verb agreement is designed for this purpose, i.e., to assess the ability of models to caputre hierchical structure in the language.
In this task, the goal for the model is to predict the number of a masked verb in a given sentence. To do this, the model needs to correctly recognize the subject of the verb in the sentence and the main difficulty is when the verb does not follow the subject immediately and there are one or more agreement attractors<sup id="fnref:f53f52f4"><a href="#fn:f53f52f4">2</a></sup> between the subject and the verb. In the figure below, we see an example for this task.</p>

</div>

<p>Comparing different instances of LSTMs and Transformers, with different perplexities, we observe that LSTMs have a higher tendency toward solutions that achieve better accuracy on the <a href="https://github.com/TalLinzen/rnn_agreement">subject verb agreement task</a>. We can see that, LSTMs with worse perplexities achieve better accuracies than Transformers with better perplexities.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, let’s go back to the CNN example and see how the inductive bias of CNNs works in practice.
We can view CNNs as MLPs with an inﬁnitely strong prior over their weights, which says that the weights for one hidden unit must be identical to the weights of its neighbor but shifted in space, also that the weights must be zero, except for in the small, spatially contiguous receptive ﬁeld assigned to that hidden unit <a href="#Goodfellow-et-al-2016">(Goodfellow et al., 2016)</a>.
Hence, to measure the effectiveness of the CNNs inductive biases we can compare them to MLPs.
Here you can see the results of training CNNs and MLPs on the MNIST dataset and evaluating them on the translated and scaled version of MNIST from the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/mnist-c">MNIST-C</a> dataset.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div>
    
        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/Screenshot%202020-05-25%20at%2012.16.21.png" alt=""></p><p>Accuracy and Expected Calibration Error (mean$\pm$std over multiple trials) of CNNs and MLPs trained on MNIST and evaluated on MNIST, MNIST-Scaled and MNIST-Translated</p>
    
</div>

<p>As expected, even though the accuracies of MLPs and CNNs are only slightly different on the original MNIST test set, CNNs can generalize much better to the out of distribution test sets that include translated and scaled MNIST examples.</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-distillation-to-the-rescue">Knowledge Distillation to the Rescue</h4>
<p>There are different ways to inject inductive biases into learning algorithms, for instance, through architectural choices, the objective function, curriculum  strategy, or the optimisation regime.
Here, we exploit the power of Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer the effect of inductive biases between neural networks.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->

Featuring a cubist portrait."></p><p>A drawing of how inductive biases can be transferred through distillation. The inductive biases are shown by colored regions (green and yellow) which indicates regions that models prefer to explore.</p>
    
</div>

<p>KD refers to the process of transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, where the logits from the teacher are used to train the student. It is best known as an effective method for model compression <a href="#hinton2015distilling">(Hinton et al., 2015)</a> which allows taking advantage of the huge number of parameters during training, without losing the efficiency of a smaller model during inference.
When we have a teacher that performs very well on a given task, using it to train another model can lead to an improved performance in the student …</p></article></div>

When I say “trying”, I really meant I spent some time configuring and using those editors. The ones I spent time using are:</p>

<li><a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, my main, daily editor I use for pretty much almost all projects I work on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, that I currently use at work to hack on Java codebases.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, that I have been trying mainly in Rust, TOML and Markdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">emacs</a>, that I highly hacked around to play on my Haskell and Rust codebases (and YAML / Markdown / TOML too).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">DOOM Emacs</a>, that I tried when I saw a colleague in a previous company I worked in (I was impressed by the “united” feeling of the UI and by how everything looked so slick). So I gave it a try.</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s take on editors. Same thing, mostly Rust, Haskell, etc.</li>
<li>A bunch of others that I won’t talk about because I quickly stopped using.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this article is to create a temporal “snapshot” of my views on editors and what I think about the current situation. I have been using vim and especially neovim for more than a decade. I need to explain about my current workflow and what I cherish in editing before talking about each editors. Expect a point of view from a neovimer which is looking around at lots of editors.</p>

<p>This is only a personal workflow / point of view that works well <em>for me right now</em>. It doesn’t mean it will for you and it doesn’t mean a different workflow would be worse.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard layout</h2>
<p>I am French and I’m using a keyboard layout that is made to type very quickly in French and to code. With hindsight, since I type more often in English than in French, maybe I should have picked another keyboard layout, but the coding experience in my keyboard layout is really great, so I stick around.</p>
<p>The keyboard layout is <strong>bépo</strong>. I learned bépo the “recommended” way — i.e.&nbsp;you have to practice <em>typing</em> (« dactylographie » in French). It means that I use all my fingers to type on a keyboard, and that each key on the keyboard is assigned <em>a single finger</em> that will press it. That helps a lot with muscle memory and to reduce wrist pain (my wrists barely move when I type on a keyboard), among other things. The typing speed is a side-effect of being accurate and having good comfort (if you are curious, I’m pretty fast but there are faster people — I type at around 120 to 130 words per minute). Because I think the speed doesn’t matter when programming, I think the most important part to remember here is the comfort: the wrists don’t move and my fingers fly around the keyboard, whatever the speed.</p>
<h2 id="modal-editors">Modal editors</h2>
<p>I think a modal editor is superior, for various reasons. The first one is that I truly <strong>hate</strong> having to use a <em>mouse</em> for something that can be done without having to move around hundred of pixels with your cursor and clicking on buttons. For instance, running an application, on my current machines, is simply typing <code>alt d</code>, the name of the program (I typically use completion, so I never type fully the name of the program) and hit enter. All this without moving my hands from the keyboard. And I do that for programs like <code>firefox</code>, <code>kdenlive</code>, etc. but for terminal applications, I simply type and complete them in my terminal, which I open simply with <code>alt return</code>.</p>
<p>So, using a mouse to move around a cursor in an editor feels like completely suboptimal to me, especially because we write code (i.e.&nbsp;we type on a keyboard) most of the time, so moving around with the mouse implies several back and forth movements between the keyboard and the mouse. Maybe you don’t care and it’s cool to you, but to me, this is truly <em>horror land</em>. I feel <em>very</em> uncomfortable when doing this.</p>
<p>Also, <em>modern editors</em> that are not modal typically make people move by using the arrows keys, which are either far on your keyboard, or — like my keyboard, a 60% home made one — not in direct access and then require a function key to enable them.</p>
<p>So that’s the first reason why I like modal editors. They make a smarter use of your keyboard for simple yet recurrent features, like moving around — e.g.&nbsp;<code>h j k l</code>. The second reason why I like them is because of the facts they have a completely new mode for non-modal editor (i.e.&nbsp;the <em>normal</em> mode), you have a whole keyboard / lots of keys to bind actions to and do lots of things people usually do with the mouse. Being able to split an editor into several buffers, move around the buffers, go at the beginning of the paragraph, search and replace, register actions into macros and replay them, etc. All this without even moving the wrists. The learning curve is steep if you’re used to the mouse, but once you’ve passed the mental barrier, really, and this is a personal opinion, but I truly think that using the mouse again after that feels like handicap to me.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-like-to-move-around">How I like to move around</h2>
<p>When I look at people coding, I see several kind of programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ones who move with the arrows or with <code>h j k l</code> in modal editors. You can spot them very easily at how the cursor moves in a document. It typically implies keeping a key pressed until the cursor reach a given row, then pressing another key until the cursor reach a given column and then adjust if they went passed the location they had in mind.</li>
<li>People using the mouse, by clicking at the place they want to put the cursor at.</li>
<li>People using <em>relative numbers</em>. That’s an enhancement of the first group: they typically use relative numbers to know which lines they want to jump to very quickly, so that they don’t have to press the up / down keys for ages until reaching the line they want to. Instead, they look at the number on the lines, press that number, and the direction, and bam, they are on the lines. They then use typical motions from vim like <code>$</code> (go to end of line), <code>f</code> (go to the first occurrence of the next character typed after <code>f</code>, like <code>f(</code> will make your cursor go to the next <code>(</code>), <code>%</code> (go to the matching delimiter) or <code>w</code> (go to the beginning of the next word) / <code>b</code> (go to the beginning of the previous word), etc. to move faster on the same line (it works across lines too).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents 99,9% of what I see people do. Obviously, you will get that I don’t belong to the second set of people… but I don’t really belong to any, actually. How I move is, I guess, convoluted for most people and I know some people won’t understand how it can feel. I use <code>h j k l</code> and all the motions from vim described in the third group (and even more; I full lecture of four hours would be required to explain all of them :D), but it all depends on the <em>distance</em> I need to travel. If my cursor is on a word and I want to move to the beginning of a word located very closely to my cursor on the same line, I’ll simply type <code>www</code> if it’s three words apart (or <code>3w</code> if I’m feeling funny). If the distance is higher, I use a tool called [EasyMotion].</p>
<p>Easymotion really is a wonderful tool. The idea is that it has several modes, depending on the kind of move you want to perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>By lines</em>: this mode allows you to jump to any line in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By words</em>: tihs mode allows you to jump to any “word” in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By characters</em>: when the <em>word</em> mode doesn’t help with jumping to a special operator or character (because it’s not recognized as a word), this mode allows you to jump to any character in the current or (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li>It has other modes but I have never really found useful cases for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I typically do it is by mapping the three modes to <code>&lt;leader&gt;l</code>, <code>&lt;leader&gt;w&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;leader&gt;c</code> (in my case, <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> is the <em>space</em> key).</p>
<p>Typing <code>SPC l</code> in my current buffer results in this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_lines.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion lines</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typing any highlighted character will make my cursor jump to it. The same applies for words, with <code>SPC w</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_words.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion words</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the <em>character</em> mode, after pressing <code>SPC c</code>, I have to press another character (the one I want to jump to). Let’s say we want to jump to a <code>#</code> (which is not part of words): <code>SPC c #</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_chars.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion characters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This way of moving is not intuitive at first, but once you get used to it… it’s a <em>must have</em>.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-other-modal-candies">All the other modal candies</h2>
<p>Among all the things that I like about modal editing, here is a non-exhaustive list of features I expect to have around my fingers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-i</code> and <code>C-o</code>: those allows me to jump to something / a file / a place in a buffer and then go back to where I was right before with <code>C-o</code> (read it like <em>out</em>) or go back again with <code>C-i</code> (read it like <em>in</em>).</li>
<li>Macros and registers: those allow me to yank content into different registers (like clipboards) by assigning a single key to paste their content. For instance, I can put a few lines in my <code>t</code> register with <code>"tyi(</code> (“put in the <code>t</code> register the <code>y</code>ank <code>i</code>nside matching <code>(</code>), and paste that content later with <code>"tp</code>. Macros allow more powerful editing control by assigning a key to set of actions with the <code>q</code> keyword (<code>qa</code> will register all the next keystrokes and actions into the <code>a</code> macro). Then simply replay the macro with <code>@a</code>, for instance.</li>
<li>Obviously, all the basic vim motions, like <code>d</code> to delete, <code>y</code> to yank, <code>c</code> to change, <code>t</code> to go to the character right before the one you search, <code>%</code> to go to the other delimiter, etc. And more complex text manipulation, such as “Let’s change what’s inside this function parameter list, delimited by <code>(</code>”: <code>ci(</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take too much time to list everything, but the main idea is: I need the modal features when editing code.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about the list of editors I mentioned in the preface. The idea is to give <em>my own opinion</em> on those …</p></div></section></div>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published September 06, 2020</p><p>PostgreSQL 13 development is coming along nicely, Postgres 13 Beta3 was
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2060/">released on 8/13/2020</a>.
The Postgres Beta 1 and 2 releases were released in May and June 2020.
One of the features that has my interest in Postgres 13 is the B-Tree deduplication effort.  B-Tree indexes are the default indexing method
in Postgres, and are likely the most-used indexes in production 
environments.
Any improvements to this part of the database are likely to have wide-reaching benefits.
Removing duplication from indexes keeps their physical size smaller,
reduces I/O overhead, and should help keep <code>SELECT</code> queries fast!</p>
<!--endteaser-->

<blockquote>
<p>This post is part of the series <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2018/06/pg-series-toc"><em>PostgreSQL:  From Idea to Database</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a good summary of the what and how of this improvement
in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/b-tree-index-deduplication/">Laurenz Albe's post</a> from early in June 2020, presumably using
Pg13 Beta1.  <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2020/07/06/features-in-pg13-deduplication-in-b-tree-indexes/">Hamid Akhtar's post in July</a>
covered this feature using Pg13 Beta2 and a different approach including
a look at the performance using <code>EXPLAIN</code>.
This post takes yet another look at this improvement using Pg13 Beta3.
I intend to see how well this improvement pans out on a data set I use in production.  For that task my go-to is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.</p>
<h2>Install Postgres 13 Beta 3</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the two versions of Postgres (12 and 13beta3) 
on a single Ubuntu 18 host.  In the past when I have tested pre-production
releases I have built Postgres from source instead of using <code>apt</code>.
This time around I decided to use <code>apt install</code>, so am including the
basic process for that.</p>
<p>The advised way to install PostgreSQL is from the pgdg (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repositories,
see <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">the Postgres wiki</a> for more.
To enable the beta versions, the line needed in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/bionic-pgdg main 13
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, update the sources and install Postgres and PostGIS.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
# Postgres 12
sudo apt install postgresql-12 postgresql-12-postgis-3
# Postgres 13 (Currently Beta)
sudo apt install postgresql-13 postgresql-13-postgis-3
</code></pre>
<p>On Ubuntu, installing multiple versions will create multiple instances running on different ports. The test server I'm using to write this post
currently has three versions of Postgres installed, only two are currently running. Postgres 12 was installed first so "won" the default port of 5432.  Postgres 11 was installed second and was assigned 5433, and Pg13 beta 3 was installed last and was assigned port 5434.  The <code>pg_lsclusters</code> is avaiable on Debian/Ubuntu hosts as part of the wrapper around <code>pg_ctl</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u postgres pg_lsclusters
Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
11  main    5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log
12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log
13  main    5434 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/13/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This post does not use Postgres 11 beyond this example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working with multiple versions installed it is helpful to verify
versions match what you expect them to be.
First, the port 5432 for Postgres 12 version.</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgosm -p 5432 -c "select version();"

<h2>Create Indexes</h2>
<p>Both versions of Postgres were loaded with the same Colorado OpenStreetMap
data loaded <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.
The osm2pgsql does not create any B-Tree indexes on its own, only the GIST
indexes on geometries.
For this post, we examine B-Tree index sizes created on four columns:
<code>osm_id</code>, <code>highway</code>, <code>waterway</code>, and <code>natural</code>.
Looking at the stats on the <code>public.planet_osm_line</code> table I can make 
a couple guesses where we will and will not see gains based on <code>n_distinct</code>.
I can guess we will not see major gains in the
<code>osm_id</code>, there is only a small amount of duplication in those values.
The other three columns (<code>highway</code>, <code>natural</code> and <code>waterway</code>) have a small number of distinct values
and varying amounts of <code>NULL</code> values.  These three columns would all
be candidates for partial indexes to avoid indexing the <code>NULL</code> values,
thus reducing the size of the created index.
I have hopes to see the benefits in Postgres 13 on these columns, possibly
making the use of partial indexes less frequent.</p>
<pre><code> SELECT attname, n_distinct, null_frac
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stats
    WHERE tablename = 'planet_osm_line'
        AND attname IN ('osm_id', 'highway', 'waterway', 'natural')
;

â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<h3>Index on <code>osm_id</code></h3>
<p>First up is the <code>osm_id</code> column, a nearly unique set of positive and 
negative values.  The index to create in both versions:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_osm_id ON public.planet_osm_line (osm_id);
</code></pre>
<p>The following query is used throughout to report out index sizes.
The query itself will not be repeated, as only the filter would change.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ai.schemaname AS s_name, ai.relname AS t_name,
        ai.indexrelname AS index_name,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text)) AS index_size,
        pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text) AS index_size_bytes
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes ai
    WHERE ai.indexrelname LIKE 'ix_osm_line%'
    ORDER BY index_name
;
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the low number of duplicates, it is no surprise that the
show only a tiny reduction in the size.  The reduction
would not be detectable from only the <code>index_size</code> column (in MB), the
<code>index_size_bytes</code> shows the slight reduction in size (29,515,776 bytes vs. 29,384,704 bytes).</p>

</code></pre>
<h3>Index on <code>highway</code></h3>
<p>The <code>highway</code> data in the <code>planet_osm_line</code> data is a good example of when
a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html">partial index</a>
might typically be a good idea to minimize index size.  My hunch (and hope)
is that the de-duplication will make a partial index here a moot point by reducing the size required to index a large number of <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
<p>Create two indexes, one partial covering the non-<code>NULL</code> values and one full
index on the entire table.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_partial 
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway)
    WHERE highway IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_full
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway);
</code></pre>
<p>The two indexes in Postgres 12, notice the partial index cuts out about 1/3 of the size from the full index.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”…</code></pre></div></div>

September 6, 2020 | https://preslav.me/2020/09/06/elixir-is-not-ruby-elixir-is-erlang/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://preslav.me/2020/09/06/elixir-is-not-ruby-elixir-is-erlang/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Try to remember the first time you heard about this fascinating language called <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. Chances are, you had by the time been developing software using Ruby. If that's the case, Elixir seems to have appeared out of nowhere until suddenly, it became the solution for all your previous problems. It is fast, clean, scales extremely well. It was <strong>almost</strong> like the Ruby you've always wanted to have, but never got.</p><p>I say <strong>almost</strong>, because as much as you want it to be, <strong>Elixir is not Ruby</strong>. The familiar syntax has definitely helped the language win the hearts of the broader developer community. Yet, under the hood, <strong>Elixir is all about Erlang.</strong> The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Erlang</a> that everyone tells stories about, as if it were some mythical creature, but no one dares to touch.</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/09/book-cover.png" alt="" width="500" height="700"><figcaption>Elixir for Non-Ruby Programmers</figcaption></figure><p>Why am I saying all of this? First, because I would love to see greater adoption of Elixir outside Ruby/Rails community. It was among that group of people where the idea first sparked, and I fully respect the fact. Nevertheless, I would love to see it growing out. As someone who discovered Elixir after years of doing Java, &nbsp;.NET and more recently, Go, I can say that there is enough goodness in it for everyone. Moreover, bringing people with different backgrounds (both technical and non-technical) will lead to an explosion of new ideas. Having more diverse minds will help us better understand and make use of the elephant in the room-Erlang.</p><p>This brings me to my second point. Erlang is not obscure at all, once you give it enough attention. It is actually oddly satisfying, once you start reading code written in it. I have had my few a-ha moments, when I figured the original inspiration for most constructs in Elixir. The point is, we shouldn't fear Erlang, but try to understand it.

<p>What happens when you call LinearRegression().fit(X,y)?</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://blog.stevenchun.me/2020/04/linear-regression-I/" data-popup-title="Under the Hood: Linear Regression" data-popup-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg" data-popup-abstract="It's not your Grandfather's Econometrics!">last post,
</a> we derived the least squares normal equations.</p>

<p>So, from a theoretical standpoint you’d be 100% correct if you said,
“Scikit-learn solves the least squares normal equations”. Good job. And to go
further, you could talk about using different matrix factorizations to
efficiently solve the normal equations, like SVD or QR or LU. But there’s a
story we miss by ignoring the actual code and hardware that will solve least
squares.</p>
<p>Like pretty much all modern software, Scikit-learn and its contemporaries stand
on the shoulders of giants: NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and work done in the 70s to revolutionize scientific computing.</p>
<p>Understanding this work and its modern forms is critical to an end-to-end
understanding of why your 2015 Macbook is burning the tops of your thighs as you
run an ill advised regression for a term paper. This is not a particularly
technical post, as I don’t think I could do justice to the hardware
optimizations involved. Instead, we’ll dig into modern linear regression as a
way to develop a mental picture of the structures involved.</p>
<p>Scikit’s <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression — scikit-learn 0.23.2 documentation" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="scikit-learn: machine learning in Python">documentation
</a> mentions that its LinearRegression model is “just plain Ordinary Least Squares (scipy.linalg.lstsq)”. Okay, what is
Scipy doing?</p>
<p>A cursory examination of the <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/99b8660a5bb838cfcebf5e9e63512aed982a40e8/scipy/linalg/basic.py#L1047" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="scipy/scipy" data-popup-image="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/288277?s=400&amp;v=4" data-popup-abstract="Scipy library main repository.

</a> reveals that
it…doesn’t do anything? It checks for any mismatch in the shapes of the
input, but there’s no matrix factoring, not even a dot product.</p>
<h2 id="LAPACK-and-BLAS"><a href="#LAPACK-and-BLAS" title="LAPACK and BLAS"></a>LAPACK and BLAS</h2><p>Rather than performing the calculations itself, SciPy actually calls a LAPACK
subroutine to do all the matrix factoring work. Which subroutine depends on
which option you pass to it: “gelsd” for divide-and-conquer SVD, “gelsy” for
complete orthogonal factorization, or “gels” for QR/LQ factorization. LAPACK in
turn calls a BLAS subroutine to do all the scalar, vector, and matrix work.
These programs are very particular. Different architectures will have different
implementations.
Some of the really-fast implementations were hand-written by a guy on sabbatical
from the Japanese Patent Office.</p>
<h3 id="LAPACK"><a href="#LAPACK" title="LAPACK"></a>LAPACK</h3><p>LAPACK was a project out of Tennessee and Rice Universities, the Numerical
Algorithms Group, a private non-profit, and Oak Ridge and Argonne National
Laboratories in the early 90s. This assemblage of researchers all saw the need
for a standardized, fast package that provided “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/220781801_LAPACK_A_Portable_Linear_Algebra_Library_for_High-Performance_Computers/links/00b7d519e119d012bc000000/LAPACK-A-Portable-Linear-Algebra-Library-for-High-Performance-Computers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bischof/publication/220781801_LAPACK_A_Portable_Linear_Algebra_Library_for_High-Performance_Computers/links/00b7d519e119d012bc000000/LAPACK-A-Portable-Linear-Algebra-Library-for-High-Performance-Computers.pdf" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="">routines for solving systems of
simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of overdetermined
systems of equations, and eigenvalue problems.
</a>”</p>
<p>These sorts of things had been tried before in LINPACK and EISPACK, but those
packages weren’t written with modern computer architectures in mind. The
original Intel Pentium chip had come out in 1993 and brought a split L1 cache<label for="ad0dd30cc0a2320fb30580b38d61955c0ad19c9df743e3b0bf43dfeb0b6e53c4"></label><span> If you have a rough idea of what an L1 cache is, here’s an insanely thorough

was also releasing some very nice x86 chips. But then, Quake was released by id
Software, which targeted the Pentium processor’s ability to interleave floating
point and integer operations, something Cyrix’s chips couldn’t do. “Quake was
extremely popular, and everyone used it in their performance tests – and thus
hammered the Cyrix chips, even though the Cyrix was faster in ordinary use, in
business/work/Windows operation, indeed in every other game except Quake. And
ultimately that killed Cyrix off.”  From <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/49259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="The rise &amp; fall of the first real x86 rival to Intel: the Cyrix 6x86" data-popup-image="https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png" data-popup-abstract="I was surprised to read someone castigating and condemning the Cyrix line of PC CPUs today.

set first used on the Intel 8086 chip, the precursor to the Pentium? I didn’t.
Well, now I do. Such is the epistemic problem of writing a blog post in order to
learn about what you’re writing about.
</span>. The basic problem here is that CPUs got quite fast at
multiplying numbers, but accessing those numbers from memory hadn’t kept up. So,
programs that didn’t pay attention to the cost of moving data started being
bottlenecked by the speed of memory access rather than the speed of their
processors.</p>
<p>LAPACK was written in FORTRAN 77 for modern memory hierarchies with multiple
parallel, processors; and that made it stupid fast. Of course, you can’t write a
library that’ll be optimal for all architectures. You have different cache
sizes; you might have an L3 or L4 cache. But LAPACK didn’t need to, because it
wasn’t actually doing the low-level calculations. For that, it relied on
whatever Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines—BLAS<label for="e6cd2e246ce0576c0ea8487b43e72e470d101ecc87c677ed98fd670616ef5b6e"></label><span> Obviously. Honestly, I’m way more in on the all-cap, pronounceable acronym,
compared to like, the current state of open source naming. I mean look at the
<a href="https://www.apache.org/index.html#projects-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Welcome to The Apache Software Foundation!" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="Home page of The Apache Software Foundation">list of projects

Oh God, there’s a project called <a href="http://chemistry.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chemistry</a>, please let it have something to do
with—No. From its homepage: “Important time-saving note for chemists: the Apache
Chemistry project has nothing to do with chemistry or chemicals!” It’s a CMS
interoperability standard. And Steve? Steve is the Foundation’s python-based
voting system.
</span>— the user had installed.</p>
<h3 id="BLAS"><a href="#BLAS" title="BLAS"></a>BLAS</h3><p>In the late 70s, the nerds at JPL came out with a FORTRAN library of
thirty-eight basic linear algebra subroutines. Stuff like a dot-product,
implemented in a way that was fast and correct. This way an aeronautical
engineer didn’t have to worry that his code for, like, a 2-norm<label for="221c330c1fb37958b3a7aeba1299318f19846fae4c652d177db65ff3cd1cd4aa"></label><span> A 2-norm is just the Euclidean distance of the vector. I have no idea how it
should interact with complex numbers. This way, I don’t have to!
</span> handled a
complex vector correctly. And that might mean fewer rocket crashes.</p>
<p>While it started out as an actual library, BLAS persisted more as a
specification. Anyone could write a BLAS implementation that was fast on their
hardware, and any program designed to use BLAS could use any of these
implementations.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this on a Mac, you’re running <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Apple Developer Documentation" data-popup-image="" data-popup-abstract="">Apple’s implementation
</a> of BLAS
and LAPACK, specially optimized, like much of Apple software, for its own
hardware.</p>
<p>There’s a useful idea here that some constructs are so widely used that it’s
worth a lot of effort to eek out small performance gains which then aggregate to
huge performance gains.</p>
<p>One example from a 2017 talk on Google’s<label for="04aa2b4d1a716f77545c559a01ac048a92f2ad4dd1c31988ec4cf32af492f5a3"></label><span>Disclaimer: I work at Google. I was not involved in this work.
</span> efforts to develop faster, more
efficient hash tables:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hash tables are incredibly performance sensitive. At Google, right now, as I am
speaking, in our fleet, one percent of the CPU’s are computing something in a
hash table. As I am speaking, more than four percent of Google’s RAM is owned by
a hash table. And that’s just C++”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same idea applies to a dot product. If your supercomputer weather simulation
does a lot of dot products, you might save days of compute time by having a good
BLAS implementation for your hardware.</p>
<p>This is where Mr. Kazushige Goto comes in.</p>
<h2 id="The-Man-from-the-Patent-Office"><a href="#The-Man-from-the-Patent-Office" title="The Man from the Patent Office"></a>The Man from the Patent Office</h2><p><img src="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2005/11/28/business/28super.1841.jpg" alt="Kazushige Goto standing next to a research
poster"></p>
<p>Prior to 2002, Kazushige Goto worked in the Japanese Patent Office. While he was
there, he developed a knack for tinkering with the subroutines on computers to
improve bottlenecks. I say this, of course, in the same sense that Babe Ruth
developed a knack for hitting home runs. From a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/technology/writing-the-fastest-code-by-hand-for-fun-a-human-computer-keeps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-popup-title="Writing the Fastest Code, by Hand, for Fun: A Human Computer Keeps Speeding Up Chips" data-popup-image="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" data-popup-abstract="Kazushige Goto, research associate at Texas Advanced Computing Center at University of Texas in Austin, has become legend in world of supercomputing by single-handedly producing at his keyboard programs that run world's fastest computers and doing it faster than powerful automated systems and entire teams of software developers; value of his work goes far beyond setting speed records because Goto's programs can more efficiently solve complex linear equations, thus offering better solutions in virtually every computational science and engineering problem; photo (M)">2005 New York Times profile
</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To help in his work, Mr. Goto purchased a Digital Equipment workstation based
on the Alpha microprocessor in 1994 to perform a simulation.  But when it
arrived he could not understand why it was performing so slowly. So he explored
the Alpha’s design to see where the performance bottlenecks were.</p>
<p>He later purchased a second Alpha-based computer and by rewriting the crucial
subroutines was able to improve its performance to 78 percent of its theoretical
peak calculating speed, up from 44 percent.</p>
<p>Although he was not formally trained in computer or software design, he
perfected his craft by learning from programmers on an Internet mailing list
focusing on the Linux operating system for the Alpha chip. His curiosity quickly
became a passion that he pursued in his free time and during his twice daily
two-hour train commute between his job in Tokyo and his home in Kanagawa
Prefecture.</p>
<p>‘I would frequently work on these problems until midnight,’ he said. ‘I did it
to relax.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, this sort of hardware whispering doesn’t go unnoticed,
and eventually Mr. Goto got the call up to the Texas Advanced Computer Center at
UT Austin to apply his gifts to supercomputing while on sabbatical from the
patent office. At the time of this profile, 4 out of the 11 fastest
supercomputers were running GotoBLAS, Goto’s optimized implementation for
Intel’s Nehalem processor.</p>
<p>The narrative of Goto-the-Auteur’s is painted in sharp relief to contemporary
efforts to automate the process of optimizing BLAS for different processors. The
Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software or ATLAS is a BLAS implementation
that can perform a sort of hyperparameter sweep on any processor to identify a
reasonably good BLAS implementation. This sort of approach means that ATLAS is
often the first good BLAS implementation available on a new processor, but is
eventually eclipsed by hand-tuned implementations.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I find this immensely aesthetic. The idea that deep learning,
whose signature trait seems to be the ability to replicate those domains of
man—art, perception, language—with all its …</p></article></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he only person David Kiragu lied to about the texts was his mom. To those close to him, like his partner, friends, former schoolmates, and work colleagues, he explained what was going on. To more distant contacts, including annoying relatives, he said nothing.</p>



<p>His mother probably knew he was lying — mothers often do — but she let it slide.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t tell her the truth,” Kiragu said to me last December. “So I told her it was one of those prison scams and she should ignore it.”</p>



<p>He owed money. Not a lot of it, but that didn’t matter. His fintech creditor was still telling everyone in Kiragu’s inner circle that he was a deadbeat.</p>



<p>It happened like this: Toward the end of March 2018, Kiragu found himself in a bind. At 32, he earned a solid income as a manager at an iNGO in Nairobi. But for the first time in his life, he couldn’t make rent.</p>



<p>His choices were limited. He could always borrow the remainder from friends, family, or somebody else in his network. The problem was that if he did, people would know he was living beyond his means.</p>



<p>But then one morning Kiragu logged into his Facebook account and saw an ad for a fintech app called OKash that promised to be the discreet friend who would spot him some cash and never mention it again. Offering the ability to “process loans in seconds,” OKash is one of many fintech apps that have sprung up in Kenya since 2012. All he needed to do was download the app, enter his financial details, and let the algorithm generate a credit rating. He would get the money he needed and could pay it back once he was liquid.</p>



<p>He doesn’t remember that day too well now, but Kiragu thinks it took just minutes to apply for his loan. His money arrived right away, so he paid his bills and moved on. “I started with about $15, which I repaid [on time], and my loan limit expanded. Then I borrowed about $35, which I also repaid,” he told me as we sat on the balcony of a chic restaurant in a mall outside Nairobi.</p>



<p>It was the third loan that upended his life. He needed it to top up his rent, because by then a vicious cycle had begun, wherein he would pay off his loan then borrow again to fill the hole that the last payment had left in his finances.</p>



<p>Kiragu started getting calls even before that deadline passed.</p>



<p>“Will you repay your OKash loan?” Kiragu remembers a caller asking him, before warning that if he missed a payment, the company would notify everyone on his contact list. In texts he showed me on his phone, an OKash representative had written an hour before the deadline lapsed, “Despite several polite reminders on your OKash loan . . . No PAYMENT received yet . . . Note that we are going to invade your privacy according to Terms of Service clause 8, IF NOT CLEARED BY 4PM.” The clause in question reads as follows: “In the event we cannot get in contact with you or your emergency contact, you also expressly authorise us to contact any and all persons in your contact list.”</p>



<p>In the days after the deadline, debt collectors hounded Kiragu, calling three to four times every hour. They also cast a wide net. “They texted just about everyone I know,” Kiragu says. His parents and many friends got messages. One of his colleagues even shared a screenshot of a text from OKash in an office-wide WhatsApp Group.</p>



<p>“Some [people] sympathized with me,” Kiragu wrote in a Facebook post about the experience. “Some were laughing at me and some were actually very annoyed that OKash is exposing and shaming me . . . Even my boss called me to ask if everything is okay.”</p>



<p>But his colleagues weren’t his main concern. What worried him more was what his parents would think. After an estranged aunt shared the message within his village, Kiragu’s father accused him of bringing shame on the family.</p>



<p>This was nearly two years ago, but the memory is still raw, so much so that Kiragu asked to use a pseudonym for this article. “If you pay on time, they are angels,” Kiragu said as he sipped his tea and stared at a potted plant behind me. “They keep texting you to take out another loan with them. If you do and won’t or can’t pay, then it’s pretty simple: Pay or we damage what you value most.”</p>

Naomi Wanjiku, a M-Pesa agent, arranges a customer's transaction at a M-Pesa kiosk in South B, a residential area of the city. M-Pesa, (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money), is a Kenyan cellphone-based money transfer service. The majority of its customers have no bank accounts, but they withdraw cash and make payments or send money using their cell phones. A network of appointed agents, scattered all over the country, provide the cashing handling services.

<p><strong>In 2007, Safaricom</strong>, Kenya’s biggest telecoms provider, launched M-Pesa, a mobile wallet that allowed users to send and receive money and buy airtime. Smartphones were just becoming popular, so Safaricom tailored its fintech product to the basic cell phones most Kenyans already owned. It was immediately hailed as a revolutionary way to bring millions of “unbanked” customers into the formal financial sector. The Clinton Global Initiative and other major philanthropic organizations were vocal supporters, and it was soon being taught as a case study in business schools around the world. It was also a success on the ground: Safaricom aimed to sign up 350,000 M-Pesa users by the end of 2007, but by November it had already attracted over 1 million. From there, it only continued to grow. As of last September, 23.6 million Kenyans — nearly half of the country’s population — were using it regularly.</p>



<p>M-Pesa was initially meant to be a microfinance project; its first sales pitch to users was “Send Money Home.” It was banking on the fact that while working-class Kenyans who lived away from home wanted to support their families, cash is expensive. This was not a new concept; among Somalis, the Hawala system exists to address this same problem. If you want to send money to someone, you give it to a local agent, who then contacts a second agent located in the same area as the intended recipient, and that agent then disburses the money. Both agents earn a small commission, and they sort each other out.</p>



<p>In Kenya, there were several factors behind M-Pesa’s rapid ascent. One was that 2007 was an election year, and when violence erupted over the results, having a way to transfer money without leaving the house felt to Kenyans like a godsend. Another, more structural, reason was that before M-Pesa, the country’s banking sector served only a portion of the population. Kenya’s economy collapsed four times between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, by which point the banks were heavily regulated. It was nearly impossible for low-income Kenyans, including millennials, to get loans. No such legal barriers applied to fintech.</p>



<p>When fintech took off, banks, Silicon Valley–backed products, private-equity products, and Kenyan companies all began competing for the same clients. One of the first savings-and-lending apps, called M-Shwari, was launched in 2012 through a partnership between a local bank and Safaricom. Some of its earliest users were Kenyans in the informal economy. In a 2017 social media post, for example, a business journalist noted that “up to a third of loans are taken between the hours of 3am and 5am. Most are repaid within twenty-four hours.” When the Central Bank looked into what was going on, they discovered that a typical user was a market seller who would wake up early and borrow enough money to pay everybody in her supply chain that day. She would then work until evening, pay back the loan, and repeat the cycle again the next morning.</p>



<p>Within a few years, credit-app use had started to spread throughout Kenyan society. Over a 13-year period, financial inclusion<a href="https://fsdkenya.org/publication/finaccess2019/"> jumped</a> from nearly 27 percent, in 2006, to almost 83 percent. And the product side grew as well. As of September 2018, according to a report from Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD), the two main app stores offered 110 credit apps.</p>



<p>Almost all of these companies make their money by providing short-term loans with high interest rates. But that’s often where transparency around the business model ends. Since there is no regulatory framework governing fintech, it is hard to know who exactly owns an app or even where the money is coming from. The absence of regulation has many perks for the sector and one major liability: As companies soon discovered, if a user does not pay back what they have borrowed, plus interest, there is little a digital lender can do. Users can simply delete the app and move on. One solution to this problem has been to flag defaulters to one of Kenya’s three credit reference bureaus (CRBs), effectively locking them out of the credit market. It’s unclear how effective this strategy is, but it’s frequently used. Between 2014 and 2017, about 2.7 million Kenyans were negatively listed with a CRB, 15 percent of them for defaulting on loans of less than about $2. Last year, “how to check CRB status” was among the most-Googled questions in Kenya, between “how to be successful in life” and “how to get pregnant.”</p>



<p>Before long, digital lenders started looking into other methods of recouping their investments. Skip tracing, the ancient art of finding someone who owes you money and making them pay, was virtually nonexistent among fintech companies until early 2018. Coincidentally, that was the same year that Opay, a fintech company partially owned by the software-maker Opera, launched OKash in Kenya. The majority of Opera’s operations had been bought by a consortium of Chinese investors two years earlier, and shortly afterward, the company went on an expansion spree, announcing plans to invest $100 million in East Africa. While Opera’s then managing director, a former banker&nbsp; named Edward Ndichu, said at the time that the app would protect users’ personal information, he never explained how the company planned to safeguard its financial investment. But the answer was buried in OKash’s terms and conditions: When users download the app, they give it permission to access their contacts.</p>

<p>Recently I thought a lot about motivation for programming work. I get the feeling that motivation plays a big role on how I work and especially in open source. Motivation seems to affect how I enjoy work, how good the result may be and how fast I find solutions for tricky problems.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-and-open-source">Motivation and Open Source</h2>
<p>For me motivation is especially critical for open source work. I get no money or deadline for open source stuff. It’s completely up to me when I take the time to work on or do nothing for a while. That’s why I need a lot of motivation to do it. Big parts of open source work are not that fun: triageing issues, reviewing complex pull request, fixing complicated bugs, reproduce issues etc. If it’s not fun and nobody pays or expects me to do it, why am I doing this anyway? Those are some of the reasons why I postpone some open source stuff.</p>
<h2 id="working-in-public">“Working In Public”</h2>
<p>I just started reading the book “Working in Public - The making and maintenance of open source software” by Nadia Eghbal. I came across this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>@BALUPTON. via isaacs/github</li>
</ul>
<p>This quote really sums it up in a simple way. I enjoy programming (and work in general) the most when I can create new shiny things that I like and see value in. Working for long stretches on bug fixes and stuff that is less interesting is really hard for me personally.</p>
<p>I like to create new features and projects from scratch with new technologies and ideas. If you can see your success quickly while working and you move forward fast this keeps your motivation going. Seeing pieces come together and people liking your work creates <strong>intrinsic motivation</strong> because you can see your impact of work and therefore you like to work on this because it is fun.</p>
<p>Working on complex stuff where you need to consider 1000 different things, not knowing all moving parts and dealing with issues all the time, needs a lot of discipline and perseverance. If you are stuck on something for a long time it’s easy to loose motivation and start procrastination. Finishing work requires external motivators like people waiting for the outcome of your work or you getting paid to spend this time on stuff that is not really fun.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Motivation is tricky, programming should be fun. Programming and creating new things is such a nice thing that can make me really happy. But a lot of programming at work or in open source is just not fun (maintenance). <strong>Possibly the best thing we can do as programmers is to find a good balance between creation and maintenance to get just the right amount of motivation to keep on finding joy in what we do.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>I recently became curious about what information flow looks like in a p2p distributed system.</p>
<p>As peers produce new data, they send messages to the other peers. It is impossible to know the exact order in which messages were produced, so the best we can do is to <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-explain-partial-order-and-total-order-in-simple-terms/answer/Tikhon-Jelvis?ch=10&amp;share=6e9d9f02&amp;srid=dDQH">partially order</a> them. I wanted to use this partial ordering property to create a graph visualization from an array of messages that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://vivekseth.com/transitive-reduction/graph.png" alt="Graph of partially ordered messages"></p>
<p>Notice how this graph uses the minimum number of edges to represent relationships between nodes. The messages have these relationships, 0 -&gt; 1, 1 -&gt; 2, and 0 -&gt; 2 (transitively), but we don’t draw 0 -&gt; 2 because it is redundant.</p>
<p>Creating an algorithm that can produce a graph like this is not hard. The challenge is making the algorithm fast. My first solution was very slow and took over 60 seconds to build a graph for 400 nodes. After finding a paper from 1972, and optimizing my code with <code>Accelerate</code> (a vector processing framework), I managed to speed up my solution to complete in &lt; 1 second.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-1-algorithm-built-from-scratch">Attempt 1: Algorithm Built From Scratch</h2>
<p>From my undergrad data structures class, I remembered that I could do a topological sort on partially ordered elements. This sort guarantees that for any 2 elements A[i], and A[j] it is not possible for A[i] &gt; A[j] if i &lt; j. In other words, if an element is at index 5, all elements less than it must be located at indices 0 through 4.</p>
<p>Once the elements are sorted, we iterate over each element and try to find its minimal set of neighbors. To find an elements neighbors, we create a prefix array from elements 0 … i-1 and iterate over this list backwards. For each neighbor candidate, we add it to A[i]’s neighbors only if it is not already reachable via graph traversal by another one of its neighbors.</p>
<p>In Swift-like psuedo code, the algorithm looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>protocol</span> <span>PartialOrder</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>Node</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>graph</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This algorithm has a run time of O(n * n * (n + e)). Roughly speaking it is O(n^3). On my computer it takes 60 seconds to complete for 400 nodes.</p>
<p>This felt extremely slow, and I wondered if we could do better than this.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-2-naive-transitive-reduction">Attempt 2: Naive Transitive Reduction</h2>
<p>Maybe there were existing algorithms that could help. I have seen graphs similar to the one I was trying to build, so I felt that there might be an existing algorithm I could use.</p>
<p>I searched for “how to graph partially ordered set algorithm”, and came across this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11409929/algorithm-for-constructing-hasse-diagram">Stack Overflow post</a> which was exactly what I was looking for. According to the post, the type of graph I am trying to make is a <em>Hasse diagram</em>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11413022">One answer</a> pointed out that the algorithm used to construct a Hasse diagram is called a <em>transitive reduction</em> . I learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction">Wikipedia</a> that the transitive reduction of a graph produces a graph that maintains transitive relationships with as few nodes as possible. If A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, and A-&gt;C, the transitive reduction would remove A-&gt;C.</p>
<p>This sounded like exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I looked around for some sample code that implemented this algorithm, but didn’t find anything so I went to the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d0be/1e20643e7e15bd4669f1c3ef0c2287852566.pdf">original paper</a> published in 1972. Sidenote: The first author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Aho">Alfred Aho</a> is also the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">“dragon” book for compilers</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm">Aho-Corasick algorithm</a>!</p>
<p>The algorithm is fairly straight-forward. Here’s some psuedo code that implements the algorithm as written:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, this algorithm was actually <em>slower</em> than my initial solution! On average it took about 5 extra seconds.</p>
<p>Since the matrix multiplication has a runtime complexity of O(n^3), I felt that is where the bulk of the time was being spent. If I could find a way to speed up the matrix multiplication, I might be able to speed up the overall algorithm significantly.</p>
<p>I considered trying to read up on research on matrix multiplication math. I wondered if there were optimizations for Boolean matrices, or for the case where you try to square a matrix. I was just about to start researching those topics, when I was struck with an idea: What if the matrix multiplication was slow because I was just using a poor implementation?</p>
<p>I remembered that there is a framework available on macOS called <code>Accelerate</code> that provides fast implementations for vector math. In that past, I have used it to compute the FFT of audio/image data. Maybe it had functions for matrix multiplication too.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3-accelerated-transitive-reduction">Approach 3: “Accelerated” Transitive Reduction</h2>
<p>I searched through the API of <code>Accelerate</code> and found a matrix multiplication function: <code>vDSP_mmul</code>. It only works for <code>Float</code>s, but I thought I could make it work.</p>
<p>Instead of refactoring my code to use <code>Float</code> matrices, I decided to try replacing the implementation of <code>multiply(m1:, m2:)</code> with <code>vDSP_mmul</code> by converting my <code>Bool</code> matrices to/from <code>Float</code> matrices as needed. If using <code>vDSP_mmul</code> didn’t significantly speed up the matrix multiplication, there was no point optimizing other parts of the code.</p>
<p>Here is the rough approach I took:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert each <code>Bool</code> matrix into a linear <code>Float</code> array. True = 1.0, and False = 0.0</li>
<li>Use <code>Accelerate</code> to do matrix multiplication on these <code>Float</code> arrays.</li>
<li>Convert the output <code>Float</code> array back into a <code>Bool</code> matrix</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is some pseudo code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>func</span> <span>multiplyFast</span><span>(</span><span>m1</span><span>:</span> <span>[[</span><span>Bool</span><span>]],</span> <span>m2</span><span>:</span> <span>[[</span><span>Bool</span><span>]])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[[</span><span>Bool</span><span>]]</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This time, the algorithm ran <strong>much</strong> faster. For 400 elements, it took &lt;1 second to complete!</p>
<p>I was so surprised by this result, that I assumed I must have a bug somewhere. I spent a bunch of time validating that there were no bugs, and that the result of this approach were equivalent to the result of approach 1. Fortunately there were no bugs I could find. <code>Accelerate</code> is just insanely fast!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started out on this project just trying to draw some cool graphs in Graphviz. I ended up learning some graph theory, and using a vector processing framework called Accelerate to make my algorithm fast.</p>
<p>The graphs I was trying to make are called <em>Hasse Diagrams</em> and creating them requires computing the <em>transitive reduction</em> over a list of <em>partially ordered</em> elements. The standard algorithm for the transitive reduction has a runtime complexity of O(n^3). This produces a very slow run time with a naive implementation, but can be sped up significantly using a vector processing framework like <code>Accelerate</code>.</p>

September 6, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/01/slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast-25-of-our-time-refactoring/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/01/slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast-25-of-our-time-refactoring/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

                                Tuesday September 01, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/tuukka-turunen">Tuukka Turunen</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong><em><span>We are super-excited that a significant milestone, the feature freeze of the next major version of Qt, has been reached! We now have the functionality in place, and the following months will be spent in polishing and tuning the release. Target is to complete the maturation phase in the coming months to be able to release Qt 6.0.0 in December.</span></em></strong></p>
<!--more--><p><span>Over the past few years, we have been working to research, plan, and create the next Qt version. Qt 5 has been a great success, and it is a solid foundation for the development of applications and devices still for many years to come. But the world is changing, so we are introducing a version that takes Qt users into the new decade. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Qt 6 technical vision blog post by Lars</a> offers a great overview of Qt 6.0 future strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Qt 6.0 Timeline</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are already multiple separate blog posts regarding the features and functionality of Qt 6, and there are also many more to come. Therefore, in this post, I am focusing on the structure, and timeline of Qt 6.0. </span></p>
<p><span>First, let’s review the major milestones of the Qt 6.0 development schedule:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>January 2020: Qt 5.15 branched, development branch becomes Qt 6.0, merge of the feature branches</span></li>
<li><span>June 2020: Structural freeze, supported modules and platforms defined, first binary snapshot released</span></li>
<li><span>August 2020: Feature freeze, all functionality completed </span></li>
<li><span>September 2020: Alpha release</span></li>
<li><span>October 2020: Beta phase starts, multiple beta snapshot releases</span></li>
<li><span>November 2020: Release Candidate</span></li>
<li><span>December 2020: Qt 6.0.0 Release</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With the feature freeze milestone now reached, next milestone is the Alpha release. This is still quite a lot geared for those participating development of Qt itself as well those who want to closely follow how Qt 6.0 is shaping up. The Beta releases are what we hope all Qt users take a look and provide feedback. During the Beta phase they key goal is to address as much as possible the issues hindering using Qt 6.0 – so the feedback from all Qt users is very important. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Qt 6.0 Supported Platforms and Modules</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For Qt 6.0, our focus is on the essential modules as well as a few selected add-ons. As always, with a new major release, we also do not have all the upcoming target configurations yet supported. After Qt 6.0, our goal is to release Qt 6.1, Qt 6.2 LTS, as well as multiple patch releases during 2021. These releases will provide support for additional add-on modules and target configurations. </span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6.0 supports the following modules:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Qt Core</span></li>
<li><span>Qt GUI</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Widgets</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Network</span></li>
<li><span>Qt QML</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick Controls</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick 3D</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Shader Tools</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Quick Timeline</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Wayland</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Wayland Compositor</span></li>
<li><span>Qt SVG</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Concurrent</span></li>
<li><span>Qt D-Bus</span></li>
<li><span>Qt OpenGL and Qt OpenGL Widgets (note different than in Qt 5)</span></li>
<li><span>Qt 3D</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Network Authorization</span></li>
<li><span>Qt SQL</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Printing Support</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Test</span></li>
<li><span>Qt Help</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>…and a few other ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Within the modules, some old APIs have been removed, and new APIs have been introduced. &nbsp;In case where the functionality is removed on purpose (deprecated in Qt 5.15), the application may need to be modified accordingly and we will prepare a migration guide to assist you. </span></p>
<p><span>Some modules that are present in Qt 5 are not listed above because:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>They are purposely removed (like Qt Script and Qt XML Patterns)</span></li>
<li><span>The functionality is part of other modules, so it is no longer needed as a separate module (like platform specific extras) </span></li>
<li><span>We plan to add those in later Qt 6.x feature releases (like Qt Multimedia, Qt Bluetooth and Qt Virtual Keyboard).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If your application depends upon functionality missing from Qt 6.0, it may be need to wait until a Qt 6.x release provides it. As an long term support release, Qt 5.15 LTS serves this use-case specifically, keeping your project maintained with new patch releases. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6.0 supports the majority of all desktop, mobile and embedded platforms. Due to our C++17 requirement, a up-to-date compiler is essential. Support for real-time operating systems, is planned to be on a ‘technology preview’ level, i.e. development and testing is possible. We’ll provide a more detailed roadmap for supported hosts and targets with the upcoming alpha and beta releases. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How can I try Qt 6.0?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We are developing Qt 6.0 together with the whole Qt community. The source code repositories are available, and everyone can join the development via the Qt Project. We have released regular snapshots of Qt 6.0 since June and continue towards the final. With the feature freeze now in place and Alpha approaching, the snapshots improve the usability for trying Qt 6.0. During the Beta phase, we hope that most of you will try out the snapshots, and provide us with feedback. </span></p>
<p><span>The Qt 6.0 snapshots are available via the Qt online installer. All you have to do is to enable the ‘Preview’ category. To gain access to the source code, simply clone from the Qt Project repositories – or use the source code packages that are available as part of the Qt 6.0 snapshot releases.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>I was recently reading through an appendix on Jacques Lacan’s <em>Seminar on “The Purloined Letter”</em> and was surpised to find a discussion of a problem that seemed to fundamentally be a programming exercise. These notes are the result of some exploration I did implementing Lacan’s discussion in the <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket Programming language</a> (a modern dialect of the Scheme programming language for those unfamiliar). This seemed to be quite a perfect fit since Lacan’s primary interest is in the role that “signifiers” play in our understanding of the world and Racket is a <em>symbolic</em> programming language that focuses on the manipulation of symbols to perform computation. The full code and original markdown for these notes can be found in <a href="https://github.com/willkurt/lacan-racket">this github repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-intro-to-lacan">A quick intro to Lacan</h2>
<p>Jacques Lacan’s <a href="https://www.lacan.com/purloined.htm"><em>Seminar on “The Purloined Letter”</em></a> * is a lecture that covers many of Lacan’s essential themes and is a great introduction to understanding the basics of Lacanian psychology. When abstracted out, many of Lacan’s ideas can be reasonably straightforward, however in the original context Lacan takes the audiences on a splendid journey through his thinking that, for the uninitiated, can be a bit confusing. There is an appendix to this Seminar a surprisingly quantitative and technical section in this lecture as printed in <em>Écrits</em> under the subsection titled <em>Introduction</em> which in fact follows after the transcript of the seminar.</p>
<p>* <em>note</em>: that link does not contain the full appendix that is discussed in these notes.</p>
<p>This Seminar focuses on a classic Edgar Allen Poe text, <a href="https://poestories.com/read/purloined">“The Purloined Letter”</a> which is a mystery centering on a stolen letter. Lacan uses this letter as classic example of the ‘primacy of the signified’. “What in the world does that mean!?” you might reasonably ask. Lacan was particularly interested in the different roles that the “signifier” and the “signified” play in our understanding of the world. In general we can think of the <em>signifier</em> as the “thing which points to something else” and the <em>signified</em> as the “thing pointed at”. Take for example this image:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://willkurt.github.io/lacan-racket/images/cat_ecrits.png" width="300" alt=""><figcaption>“A cat reading Lacan’s Écrits”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We would say that there is a “cat” in this image. The word “cat” would be the signifier and the cat itself would be the signified. Typically we tend to think of the <em>signfied</em> at the real thing, but Lacan was interested in how incredibly important the signfier itself is in our understanding of the world. He proclaims in the Seminar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I teach that the unconscious is the fact that man is inhabited by the signifier”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original Poe story is about a stolen letter and a detectives quest to return the letter. Lacan uses this stolen letter an example of the power of the signifier. Even though the entire story is driven by this letter the reader never knows what the actual contents of the letter are. Lacan points out that not only do we not know, we don’t need to. The letter itself as a signifier is able to create all the drama and complexity this mystery needs.</p>
<h3 id="the-primacy-of-the-signifier">The primacy of the signifier</h3>
<p>For Lacan it is these signifiers, these symbols of things, that are in fact the reality of our unconcious life. That is we operate primarily in terms of symbols, not the least of which is language itself. As an example of the role these signifigers play, consider a statement such as “I am a male technologist”. It turns out there in a emoji specifically for this very idea:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://willkurt.github.io/lacan-racket/images/man_technologist.png" width="300" alt=""><figcaption>“Emoji are a great representation of the signifier”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now when I say “male technologist” you likely have a pretty good idea what I mean, but if we pick apart what these words mean we quickly find it is very tricky to point to what exactly I am signifying. For starters what does it mean to say that I am “male”? We can see this as expression of biological sex, but it also entrails notions of gender. What does it mean to be a “man”? You might be tempted to quickly make some statement about the number of X choromosomes, but even if that works for one technical definition of “male” it clearly doesn’t do enough to explain it in all or even most social occasions. The more we explore “maleness” the more we realize that being “male” is more a signifier that a signified, it is like an emoji that we can’t quite pin down exactly what it points to.</p>
<p>This is of course just one tiny example of how often times the signifier is what plays a primal role in our way of interacting with the world. Lacan also points out that there is one very important signifier in our contemporary existence, which is always something with points to something else, and yet nonetheless plays an essential role in our psychology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the signifier that most thoroughly annihilates every signifcation–namely, money”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a bit more exposition on Lacan take a look at my talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_dqEgtpgBg">“The Limits of Probability”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lacan-and-racket">Lacan and Racket</h2>
<p>To demonstrate just how powerful pure symobls can be Lacan give an example of a very simple symbol language which nonetheless has some very interesting properities. Given that Racket is a programming language focused specifically on symbol manipulation I thought it would be a really fun exercise to implement this specific example fo Lacan’s reasoning in Racket!</p>
<p>Racket is in the family of Lisp programming languages. One dominant feature of most Lisp dialects is that they focus on the programmer performing computation strictly through symbol manipulation. The allows the programmer to treat even programs themselves as inputs to other programs, which leads to some very powerful programming abstractions.</p>
<p>Given that Racket is one of the best examples of a contemporary symbolic programming language this is a great tool to explore in more detail the problem that Lacan is discussion. Implementing Lacan in Racket also makes is arguments much more clear and can help make some logic easier to reason about.</p>
<h3 id="freud-the-death-drive-and-the-repetition-compulsion">Freud, the death drive and the repetition compulsion</h3>
<p>Lacan starts what is essential an appendix to the Seminar by discussing Freud’s controversial writing <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em>. In this text Freud struggles with the question of the <em>repetition compulsion</em> (or automatism) in which patients repeatedly return to thinking about tramautic events in their lifes. Freud typically explains most of our behavior in terms libidinal desires, that is pleasure seeking, sexual urges. For Freud most of the complexity of human psychology is the way we resist these desires as part of our everyday lifes. The trouble is that if our behavior is driven exclusively by a pleasure instinct why would anyone be compelled to revisit painful experiences over and over again? Freud’s theoretical solution to this problem is the establishment of the idea of the ‘death drive’. Freud argues that human behavior is in fact driven by the conflict between our libido and this death drive (Eros and Thanatos). Understandably even Freud’s most ardent followers found this explaination a little difficult to digest.</p>
<h3 id="repition-compulsion-explained-through-the-symbolic-chain">Repition compulsion explained through the symbolic chain</h3>
<p>Lacan’s response is that while Freud’s solution is easily dismissed, the problem he describes does need some exploration. Lacan argues that the <em>autonomy of the symbolic</em> is enough to explain the repetition compulsion. What in the world is the “autonomy of the symbolic?” Lacan wants to show us that mere symbols and rules for creating those symbols can contain their own logic which can cause repitition without needing to refer to any more complicated system. From a standpoint of modern programming this is not at all surprising. Anyone who has writen a program has basically used symbols that have no intrinsic meaning and used the logic of these symobls create predictable behavior. This is why this is a particularly fun part of Lacan to implement in code!</p>
<p>To demonstrate this Lacan develops a very simple grammar from symobic manipulation to demonstrate the emergent rules that come from this. For Lacan this shows that we don’t need complex ideas like the death drive to explain the compulsion to repeat: symbols themselves can cause this. Lacan starts with two symbols + and - representing, abstractly, presents or absence respectively. In Racket we can represent a list of these symbosl likes this:</p>
<pre><code>'( + + - + + - - - +)</code></pre>
<p>He then creates some simple rules that can can be used to transform a sequence of three of these symbols into three new symbols <code>'(1 2 3)</code>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate Lacan’s rules we’ll implement series of racket functions that check whether or not a given string of <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> maps to the target symbol. Lacan, being Lacan, expresses these symbols in a more indirect way, but the following definitions will suffice to show Lacan’s larger point.</p>
<p>The symbol 1 is defined as either <code>+++</code> or <code>---</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-one? xs)
  (or (equal? xs '(+ + +))
      (equal? xs '(- - -))))
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol 2 can be <code>+--</code>, <code>-++</code>, <code>++-</code>, <code>--+</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-two? xs)
  (or (equal? xs '(+ - -))
      (equal? xs '(- + +))
      (equal? xs '(+ + -))
      (equal? xs '(- - +))))</code></pre>
<p>And the symbol 3 is <code>+-+</code> or <code>-+-</code></p>
<pre><code>(define (is-three? xs)
   (or (equal? xs '(+ - +))
       (equal? xs '(- + -))))</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to imagine a string of these <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> base representations and how they would be translated. To be clear, if we have 3 {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} symbols we can generate a single <code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> symbol, and if we have four {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} we can generate two symbols. To make this more clear (and allow you to play with this process) we will demonstrate this in Racket. Our encoder takes the list in 3 at a time and then generates new symbols from the set {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>, <code>3</code>} based on the rules we have. In racket we have implemented a function named <code>encode-1-3</code> which takes a {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} representation and encodes it as a 1-3 symbol representation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + +))
'(1)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + -))
'(1 2)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + - -))
'(1 2 2)
&gt; (encode-1-3 '(+ + + - - -))
'(1 2 2 1)
&gt; </code></pre>
<p>At this point it’s worth noting that every string of {<code>+</code>,<code>-</code>} symbols can be encoded in exactly one sequence of {<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>3</code>} symbols. Something interesting happens when we try to go the other way. Just looking at our original symbol definitions we know …</p></div>

Their goal&nbsp;is to solve important brain and spine problems with a seamlessly implanted device. The first application for Neuralink's Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) is focused on&nbsp;improving&nbsp;the lives of&nbsp;patients living with severe neural conditions and disorders. The company&nbsp;has&nbsp;ambitious plans to scale their&nbsp;technology by making it&nbsp;highly accessible, minimally invasive, and low risk, akin to a simple elective procedure like <span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774" target="_blank" data-content="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774" data-type="external" rel="noopener">LASIK&nbsp;Eye surgery</a></span>.</p>



<p>Having&nbsp;developed&nbsp;design systems&nbsp;for emerging medical devices entering&nbsp;clinical trials and commercial launch, I&nbsp;decided to take a brief look at how patients may one day experience Neuralink. The near-term value proposition of Neuralink hinges on a new type of experience for patients living with neurological challenges. Developing&nbsp;the human journey in parallel with this novel&nbsp;technology is&nbsp;critical in order to ensure a meaningful patient-centered experience.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>I've broken down the experience into two parts:</p>

<p><span>​</span>​</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Guiding principles&nbsp;– values that&nbsp;guide the design of the human&nbsp;experience</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Patient journey – what the patient is thinking, feeling, and doing&nbsp;as a lifelong Neuralink user</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>The concepts and ideas in this post are a working hypothesis based on publicly available information&nbsp;about Neuralink (e.g.,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-vbh3t7WVI" target="_blank" data-content="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-vbh3t7WVI" data-type="external" rel="noopener">2019&nbsp;launch,</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVvmgjBL74w&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" data-content="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVvmgjBL74w&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-type="external" rel="noopener">2020 update</a></span>). The goal here isn't to be "right", but to imagine possibilities for the broader service&nbsp; offering and design system. Creating meaningful and human-centered experiences will require&nbsp;patients and other stakeholders like healthcare providers&nbsp;to be actively engaged in co-creating, testing, and iterating upon the journey.</p>



<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>NEURALINK SYSTEM</span></p>

<p>Before diving&nbsp;into the Neuralink guiding&nbsp;principles and journey, I've made some key assumptions about what I am calling the&nbsp;"Neuralink&nbsp;System". There are two&nbsp;interrelated parts of&nbsp;this system: the Neuralink (1)&nbsp;Chip&nbsp;and (2)&nbsp;App. Both technologies&nbsp;can be upgraded and replaced as hardware/software evolves. Together, these&nbsp;components enable a person to record and translate signals between their brain and the external world.</p></div><div title="" data-is-responsive="false" data-display-mode="fill" data-content-padding-horizontal="0" data-content-padding-vertical="0" data-exact-height="572" id="comp-kek3jsq3"><div id="comp-kek3jsq3link"><wix-image data-has-bg-scroll-effect="" data-image-info="{&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;dataItem-kek3jsv6&quot;,&quot;metaData&quot;:{&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;v6g2c&quot;,&quot;isPreset&quot;:false,&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;isHidden&quot;:false},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;03eae2_158529a781ed458f98498866dee11fb5~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:2107,&quot;height&quot;:1598,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;neuralinksystem.png&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;neuralinksystem.png&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;},&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kek3jsq3&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" id="comp-kek3jsq3img"><img id="comp-kek3jsq3imgimage" alt="neuralinksystem.png" data-type="image" itemprop="image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/03eae2_158529a781ed458f98498866dee11fb5~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_226,h_172,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/neuralinksystem.png"></wix-image></div></div><div data-packed="false" data-vertical-text="false" data-min-height="94" id="comp-ke9a8ery"><p><span>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</span></p>

<p>The proposed guiding principles shall shape&nbsp;and&nbsp;inform the design of the Neuralink&nbsp;patient experience:</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>Safety</span></p>

<p>Human health, safety and wellbeing&nbsp;come&nbsp;first</p>



<p><span>Longevity</span></p>

<p><span>Impact</span></p>

<p>Practical&nbsp;day-to-day needs are addressed</p>



<p><span>Seamless</span></p>

<p>Naturally integrated into people’s lives</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>Empowerment</span></p>

<p>Patients gain&nbsp;greater control over their lives and reach their full potential</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>PATIENT JOURNEY MAP</p>

<p>The patient journey map below&nbsp;is relatively self explanatory (click image to view PDF). The journey envisions a future experience where Neuralink is in its second or third generation of technology:&nbsp;The surgical procedure is a half-day event&nbsp;conducted by a robotic surgeon, and the&nbsp;patient uses the&nbsp;Neuralink&nbsp;system on a daily basis. The App is also an integral part of the end-to-end experience -- it&nbsp;facilitates and guides the user experience, from the moment&nbsp;that the patient decides to get the surgery to when they start using&nbsp;the Neuralink&nbsp;system in their everyday life.</p>

<p>Conducting research with prospective and actual patients and healthcare providers will support the development of a robust patient journey and collateral (e.g., instructional material, marketing assets), and can help Neuralink&nbsp;develop the ideal user&nbsp;experience. Doing so will bring this work to the next level.</p>

TypeScript’s purpose <em>is </em>to be compiled into JavaScript. There is more, perhaps to add to the confusion: JavaScript itself is valid TypeScript because <strong>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. </strong>You can simply change your <code>js</code> or <code>jsx</code> file to <code>ts</code> or <code>tsx</code> and congratulations! You’re writing in TypeScript.</p><p>If you understand the relationship between CSS and Sass, for example, you have a sense for what this means.</p><p>TypeScript was developed by Microsoft as an open source project in 2012. It offers a wealth of features that JavaScript does not offer. One of the most powerful features TypeScript has is robust ways of working with object types. TypeScript throws specific errors to help you debug. TypeScript also compiles into older versions of JavaScript, which allows your applications to be accessible by many browsers.</p><p>If you are not comfortable with JavaScript itself, I recommend learning JavaScript before diving into TypeScript.

We really like TypeScript for allowing us to focus on the main problem we’re solving and not on typs in an object’s property name. In TypeScript programs, the chances of getting runtime errors are substantially lower compared to code originally written in JavaScript. We also like that IDEs offer great TypeScript support and literally walk us through the maze of APIs from third-party libraries we use in projects.</p><p>— <em>TypeScript Quickly</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599373915601_4321"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617295949/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1617295949&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=5b0d81d5d6efb533b956d8ffbb961096"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1617295949&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1617295949" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599373915601_4388"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/359fxGV" target="_blank"><em>TypeScript Quickly</em></a><em> </em>by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev is a February 2020 Manning publication that is one of the most well-organized, clear, and practical books I have seen on TypeScript. Every chapter is clear and concise, and you know where you are going every step of the way.</p><p>This book is all about helping you become a more productive developer on web or standalone apps. The authors are practitioners, writing for practitioners — so the book outlines the process of building multiple apps using TypeScript and other popular libraries and frameworks. The book assumes knowledge in HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript already.</p><p>A challenge of teaching TypeScript is that TypeScript often doesn’t function alone. The language is often paired with another frontend framework like React or Angular. Like with other books, <em>TypeScript Quickly </em>decides to be opinionated by diving into frameworks as well.</p><p>As far as organization goes, <em>TypeScript Quickly </em>is one of the best. Its structure is clean and you know exactly what you are getting into every step of the way.</p><p><em>TypeScript Quickly </em>includes the following sections:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Part 1: Mastering the TypeScript syntax</strong>, which includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Chapter 1: Getting familiar with TypeScript</strong>, which includes the benefits of programming in TypeScript, Typescript vs JavaScript, how to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript, and how to work with the Visual Studio Code editor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 2: Basic and custom types, </strong>which includes declaring variables with types and using types in function declarations, declaring type aliases with the type keyword, and declaring custom types with classes and interfaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 3: Object-oriented programming with classes and interfaces</strong>, which includes how class inheritance works, why and when to use abstract classes, how interfaces can force a class to have methods with known signatures without worry about implementation details, and what programming to interfaces means.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 4: Using enums and generics, </strong>which includes the benefits of using enums, the syntax for numeric and string enums, what generic types are for, and how to write classes, interfaces, and functions that support generics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 5: Decorators and advanced types</strong>, which includes what the TypeScript decorators are for, how to create a new type based on an existing one using mapped types, how conditional types work, and combining mapped and conditional types.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 6: Tooling</strong>, which includes debugging TypeScript code with the help of source maps, the role of linters, compiling and bundling TypeScript apps with Webpack, compiling TypeScript apps with Babel, and how to compile TypeScript with Babel and bundle it with Webpack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 7: Using TypeScript and JavaScript in the same project</strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Part 2: Applying TypeScript in a blockchain app</strong>, which includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Chapter 8: Developing your own blockchain app</strong>, which includes the principles of blockchain apps, what the hashing functions are for, what block mining is, and developing a simple blockchain-based app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 9: Developing a browser-based blockchain node, </strong>which includes creating a web client for a blockchain, creating a small library for hash generation, and running ther blockchain web app and debugging TypeScript in the browser.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 10: Client-server communications using Node.js, TypeScript,a nd WebSockets</strong>, which includes why a blockchain may need a server, the longest chain rule, how to create a Node.js WebSocket server in TypeScript, and poractical uses of TypeScript interfaces, abstract classes, access qualifiers, enums, and generics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 11: Developing Angular apps with TypeScript</strong>, which includes a quick intro to the Angular framework, how to generate, build, and serve a web app written in Angular and TypeScript, and how Angular implements dependency injection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 12: Developing the blockchain client in Angular</strong>, which includes reviewing the code of the blockchain web client in Angular and how to run an Angular client that communicates with a WebSocket server.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 13: Devleoping React.js apps with TypeScript</strong>, which includes a quick intro to the React.js library, how React components use props and state, and how React components communicate with each other. </p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 14: Developing a blockchain client in React.js</strong>, which includes reviewing a blockchain web client written with React.js, how the React.js web client communicates with the WebSocket server, running a React app that works with two servers in dev mode, and splitting the UI of a blockchain client into components and arranging their communications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 15: Developing Vue.js apps with TypeScript</strong>, which includes a quick introduction to the Vue.js framework, how to …</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

ULA kicked the weekend off with a Delta IV Heavy launch of an NRO spy satellite. The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission. You just can’t get ahead. </em>🤷‍♂️)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#etc">¶</a><strong id="etc">Etc.</strong></p><ul><li>Explore Mars has <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/H2MR_2020_Web_v1.pdf" target="_blank">released their annual Humans to Mars report</a> detailing progress towards human exploration of the planet in the 2030s.</li><li>The US Department of Education has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/" target="_blank">announced a CubeSat mission design and prototyping challenge for High School students</a>.

        Recently I stumbled upon <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf">an interesting paper</a> for
        implementing motion sensing requiring no special hardware, <i>only a speaker and mic</i>! Unfortunately the paper didn't include
        code to test it, so I decided to reproduce it here on the web!
      </p>

      <h2>What is the doppler effect?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, what is the doppler effect?
        The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">doppler effect</a> is a physical phenomenom which affects waves in motion.
        The standard example is the effect on a fire engine siren as it quickly drives
        past. When it moves <i>towards</i> you the sound waves are compressed, and so the
        frequency becomes <i>higher</i>, and
        when it moves <i>away</i> from you the frequency becomes <i>lower</i>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This phenomenon actually has really wonderful applications in astronomy for figuring the speed
        at which galaxies are moving towards or away from us by looking at the frequency shift of light,
        but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, it's important to realize that the doppler effect would also occur
        if you were to run towards the siren, rather than the siren moving towards you.
        We'll use this principle in the next section.
      </p>

      <h2>Measuring the doppler effect</h2>
      <p>
        In order to measure the doppler effect for motion detection on a conventional computer,
        what you can do is send out a sinusoid at some known (inaudible) frequency, say, 20 kHz.
        If something is moving in the room, then, after the sinusoid has bounced around on the walls and into the microphone, the
        sound will shift in frequency. This can be measured by looking at the frequency spectrum
        in the nearby region of the 20 kHz tone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Note that you'll need to run Chrome with a fairly high speaker-volume for this to work optimally.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The frequency spectrum of the microphone input is plotted above. The peak towards the right
        is due to the 20 kHz tone we're sending out. Try <span data-note="440">whistling</span> to see the spectrum change.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here's a closer look, zooming in on the 20 kHz region.
        Try moving your hand <i>towards</i>
        the mic/computer to see the bulge shift to <i>higher</i> frequencies, and
        <i>away</i> from the computer to see it shift to <i>lower</i> frequencies.
      </p>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Now for the fun applications!
      </p>

      <h3>Motion sensing</h3>
      <p>
        The most obvious application for this is motion sensing.
        Below I've calculated the left and right bandwidth of the 20 kHz
        region (defined as the number of frequencies to the left and right
        that are within 99.9% in amplitude of the 20 kHz tone).
        I've then attached their difference to the size of the box.
      </p>
      <canvas id="ball" width="700" height="100"></canvas>
      <p>
        The effect this produces is that when you move your hand <i>towards</i>
        the microphone, the box becomes smaller (you're <i>pushing</i>
        it inwards), and if you move your hand <i>away</i> from the microphone,
        the box becomes larger (you're <i>pulling</i> it outwards).
      </p>

      <h3>Scrolling</h3>
      
      <p>
        A cool application to motion sensing, as suggested by the
        <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf">SoundWave paper</a>,
        is scrolling (see the video above). Click below to try it out.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This implementation doesn't have the double-tap feature for reversing
        the scrolling-direction, instead it's just using the left and right bandwidth-difference.
        Thus if you want to scroll down you have to move your hand
        <i>quickly towards</i> the computer, and <i>slowly away</i> from the computer.
      </p>

      <h3>Theremin</h3>
      
      <p>
        We can also create an instrument with this by simply modulating
        the frequency of some base-tone, say at 440 Hz, based on the
        difference between the left and right bandwidth!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is reminiscent of a Theremin, in that you can contol
        sound by moving your hands in free space, yet different
        in that the Theremin is able to measure absolute distance from the base,
        whereas we can only measure relative motion.
      </p>

      <h2>Library</h2>
      <p>
        Did this give you any ideas? I also created <a href="https://github.com/DanielRapp/doppler">a small library</a> to play around with this.
        Just run
      </p>
        <pre><code>
  doppler.init(function(bandwidth) {
    var diff = bandwidth.left - bandwidth.right;
  });
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        to start experimenting.
      </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span>Estimated reading time:</span> <span>3</span> <span>Minutes</span></p><p>I’ll start this blog post with a funny story: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dev.bitolog.com/kubernetes-audits-introduction/" target="_blank">my last blog post</a> was an introduction to Kubernetes audits (which I recommend reading before diving into this post). As a continuing post, I wrote about what I thought to be the future of Kubernetes audits – <strong>the dynamic backend</strong>. Only to find out, a couple of days before publishing my post, that the dynamic backend (also known as the <code>AuditSink</code> API object)  was entirely removed.</p><div><figure><img width="453" height="108" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png 453w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1.png 453w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-draft-1-300x72.png 300w"></figure></div><h2>What was it?</h2><p>The dynamic backend, first introduced in Kubernetes v1.13, was a third audit backend option. The first two being logging to a file and sending logs to a webhook – both defined via API server flags.</p><p>On the other hand, the dynamic backend introduced the ability to define a webhook endpoint dynamically. All you had to do is post the <code>AuditSink</code> object to the API server and you’re done. You could have also modify it at any point in time which was really cool!</p><p>The dynamic backend was a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes <em>alpha</em> feature</a>. The statistics regarding how many Kubernetes features eventually get discarded are unknown to me, but I can guess that this doesn’t happen often. This feature didn’t make it to GA (General Availability), and for me, at a very funny timing.</p><h2>Why was it removed?</h2><p>A few days ago, I got a notification from GitHub which stated that the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamic backend feature</a> has been closed, and will be removed in Kubernetes V1.19.</p><div><figure><img width="291" height="104" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-removed.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/auditsink-removed.png"></figure></div><p>I asked around the Kubernetes slack channel to understand what happened, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-auth/c/aV_nXpa5uWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the explanation I got</a>:</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the feature did not progress for the last 1.5 years since the group responsible for it couldn’t agree on it’s future.</p><div><figure><img src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png" alt="" width="580" height="217" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png 840w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-300x113.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-768x288.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig.png 840w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-300x113.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dynamic-audit-sig-768x288.png 768w"></figure></div><p>As you can see the removal of this feature happened for two main reasons:</p><ol><li>The logging and webhook backends both use a static policy file. It is supplied, as mentioned above, via an API server flag. As opposed to them, the dynamic backend policy was dynamic. The team leaders tried to understand what was the right approach to implement this but couldn’t reach an agreement. At the time, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/600#issuecomment-447636134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I also struggled to understand how will that feature work exactly</a>.</li><li>Performance and scalability issues were very common when using this feature. I noted it several times when writing my original post. Part of the issue here was that the policy wasn’t fine grained as it is for the other backends. This caused a lot of performance issue. I guess that behind the scenes this was a lot more complex.</li></ol><p>And that was that.</p><p>I guess that’s the price you pay when trying to cover the most recent developments in the cloud world.</p></div></div>]]>

Here is a clip of South American football -</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UioCvLN-370" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>But, what you <strong>also might have noticed is the noise of the crowd</strong> - all those fans screaming, cheering, hooting for their teams, and booing at the opposing teams.</p><p>This is what constitutes a home-ground advantage, right? Having a boisterous crowd yelling at the top of their voices and intimidating the opposition! It’s an integral part of large sporting events and is one reason people pay a lot of money to watch sports.</p><p>The right atmosphere counts!</p><h2 id="crowds-during-a-pandemic">Crowds during a pandemic?</h2><p>But, where are the crowds in a pandemic-stricken world? Leagues across Europe are making their way back with strict rules and regulations to prevent players and support staff from contracting and spreading the contagious COVID-19 virus.</p><p>Players apparently don’t shake hands, their change rooms are sanitized before and after matches, and the most significant change of them all - there are no crowds! Games will be played behind “closed doors” without any crowds and with minimal support and ground staff.</p><p>An inadvertent consequence of this decision is <strong>the absence of crowd noises</strong>. Imagine this for a minute -</p><blockquote><p>You have two teams battling it out on the field, the camera crew is capturing the event, and your audience is watching the live stream …. but without the crowd’s noise.</p></blockquote><p><strong>In other words, a terrible experience.</strong></p><h2 id="augmented-audio--fake-noise">Augmented Audio / Fake Noise</h2><p>DAZN is trying to add “augmented audio” for the Bundesliga matches and has created a Crowd-DJ position in their office!!</p><p>DAZN <a href="https://media.dazn.com/en/blog/2020/07/meet-the-bundesliga-crowd-dj/">said</a>, and I quote -</p><p><em>When the Bundesliga announced its return in early May, we immediately began exploring ways to create the most immersive experience for fans at home.</em></p><p><strong>When I read this, it sounded similar to</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/1/20676854/electric-cars-artificial-safety-noise-low-speeds-european-union-rules-2019-2021"><strong>car manufacturers trying to add some artificial noise to their electric vehicles because they were too silent</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p>So, what DAZN did was break down the problem of augmented audio into small pieces and tackle them one at a time. A brilliant move!</p><ul><li>DAZN first <strong>recorded an empty stadium’s ambient noise</strong>, which forms the absolute baseline upon which you would layer other noises.</li><li>They then extracted the noises made by t<strong>he crowds, the players and coaches</strong>, and instances of goals, fouls, yellow, and red cards from their digital archives of the past years.</li><li>DAZN mentions that they also created a <strong>5-min clip of the crowd devoid of chanting</strong> <strong>and sudden noises</strong> and looped that clip throughout the match. They discovered that anything less than 5 minutes would probably be discovered as fake noise! Very interesting indeed.</li></ul><p>After gathering these clips, they had to enlist the services of an engineer who played the role of a <strong>“Crowd DJ."</strong> The crowd DJ’s job was to mix the noises at the right times to recreate the feeling that the game is being played in front of an actual crowd.</p><h2 id="is-augmented-audio-the-way-forward">Is Augmented Audio the way forward?</h2><p>I think it is if this pandemic continues without any vaccines coming out soon. <strong>Apart from this, the learnings that will come out of such experiments are invaluable.</strong></p><h3 id="audio-latency-problems">Audio Latency Problems?</h3><p>There are issues that anyone venturing into fake-noise/augmented audio has to consider, and the prime among them (in my opinion) is <strong>“audio latency."</strong> I would say this is similar to lip-sync issues that are SO annoying, but, in the case of fake noise for sporting events, audio latency would kill the viewing experience.</p><p>For example, imagine the following just happened.</p><blockquote><p>1 min for the game to end, and Ronaldo has the ball. He is tearing down the field and kicks the ball, which curves prodigiously and misses the goal by mere inches.</p></blockquote><p>In a real match, the <strong>sighs</strong> and the “oooh” s from the crowd would occur almost immediately after the goal was missed. This would be followed by loud cheering from the opposition.</p><p>But, in augmented audio, <strong>either the crowd-DJ gets the timing right or misses it completely</strong>. If the crowd-DJ adds the <em>“ooohs” and the “boos”</em> 3 seconds after the ball went past the goal, the experience is probably going to be worse than Ronaldo missing the goal in the first place!</p><p><strong>Only time and experience will tell if augmented audio / fake-noise will be a mainstay in the sports broadcasting industry.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>If you’ve been following me over the last few months, you would most certainly know how many internet related issues I’ve been having since the start of 2020.</p>

<h2 id="if-not-lets-quickly-recap-from-the-very-beginning-of-our-internet-situation-at-home-in-south-africa">If not, let’s quickly recap from the very beginning of our internet situation at home in South Africa…</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1999</strong>: Get Dial Up for the first time. I think it was an <a href="https://www.mweb.co.za/">Mweb</a> Big Black Box or something like that. I was only allowed to use the internet between 7pm and 7am and weekends. I think calls were unlimited for R7 during those hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2007</strong>: Our area finally got ADSL. 384kbps, capped at 2gb per month. Considering now our daily usage is about 5-10gb, clearly streaming wasn’t big then.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2010</strong>: Upgrade to 4mbps ADSL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2013</strong>: Upgrade to 10mbps ADSL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2018</strong>: Copper cable theft started becoming extremely common. During one month, it got stolen about 6 times, leaving us offline almost the whole month. We had no choice but to switch over to a Fixed LTE network called Rain, via an ISP called Afrihost. It was a great switch (at the time). Wireless cannot get stolen. Fast too - constantly 20-30mbps, rarely experiencing any downtime. Capped at 220gb, but more than enough for our family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2020</strong>:  And then 2020 came along, where I would notice at certain times of the day it would drop to less than 1mbps at certain times of the day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/9064720593.png" alt="0.15Mbps speedtest result"></p>

<p>Contacted Afrihost customer support a few times, but they always blame it on the wifi even though we know for a fact it’s most certainly not the issue, as it only happens at certain times of the day and are always fine in the evenings.</p>

<p>Turns out the reason is the network highly congested - I was on a fixed capped LTE product, paying R1350 per month and then Rain secretly launched a new product, unlimited LTE between 11pm to 6pm (19 hours), at R250 per month. Instead of migrating me as a Fixed LTE user onto another network, perhaps with higher QoS, I suddenly shared this network with the hundreds on the cheap R250 network, which is why my speeds dropped so dramatically outside of 6pm and 11pm. The R250 guys get cut off after 6pm and 11pm and then I have the network all to myself basically - but still, I’m paying for a 24/7 service, it shouldn’t only be usable for 4 hours a day.</p>

<p>I eventually setup my little Linux server at home to perform a speed test every hour and save the results onto a DB. I then graphed out the results on a little React App that I called <a href="https://www.rainspeedtest.co.za/"><strong>Rain Speedtest</strong></a> - I even registered a domain for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.ronaldlangeveld.com/assets/images/rain_speedtest.png" alt="Rain Speedtest"></p>

<p>I ended up sharing this with some friends, customer support and on a few forums. To this day it still get a lot of traffic.</p>

<p>After sending the speedtest data to Rain and Afrihost, they eventually admitted the local LTE tower is extremely congested and there is nothing they can/will do about it. Afrihost eventually helped me out and sent me a new router + sim card for the MTN Network, the caveat is that it’s capped at 150gb, so now I have to be even more careful with data.</p>

<p>Although not a permanent solution as its capped, at least it gives me a stable connection, that doesn’t go as slow as Rain. It does sometime, become slow, but usually quite solid.</p>

<p>My permanent solution would be to get Fibre… After about 8 months and 100+ emails with multiple Fibre Network Operators, I finally got a company to install Fibre in our area. That will be my next blog post and how you can get that to happen if you don’t have FTTH in your neighbourhood yet.</p>

<p>To ensure <a href="https://github.com/synrg/dronefly" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/synrg/dronefly">Dronefly</a> always remains free, the Dronefly project has been relicensed under two copyleft licenses. <a href="https://github.com/synrg/dronefly/commit/89939bf2c418cb9d6d3c625b3598e30c16a0164b" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/synrg/dronefly/commit/89939bf2c418cb9d6d3c625b3598e30c16a0164b">Read the license change</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html">learn more about copyleft</a> at these links.</p>



<p>I was prompted to make this change after a recent incident in the <a href="https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot">Red DiscordBot</a> development community that made me reconsider my prior position that the liberal MIT license was best for our project. While on the face of it, making your license as liberal as possible might seem like the most generous and hassle-free way to license any project, I was shocked into the realization that its liberality was also its fatal flaw: all is well and good so long as everyone is being cooperative, but it does not afford any protection to developers or users should things suddenly go sideways in how a project is run. A copyleft license is the best way to avoid such issues.</p>



<p>In this incident – a sad story of conflict between developers I respect on both sides of the rift, and owe a debt to for what they’ve taught me – three cogs we had come to depend on suddenly stopped being viable for us to use due to changes to the license &amp; the code. Effectively, those cogs became unsupported and unsupportable. To avoid any such future disaster with the Dronefly project, I started shopping for a new license that would protect developers and users alike from similarly losing support, or losing control of their contributions. I owe thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dfloer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dfloer">Dale Floer</a>, a team member who early on advised me the AGPL might be a better fit, and later was helpful in selecting the doc license and encouraging me to follow through. We ran the new licenses by each contributor and arrived at this consensus: the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPL</a> is best suited for our server-based code, and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> is best suited for our documentation. The relicensing was made official this morning.</p>



<h2>On Discord platform alternatives</h2>



<p>You might well question what I, a Debian developer steeped in free software culture and otherwise in agreement with its principles, am doing encouraging a community to grow on the proprietary Discord platform! I have no satisfying answer to that. I explained when I <a href="https://syn.theti.ca/2020/02/16/introducing-dronefly-a-discord-bot-for-naturalists/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://syn.theti.ca/2020/02/16/introducing-dronefly-a-discord-bot-for-naturalists/">introduced my project here</a> some of the backstory, but that’s more of an account of its beginnings than justification for it to continue on this platform. Honestly, all I can offer is a rather dissatisfying <em>it seemed like the right thing to do at the time</em>.</p>



<p>Time will tell whether we could successfully move off of it to a freedom-respecting and privacy-respecting alternative chat platform that is both socially and technically viable to migrate to. That platform would ideally:</p>



<ul><li>not be under the control of a single, central commercial entity running proprietary code, so their privacy is safeguarded, and they are protected from disaster, should it become unattractive to remain on the platform;</li><li>have a vibrant and supportive open source third party extension development community;</li><li>support our image-rich content and effortless sharing of URLs with previews automatically provided from the page’s content (e.g. via OpenGraph tags);</li><li>be effortless to join regardless of what platform/device each user uses;</li><li>keep a history of messages so that future members joining the community can benefit from past conversations, and existing members can catch up on conversations they missed;</li><li>but above all else: <em>be acceptable and compelling to the existing community to move over onto it</em>.</li></ul>



<p>I’m intrigued by <a href="https://matrix.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> and wonder if it provides some or all of the above in its current form. Are you a developer writing bots for this platform? If so, I especially want to hear from you in the comments about your experience. Or in any case, if you’ve been there before – if you’ve faced the same issue with your community and have a success story to share, I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower.</p><p>This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower’s worth of good ideas a day, but I’d rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. Mostly, though, shower ideas are the incentive that keeps me smelling okay, so I grudgingly accept the constraint.</p><p>The time when it was most constraining was the first time I became a manager. I only had a few reports, so managing them wasn’t a full-time job. But I was very bad at it, and so it <em>should have</em> been what I spent all my shower insights on.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was spending my non-management time on programming. And even if I tried to use my showers to think about my thorny and awkward people issues, my mind somehow always wandered off to tackle those nice, juicy software design problems instead.</p><p>Management Attempt #1 didn’t go very well; being distracted by programming, I made lots of embarrassing mistakes that made my reports’ lives harder, which in turn made me feel stressed and guilty. I ended up bouncing back to being an individual contributor after a few months.</p><p>That experience of mine resonates strongly with Byrne Hobart’s <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/the-future-of-remote-work-is-not" target="_blank">observation about focus in knowledge work</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:</p><ol><li><p>&lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.</p></li><li><p>10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises.</p></li><li><p>50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>“50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html" target="_blank">the top idea in your mind</a>. It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It’s when you start habitually asking “how could this go faster?” It’s when you get <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html" target="_blank">relentlessly resourceful</a>. It’s around when you start <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">annoying your coworkers and/or significant other</a>, although that part is avoidable with practice.</p><p>Most importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.</p><p>I’ve found a few different strategies that help me with this:</p><h3 id="care-viscerally">Care viscerally</h3><p>It’s hard to recruit 50%+ of your brain to work on something just because you feel like you “should” do it. Your superego might listen to this newfangled “logic” and “reason” stuff, but the monkey-era parts of your brain can’t be fooled so easily. To be reliably able to focus on something, you need to be intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome.</p><p>For me, that’s not automatic—for instance, even though <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/work/">I’m incredibly excited about what Wave is doing</a>, my day-to-day motivation gets worse if I work remotely for too long without visiting our operations in Senegal. Unless I can periodically see for myself that people are using the things we’re building, it starts feeling a little bit fake, like the so-called “real world” is a simulation that I can only communicate with via Slack channels and <code>git push</code>.</p><h3 id="monotask">Monotask</h3><p>As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.</p><p>In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/#startups">faster compounding growth</a>.</p><h3 id="evade-obligations">Evade obligations</h3><p>As a manager, it became impossible to “only work on one thing:” there were too many small tasks and too many projects going on in parallel. But I have a similar principle: I can only have one <em>obligation to other people</em>. “Give advice on this project?” Whenever you want! “Review my 1,000-line change?” Only if review isn’t blocking you from shipping it. “Check in every so often to make sure this doesn’t go off the rails?” Sorry, I have to, uh, powder my nose. “Figure out what the process should be?” I’ll get back to you in a couple years. (The best process is no process, right?)</p><p>During Management Attempt #1, my programming project distracted me so much because other people cared a lot that I finished it—if I ever had to de-prioritize it, I would make those people sad. This made it take up my attention (by worrying about letting people down) even when I wasn’t working on it. Unfortunately, since management work comes in urgent bursts, I’d often end up in a situation where I had to delay either the programming or the management—i.e., choose between making two different sets of people sad—and in those cases it was very hard for me to control my focus.</p><p>Now that I’ve noticed this, I allow myself to contribute to multiple things in parallel, as long as they don’t tax my object permanence skills—if I totally forgot about this project today, would anything bad happen? As long as the answer is no (usually because someone else is the one taking initiative to move things forward), I can be pretty sure that project won’t try to colonize my brain in the shower.</p><h3 id="timebox-bullshit">Timebox bullshit</h3><p>Even if I have only one major project that other people depend on, I somehow always end up with a bunch of minor chores to do—responding to emails, deflecting secondary obligations, buying household necessities, powdering my nose, filing expense reports, etc.</p><p>For these, I employ a “bullshit timebox”—a one-hour period a few times a week when I do <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">all the things life is too short for</a>. During the remaining 165 hours per week, I do my resolute best not to think about any of the bullshit, no matter how much people bug me about whether a <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/03/03/my-tungsten-cube/" target="_blank">1.5” tungsten cube</a> is really a legitimate work expense.</p><p>In order for bullshit not to distract me for the rest of the week, I try to minimize my number of “open loops”—projects or processes that I’ve started but not completed. Much like how I single-task on programming until it’s done, I’ll make phone calls instead of email threads, or, God forbid, texts or instant messaging. It took a while for me to train my friends not to instant message me, but by now they remember my rants about how distracting it is, practically word-for-word.</p><hr><p>Management Attempt #2 didn’t go great for me either. But I finally did an okay job at Management Attempt #3. Part of this was because I avoided repeating the particular mistakes of Attempts #1 and #2. But part of it was that on Attempt #3, our engineering team grew quickly enough that I went from “no managing” straight to “full-time managing” with no transitional period in which to be distracted, screw up and be miserable.</p><p>Once I was full-time managing, I had no shiny distractions and was able to spend my showers focusing on how to be a better manager. And once I was 50%+ focused, well, I haven’t become a “superstar 10x manager” yet, but I quickly stopped being 0.1x.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>
through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<div>

That's it! The network is ready to learn.

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

    <p>Understanding OAuth2 and OpenID Connect</p>
    <br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>There seems to be a lot of confusion around <span>OAuth2</span> and <span>OpenID Connect</span>
        (<span>OIDC</span> for short). In this article, we will go on a journey to understand and clarify what
        OAuth2 and OIDC really are.</p>
      <p>Alice is hosting a party and wants to send an invite a select group of friends. She plans to send a digital invitation via
        a site called <span>KoolInvitez</span>. The site needs a list of emails to send out the invitation. Alice stores
        all her contacts (as a collection of groups) in a site called <span>EzGroupContacts</span>. How should Alice
        provide access to the group called 'CloseFriends' in EzGroupContacts to KoolInvitez to send the invites ??? Should Alice
        provide her credentials for EzGroupContacts to KoolInvitez so it can access the contacts in the group 'CloseFriends' ???
        This is a security <span>anti-pattern</span> and *<span>NOT</span>* recommended. This is
        where OAuth2 comes in handy. Think of OAuth2 as a way of handing someone a <span>Valet</span> key, who will
        have limited access to perform their task. In other words, OAuth2 is an open standard for users to grant access to their
        information on a site or application to another site, but without revealing their credentials.</p>
      <p>OIDC, on the other hand, is an extension on top of OAuth2, that is used to verify the identify of a user (authentication)
        in a standard way. As an example, there are many sites that do not have any user registration and rely on Google or Facebook
        for identity verification (authentication).</p>
    </div>
    <p>Before we go any further, let us define some terms that will be useful in the context of OAuth2 and OIDC as follows:</p>
    <table id="col2-table">
      <thead><tr>
        <th>Term</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Resource</span></td>
          <td>Data or information that a user owns (Ex: the contact list 'CloseFriends')</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Resource Owner</span></td>
          <td>The owner of a Resource (Ex: Alice)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Resource Server</span></td>
          <td>The server where the Resource is hosted (Ex: EzGroupContacts)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Client</span></td>
          <td>An application or a site that needs access to a user Resource (Ex: KoolInvitez)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Authorization Server</span></td>
          <td>The OAuth2/ODIC server where a user grants a consent to a Client, to access their Resource(s)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Access Token</span></td>
          <td>A security token which the Client can present to the Resource Server to get access to a user's
            Resource</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Front Channel</span></td>
          <td>Requests coming from a user agent (such as a web browser) to a server</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Back Channel</span></td>
          <td>Requests coming from a server to another server. This is done for security reasons</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The basic *<span>FUNDAMENTAL</span>* flow of OAuth2 is referred to as the <span>Autorization
        Code</span> flow and all the other flows are variations of this basic flow. The Auorization Code flow works as follows:</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>1</span> :: the Resource Owner launches the Client to initiate the flow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>2</span> :: the Client makes a request to the Authorization Server from the Front Channel for an
            authorization code (<span>/auth_code</span>) passing in an URL to respond back to (<span>/callback
            </span>) at the Client</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>3</span> :: the Authorization Server redirects the Resource Owner to the Resource Server for user
            authentication and access grant</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>4</span> :: the Resource Owner enters valid credentials that is verified by the Resource Server and
            redirects back to the Authorization Server</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>5</span> :: the Authorization Server generates an Authorization Code and responds back to the Client
            with the authorization code on the Back Channel at the specified URL (<span>/callback</span>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>6</span> :: the Client makes a request to the Authorization Server for an Access Token through the
            Back Channel</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>7</span> :: the Authorization Server responds back to the Client with an Access Token on the Back
            Channel</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>8</span> :: the Client uses the Access Token to make a request to access the Resource at the Resource
            Server</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>9</span> :: the Resource Server responds with the data associated with the Resource</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the basic Authorization Code flow:</p>

    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/oauth-01.png" alt="Basic Flow"></p><p>Figure.1</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><span>NOTE</span> :: In some cases, the Authorization Server and the Resource Server may be ONE.</p>
    <p>Installation and Setup</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The installation will be on a <span>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</span> based Linux desktop.</p>
      <p>Ensure <span>Docker</span> is installed on the system. Else, follow the instructions provided in the article
        <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/Docker.html" target="_blank"><span>Introduction to Docker</span></a>
        to complete the installation.</p>
    </div>
    <p>There are few open source implementations of the Authorization Server that implement the OAuth2/OIDC standards as follows:</p>
    
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>For our setup and demonstration, we will use the <span>Keycloak</span> Authorization Server in conjuction
        with the <span>PostgreSQL</span> database.</p>

<p>The goal is to create a more secure web environment. By reducing the certificate lifetime to a maximum of 398 days, or roughly 1 year and a month, it forces administrators to <em>rotate certificates more frequently</em>.</p>
<p>By doing so, the private &amp; public keys get changed. Anyone that managed to compromise the private key will only see it be useful for, at most, a year.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean? <a href="#what-does-this-mean"> #</a></h2>
<p>Any new certificate that is issued <em>after September 1st, 2020</em> will at most be valid for a year <sup>(*)</sup>.</p>
<p>Some vendors still allow you to purchase multi-year certificates. How does that work then? Well, you'll get a discount for the multi-year purchase, and every year they'll send you a new certificate to replace the previous one.</p>
<p>At that point, you take counter-party risk as you're betting on the company still existing in 3 years to provide the certificates you already paid for.</p>
<p><sup>This only applies to publicly trusted certificates. If you've deployed your own internal CA, those certificate lifetimes may still exceed 398 days.</sup></p>
<h2 id="whats-going-on-behind-the-scenes">What's going on behind the scenes? <a href="#whats-going-on-behind-the-scenes"> #</a></h2>
<p>The story is actually quite fascinating!</p>
<p>Last year, members at Google initiated a <a href="https://cabforum.org/2019/09/10/ballot-sc22-reduce-certificate-lifetimes-v2/">ballot to reduce the maximum certificate lifetime to 1yr</a>. The ballot is done via the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/B Forum</a>, the industry standard way that groups SSL issuers, browsers, important stakeholders, etc.</p>
<p>The ballot failed. The <em>industry</em> failed to come to a consensus and thus, no new rules were created to limit certificate lifetime.</p>
<p>Now this is where it gets interesting. Votes are split between certificate <em>issuers</em> and <em>consumers</em>. The issuers, or the ones where you <em>buy</em> your certificates from, voted mostly <em>against</em> the proposal.</p>
<p>The <em>consumers</em> of the certificates, or the browsers, all voted <em>for</em> the proposal.</p>
<p>Quite an imbalance there, isn't it?</p>
<p>A few months later, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211025">Apple announced it would limit certificate lifetime in Safari</a>. One browser started to adhere to more strict certificate validation rules on its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/net/docs/certificate_lifetimes.md">Google's Chrome</a> and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/07/09/reducing-tls-certificate-lifespans-to-398-days/">Mozilla's Firefox</a> quickly followed with their own announcements.</p>
<p>Even though no consensus could be reached through the CA/B Forum, because the browser that hold 80%+ of the market share agreed to limit the certificate lifetime, the <em>issuers</em> of certificates have no choice but to follow along.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-feel-about-this">What do we feel about this? <a href="#what-do-we-feel-about-this"> #</a></h2>
<p>We applaud this move in general because it does a few things very well:</p>
<ol>
<li>It forces more rapid recycling of public certificates</li>
<li>It promotes automation, to reduce the burden</li>
<li>It will ultimately lead to bigger adoption of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. If you're going to automate your certificate renewal, why not use free ones at the same time?</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time, it also shows the imbalance of a public forum like CA/B.</p>
<p>This move is generally positive, but if a major browser would unilaterally decide to implement a <em>negative</em> change to certificate management instead, is everyone else forced to adopt that too?</p>
<p>It's food for thought, for sure.</p>
<h2 id="increased-need-for-certificate-monitoring">Increased need for certificate monitoring <a href="#increased-need-for-certificate-monitoring"> #</a></h2>
<p>Of course, with the max lifetime of certificates decreased, you'll be having to replace your certificates more often.</p>
<p>Oh Dear can give you peace of mind with <a href="https://ohdear.app/feature/certificate-monitoring">extended certificate monitoring</a>. We'll keep you informed on the expiration days.</p>
<p>Because we now need to check for both <em>expiration</em> and <em>validity</em> times, we added additional checks that will inform you if you have a certificate that exceeds the 398 days threshold.</p>
<p><img src="https://ohdear.app/img/blogs/certificate-max-1yr-validity/certificate-lifetime-validation.png" alt="Maximum lifetime validation"></p>
<p>On top of that, we can let you know once your certificates <em>change</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine you're replacing a certificate, but are you 100% certain you've included all the same domains/SANs and it covers all the right hostnames? We've got you covered.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

    <p>With everything that we have added to our library so far we are almost capable of generated small
tunes. One thing that’s missing to make it sound more ‘natural’ is a way for the notes to start and
stop.</p>
<p>In this post we will implement a type of envelope called “ADSR”, for “Attack, Decay, Sustain,
Release”. Which will make the notes sound more natural as they are played in sequence.</p>
<p>To see why we need this, listen to this sound generated without an ADSR envelope around the
generated frames.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part10/no_adsr.wav">Without ADSR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part10/adsr.wav">With ADSR</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to read the (not pretty) code that generated this, check out this <a href="https://gist.github.com/DylanMeeus/83f3ae5d628d11533b8fbd47298d8434">github
gist</a>.</p>

<p>The Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release envelope is a common type of envelope. Schematically this can
be represented as below (from wikipedia):</p>
<p><img src="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part10/adsrschema.png" alt="Wikipedia schematic of ADSR envelope"></p>
<p>As we apply this envelope to a signal, the signal will change in amplitude depending on which phase
we are in of the ADSR envelope. In the image it is visible that the amplitude rises during the
attack step, reaches a peak amplitude before decreasing a bit. After decreasing it reached the
sustain amplitude, where it will stay until the note is released, and after release it decays until
the ampltide is zero.</p>
<p>For our parameters, three will relate to time:</p>
<ul>
<li>attack (time to rise)</li>
<li>decay (time to fall to sustain level)</li>
<li>release (time to decay from sutan to zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the Sustain parameter does not refer to time, but rather to the amplitude we will maintain.</p>
<p>Turning this schematic into code, we get :</p>

</div><p>One parameter in this function that you don’t find in the schematic is the need for a control rate.
The control rate will be used to turn a duration in seconds into an amount of frames. The control
rate could just be sample rate but this does not necessarily have to be the case. One such use-case
us sub-audio modulation, whereby the modulating oscillator is running below 20Hz. You can check
<a href="https://cmtext.indiana.edu/synthesis/chapter4_modulation.php">this chapter</a> for a bit more on that.</p>

<p>To apply the ADSR envelope to a signal, for example to one that was generating using the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt8.md">oscillator
we created</a> we have to iterate over
each frame, pass the current frame to the ADSR function, and modify the amplitude of the frame with
the result. For example, this is the complete example program included in
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/examples/adsr/main.go">GoAudio</a>.</p>

<p><a name="cut"></a>
Imagine you're developing a service... For certainty, let's call it <em>A</em>. It's going to provide some public HTTP API to its clients. However, to serve requests it needs to call another service. Let's call this upstream service - <em>B</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/10-service-a-service-b.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Obviously, neither network nor service <em>B</em> is ideal. If service <em>A</em> wants to decrease the impact of the failing upstream requests on its public API success rate, it has to do something about errors. For instance, it could start retrying failed requests.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/20-service-a-service-b-with-retries.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Implementation of the retry mechanism requires some code changes in the service <em>A</em>, but the codebase is fresh, there are tons of advanced HTTP libraries, so you just need to grab one... Easy-peasy, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this simplicity is not always the case. Replace service <em>A</em> with service <em>Z</em> that was written 10 years ago in some esoteric language by a developer that already retired. Or add to the equitation services <em>Q</em>, <em>U</em>, and <em>X</em> written by different teams in three different languages. As a result, the cumulative cost of the company-wide retry mechanism implementation in the code gets really high...</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/30-service-qux-service-b.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>But what if retries are not the only thing you need? Proper <em>request timeouts</em> have to be ensured as well. And how about <em>distributed tracing</em>? It'd be nice to correlate the whole request tree with the original customer transaction by propagating some additional HTTP headers. However, every such capability would make the HTTP libraries even more bloated...</p>

<p>Let's try to go one level higher... or lower? 🤔</p>
<p>In our original setup, service <em>A</em> has been communicating with service <em>B</em> directly. But what if we put an intermediary infrastructure component in between those services? Thanks to containerization, orchestration, devops, <del>add a buzz word of your choice here</del>, nowadays, it became so simple to configure infrastructure, that the cost of adding another infra component is often lower than the cost of writing application code...</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/40-service-a-sidecar-service-b.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, let's call the box enclosing the service <em>A</em> and the secret intermediary component <em>a server</em> (bare metal or virtual, doesn't really matter). And now it's about time to introduce one of the fancy words from the article's title. Any piece of software running on the server <em>alongside</em> the primary service and helping it do its job is called <em>a sidecar</em>. I hope, the idea behind the name is more or less straightforward here.</p>
<p>But getting back to the service-to-service communication problem, what sidecar should we use to keep the service code free of the low-level details such as retries or request tracing? Well, the needed piece of software is called a <em>service proxy</em>. Probably, the most widely used implementation of the service proxy in the real world is <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">envoy</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of the service proxy is the following: instead of accessing the service <em>B</em> directly, code in the service <em>A</em> now will be sending requests to the service proxy sidecar. Since both of the processes run on the same server, the loopback network interface (i.e. <code>127.0.0.1</code> <em>aka</em> <code>localhost</code>) is perfectly suitable for this part of the communication. On every received HTTP request, the service proxy sidecar will make a request to the upstream service using the external network interface of the server. The response from the upstream will be eventually forwarded back by the sidecar to the service <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>I think, at this time, it's already obvious where the retry, timeouts, tracing, etc. logic should reside. Having this kind of functionality provided by a separate sidecar process makes enhancing any service written in any language with such capabilities rather trivial.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, that service proxy could be used not only for outgoing traffic (egress) but also for the incoming traffic (ingress) of the service <em>A</em>. Usually, there is plenty of cross-cutting things that can be tackled on the ingress stage. For instance, proxy sidecars can do <em>SSL</em> termination, request authentication, and more. A detailed diagram of a single server setup could look something like that:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/50-single-host-sidecar.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Probably, the last fancy term we are going to cover here is <em>a pod</em>. People have been deploying code using virtual machines or bare metal servers for a long time... A server itself is already a good abstraction and a unit of encapsulation. For instance, every server has at least one external network interface, a network loopback interface for the internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">IPC</a> needs, and it can run a bunch of processes sharing access to these communication means. Servers are usually addressable within the private network of the company by their IPs. Last but not least, it's pretty common to use a whole server for a single purpose (otherwise, maintenance quickly becomes a nightmare). I.e. you may have a group of identical servers running instances of service <em>A</em>, another group of servers each running an instance of service <em>B</em>, etc. So, why on earth would anybody want something better than a server?</p>
<p>Despite being a good abstraction, the orchestration overhead servers introduce is often too high. So people started thinking about how to package applications more efficiently and that's how we got containers. Well, probably you know that <em>Docker</em> and <em>container</em> had been kind of a synonym for a long time and folks from Docker have been actively advocating for <em>"a one process per container"</em> model. Obviously, this model is pretty different from the widely used <em>server</em> abstraction where multiple processes are allowed to work side by side. And that's how we got the concept of <em>pods</em>. A pod is just a group of containers sharing a bunch of namespaces. If we now run a single process per container all of the processes in the pod will still share the common execution environment. In particular, the network namespace. Thus, all the containers in the pod will have a shared loopback interface and a shared external interface with an IP address assigned to it. Then it's up to the orchestration layer (say hi to Kubernetes) how to make all the pods reachable within the network by their IPs. And that's how people reinvented servers...</p>
<p>So, getting back to all those blue boxes enclosing the service process and the sidecar on the diagrams above - we can think of them as being either a virtual machine, a bare metal server, or a pod. All three of them are more or less interchangeable abstractions.</p>
<p>To summarize, let's try to visualize how the service to service communication could look like with the proxy sidecars:</p>

<p>Since the only way to really understand something is to <del>write a blog post about it</del> implement it yourself, let's quickly hack a <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground">demo environment</a>.</p>
<h4 id="a-nameservice-a-talks-to-service-b-directlyaservice-a-talks-to-service-b-directly"><a name="service-a-talks-to-service-b-directly"></a>Service A talks to service B directly</h4>
<p>We will start from the simple setup where service <em>A</em> will be accessing service <em>B</em> directly:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/service-proxy-pod-sidecar-oh-my/70-demo-direct.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>The code of the <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-a">service <em>A</em></a> is relatively straightforward. It's just a simple HTTP server that makes a call to its upstream service <em>B</em> on every client request. Depending on the response from the upstream, <em>A</em> returns either an HTTP 200 or HTTP 500 to the client.</p>
<pre><code>package main

// ...

var requestCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
    prometheus.CounterOpts{
        Name: "service_a_requests_total",
        Help: "The total number of requests received by Service A.",
    },
    []string{"status"},
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    resp, err := httpGet(os.Getenv("UPSTREAM_SERVICE"))
    if err == nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "Service A: upstream responded with:", resp)
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("2xx").Inc()
    } else {
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Service A: upstream failed with: %v", err.Error()),
            http.StatusInternalServerError)
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("5xx").Inc()
    }
}

func main() {
    // init prometheus /metrics endpoint

    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(
        os.Getenv("SERVICE_HOST")+":"+os.Getenv("SERVICE_PORT"), nil))
}</code></pre>
<p><i>(see full version on <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-a/main.go">GitHub</a>)</i></p>

<p>Notice that instead of hard-coding, we use <code>SERVICE_HOST</code> and <code>SERVICE_PORT</code> env variables to specify the host and port of the HTTP API endpoint. It'll come in handy soon. Additionally, the code of the service relies on the <code>UPSTREAM_SERVICE</code> env variable when accessing the upstream service <em>B</em>.</p>
<p>To get some visibility, the code is instrumented with the primitive counter metric <code>service_a_requests_total</code> that gets incremented on every incoming request. We will use an instance of <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/prometheus">prometheus</a> service to scrape the metrics exposed by the service <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>The implementation of the upstream <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-b">service <em>B</em></a> is trivial as well. It's yet another HTTP server. However its behavior is rather close to a static endpoint.</p>
<pre><code>package main

// ...

var ERROR_RATE int

var (
    requestCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "service_b_requests_total",
            Help: "The total number of requests received by Service B.",
        },

    )

    if rand.Intn(100) &gt;= ERROR_RATE {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "Service B: Yay! nounce", rand.Uint32())
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues("2xx").Inc()
    } else {
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Service B: Ooops... nounce %v", rand.Uint32()),
            http.StatusInternalServerError)

<p><i>(see full version on <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/envoy-playground/tree/master/basics/service-b/main.go">GitHub</a>)</i></p>

<p>Probably the only interesting part here is <code>ERROR_RATE</code>. The service is designed to fail requests with some constant rate, i.e. if <code>ERROR_RATE</code> is <em>20</em>, approximately 20% of requests will fail with HTTP 500 status code. As with the service <em>A</em>, we will use prometheus to scrape basic usage statistics, see the counter <code>service_b_requests_tot…</code></p></div></div>

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>
<h2 id="docker-network-theory">Docker Network Theory</h2>
<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-host-network-bridge">Single-host network bridge</h2>
<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>



<center>—</center>



<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Notes</p>



<p>I could go on and on …</p></div></div>

We are what society expects us to be at that age.</p><p>I refuse to believe this.&nbsp;</p><p>I was already a kid and I had an interesting childhood. And I can’t tell you much about adulthood because, well, I’m not there yet. In this essay, I will focus on the teenage years and why some teens you should not chill out and <em>just be a teenager.</em></p><p>When you are a teenager, you go to high school and study to get ready for college. If you’re mildly ambitious, you play sports. If you’re somewhat ambitious, you enroll in extracurricular activities in school. If you’re ambitious, you’d play sports and take part in extracurricular activities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">crazy ambitious,</a> you do all the above and go beyond like starting companies, nonprofits, public speaking, etc. You are on a different wavelength of life. Somehow, certain kids break out of the normal way of being and <em>think differently.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/tyler-cowen-production-function" target="_blank">North Star Podcast interview</a>, the economist Tyler Cowen is asked why there aren’t more Tyler Cowens in the world. He says:</p><blockquote><p>You have to ask at some point, what are the <strong>returns</strong> both to <strong>starting early </strong>and to <strong>continuing fairly late</strong> in life? So starting early, you give up a <strong>normal childhood.</strong> I would say all for the better. Awesome. Bring it on. Let's double down on that one. But most people don't want to do that, or it just doesn't occur to them. They might in fact do it if they saw more<strong> role models.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I also gave up a “normal childhood.” I didn’t think about the returns or anything like that, I thought about what makes me happy, what makes me curious, and what makes me.&nbsp;</p><p>“But those crazy ambitious kids are dumb. They should just go out with friends, go to parties, make silly mistakes, and be a freaking teenager.” Hell yeah! Again, why bother?</p><p>If you have goals, there’s no need to pursue them. If you have passions, pursue them later. If you have curiosities, bro I don’t even know what those are.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll have time…</p><p>Adults tell you should be a teen and enjoy these years. And don’t even worry about doing something too hard or complicated. After all, “you should be a teenager.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t, these adults tell you that you will regret it. So what? Just be and do what you’re supposed to do, watch TV, use your phone, and follow the path of everyone else mindlessly. By the way, don’t forget to be happy [1].</p><p>But who are these adults? They are adults who aren't enjoying adulthood. They look back to when they were kids with no responsibilities. What if we checked with adults who love adulthood? You’ll get a different story.&nbsp;</p><p>You have the same experiences that everyone has at the expense of extraordinary experiences you can create for yourself such as creating a project, starting a company, building your own video game, and sharing your gifts with the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Hold up. What are you talking about? “You should be a teenager, don’t do any of that. That’s not cool. If you don’t try too hard and enjoy your childhood, you’ll be happy.” Right, right. Thanks for your advice.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are a few teens out there who think differently and imagine a world of opportunities where age, credentials, or money isn’t a limiting factor, but an <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/leverage"><span>advantage</span></a>. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who rule the world. The crazy ambitious kids are the ones who make things happen.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>As the 2020 US Presidential election grinds on, it makes me wonder if we need to unlearn the idea of a Nation State. The assumption that geographically collocated people share the same core identity and values seems quaint in just about every nation state these days. If we unlearn this increasingly fallacious idea, we might open ourselves up to something new.</p>

<p>I live in a small, Virginia college town, Charlottesville. We share increasingly little in common with people living 30 miles away. With no shared values, not even a shared perspective of what’s true, it makes little sense to share political institutions. We live in different worlds - I bet many Charlottesvillians could navigate the London Tube with greater ease than the streets of nearby Dillwyn or Buena Vista. The interaction between these groups occurs purely on economic lines, often in <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/09/10/america-has-two-economies-and-theyre-diverging-fast/">two parallel economies</a>.</p>

<p>Even more, if you put me in a room with a random Berliner or Londoner, It’s likely we would share a similar positive attitude towards diversity and inclusion. We’d enjoy similar sources of culture and entertainment, perhaps even curious about each other’s weird sports. There’s probably even a greater likelihood we’d discuss political ideas with an open mind. Indeed, I’ve had more conversations about Brexit with a British person than about Trump with a Trump supporter. Increasingly, we have a shared outlook with other educated, urban places around the world. We feel alien to fellow Americans, Brits, or Germans that live a stone’s throw away.</p>

<p>Instead of different nation states, the world’s turning into one big emerging city with a large, vast, global hinterland. With the Internet and easy air travel - Manhattan, SOHO, and Pankow feel like different neighborhoods in the same global city – not identical, but increasingly cut from a similar cloth. All supporting increasingly culturally aligned knowledge workers. Some places (like a college town, or small city) feel less ‘central’ to the emerging one-global-city, similar to an outer suburb. Some places seem much more central (Manhattan?). And certainly the ‘neighborhoods’ I know about are more culturally nearby. But that will certainly change over the 21st century as places (and people) sort themselves closer or farther from the center. (And even in a ‘remote centric’ world, this’ll be true, as we need places with good Internet and comparable social values)</p>

<p>The hinterlands deeply resent the emerging, educated, cosmopolitan one-global-city. Certainty, this had a lot to do with Trump being elected. Fear that a multicultural knowledge economy might trump nation state protected privileges runs deep. This fear underpins much of the anti-intellectualism and anti-immigration extremism in these groups. Notably Trump also seems to evoke a kind of nostalgia about an 80s era strong American nation state and criticizes opponents for supporting “open borders” and not being “true Americans”. This division between one-global-city nation-state-first perspectives goes beyond the US. It’s happening in Poland, Turkey, Germany and just about everywhere.</p>

<p>If we unlearn the nation state, we might begin to see this emerging, new society. Some might be brave enough to embrace it as an explicit, core ideology. This might let us build new institutions centered on this one-global-city. The closest institutions we have right now are heavily globalized tech companies . They explicitly work to build multi-national workforces, heavily aware of the inclusion and multiculturalism needed to pull something like this off. Certainly methods of collaborating in tech, such as sharing code on Github, and participating in common communities also underpins the one-global-city. Social media might provide a kind of hub for the one-global-city (as well as the disaffected).</p>

<p>But there’s reasons to be skeptical too. As the one-global-city develops, it will push more and more marginalized people out to the hinterlands. A one-global-city with aligned / same political institutions is perhaps an educated elite fiction. Or if it exists, it’s not morally superior to a nation state that looks out for all it’s citizens. A one-global-city might turn into a caste society, with upper class tech / knowledge workers and then everyone else. We’ll continue to live in an awkward economic sybmiosis. Like two species that both need and hate each other. Always at low-level of conflict, but not enough to blow out into some massive war.</p>

<p>Maybe, in the end, it’s the one-global city – the globalized, neo-liberal, New World Order that will need to be unlearned. Perhaps, it’s the hinterlands that will tame their elites - attenuating their ability to connect with the rest of the world. Nation states reassert themselves as explicitly anti-intellectual, parochial entities. Sometimes choosing ignorance and isolation to maintain national sovereignty.</p>

<p>Who knows? It’ll be interesting to observe the rest of my life to maybe find out?</p>

<p>One of the first concepts new developers learn is the if/else statement.  If/else statements are the most common way to execute conditional logic. However, complex and nested if/else statements can quickly become a cognitive burden and compromise the readability of a program.</p>



<h2>Guard Clauses</h2>



<p>Guard Clauses leverage the ability to return early from a function (or continue through a loop) to make nested conditionals one-dimensional. Instead of using if/else chains, we simply return early from the function at the end of each conditional block:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func divide(dividend, divisor int) (int, error) {
	if divisor == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
	}
	return dividend/divisor, nil
}</code></pre>



<p>Error handling in Go naturally encourages developers to make use of guard clauses. When I started writing more JavaScript, I was disappointed to see how many nested conditionals existed in the code I was working on. </p>



<p>Let’s take a look at an exaggerated example of nested conditional logic:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">function getInsuranceAmount(status) {
  let amount;
  if (!status.hasInsurance()){
    amount = 1;
  } else {
    if (status.isTotaled()){
      amount = 10000;
    } else {
      if (status.isDented()){
        amount = 160;
        if (status.isBigDent()){
          amount = 270;
        }
      } else {
        amount = 0
      }
    }
  }
  return amount;
}</code></pre>



<p>Could be written with guard clauses instead:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">function getInsuranceAmount(status) {
  if (!status.hasInsurance()){
    return 1;
  }
  if (status.isTotaled()){
    return 10000;
  }
  if (!status.isDented()){
    return 0;
  }
  if (status.isBigDent()){
    return 270;
  }
  return 160;
}</code></pre>



<p>The example above is <strong>much </strong>easier to read and understand. When writing code, it is important to try to reduce the cognitive load on the reader by reducing the number of entities they need to think about at any given time.</p>



<p>In the first example, if the developer is trying to figure out when <strong>270</strong> is returned, they need to think about each branch in the logic tree and try to remember which cases matter and which cases don’t. With the one dimensional structure offered by guard clauses, it’s as simple as stepping through each case in order.</p>

<p>Choosing good colors for your charts is hard. This article tries to make it easier.</p>
<p>I want you to feel more confident in your color choices. And if you have no sense for colors at all, here’s my attempt to help you find good ones anyway. We’ll talk about common color mistakes I see out there in the wild, and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive colors for different <strong>categories (e.g. continents, industries, bird species)</strong> for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., read on.</p>

<a href="#13"><b>13</b> Copy colors, or understand them</a></p>

<h4 id="Before-we-start…">Before we start…</h4>
<p>I will mention saturation, brightness and hue a lot. The HSB (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>B</strong>rightness) or HSV (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>V</strong>alue) color spaces work fairly well to check them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hue</strong> ranges from 0° to 360°…that’s your typical color wheel: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
<li><strong>Saturation</strong> ranges from 0% (grey) to 100% (super duper colorful!!): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
<li><strong>Brightness/Value</strong> ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (the actual color): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To convert your colors from HEX (e.g. <code>#cc0000</code>) or RGB (e.g. <code>rgb(207, 176, 58)</code>) to HSB/HSV, use a tool like <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colorizer.org</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A relative of HSB/HSV is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCL</a> color space. It uses the same parameters (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>C</strong>hroma = saturation, <strong>L</strong>ightness), but is closer to “how we really see colors”. <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/255-how-to-pick-colors-in-datawrapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Datawrapper</strong> uses the HCL color space</a> for its color picker:</p>
<p><img alt="HCL color picker in Datawrapper" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors31.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors31.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors31.png"></p>
<p>But since you won’t find HCL in Adobe Photoshop or <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorizer.org</a>, every time I mention degrees (like 0°) or percentages, I’ll be talking about the HSB/HSV color space.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s do this:</p>

<h4 id="Broaden-your-understanding-of-colors">Broaden your understanding of colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors30.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors30.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors30.png"></p>
<p>You might think like this: “I need five colors for my chart. So I use green and yellow and blue and red. And …um…maybe orange? Or purple!”</p>
<p>If you haven’t thought much about colors since you were a kid coloring out your coloring book, this thought makes sense. So today I’m here to tell you: They are more colors than that.</p>
<p>Look at this graphic and compare them with the basic colors <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors13.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png"><em><a href="https://whydocatsanddogs.com/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do Cats and Dogs?</a> by Nadieh Bremer</em></p>
<p>They’re different. The red that Nadieh uses <span>⬤</span> is different from your typical red <span>⬤</span>. The green <span>⬤</span> is…can you even call it a green <span>⬤</span>?</p>
<p>So before we impose rules that limit us, let me freak you out a bit: There are thousands of colors you can use. There is yellow-ish red <span>⬤</span> and blue-ish red <span>⬤</span> and everything in between. There is grey <span>⬤</span>, but there is also cold grey <span>⬤</span> and there is warm grey <span>⬤</span>. And then there is blue. So much blue! Like this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span> and this <span>⬤</span>. And we haven’t even talked about orange and yellow.</p>
<p>You have <em>lots</em> of options. Which means you can stay in a small area of the color wheel and still have many options. Which means:</p>

<h4 id="Don’t-dance-all-over-the-color-wheel">Don’t dance all over the color wheel</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors28.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors28.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors28.png"></p>
<p>There’s no need to rely on hues from all around the color wheel like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> for your visualizations. It will look more professional – and therefore more trustworthy – when it only uses a few hues and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Here’s where it becomes a good idea to actually look at a color wheel. You can use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a> or <a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> to do so.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors21.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors21.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors21.png"><em><a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> harmonies</em></p>
<p>Lots of these tools let you choose different harmonies. One of them is called “square” or “tetradic”. <strong>Don’t use it.</strong> It will result in too many hues –&nbsp;and we’re on a mission to avoid that.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/200805_goodcolors20.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>In the video above, I used the color tool <a href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paletton</a> to start with a tetradic harmony and then decrease the distance. Note how more beautiful the color combinations become.</p>
<p>If the distance becomes small enough, you’re basically using <strong>complementary</strong> colors. And that’s a great choice! Lots of complementary color pairs work awesome together. <strong>If in doubt, use complementary colors and their neighbors.</strong></p>
<p>So let’s do this –&nbsp;this time with Adobe Color:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors22.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors22.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors22.png"><em>Our complementary colors in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a></em></p>
<p>Our colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, so they’re clearly complementary. Yay! But they’re also unusable: The two oranges are way too similar. And everything looks so…bright.</p>
<p>There’s where we need to change the saturation and lightness:</p>

<h4 id="Use-saturation-and-lightness-to-make-your-hues-work">Use saturation and lightness to make your hues work</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors27.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors27.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors27.png"></p>
<p>Saturation and brightness are as important as hue. In fact, you can create new colors when you just change the saturation and brightness. Here are two color pairs with the same hue, just different saturation and lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. (If you change the hue just a tiny bit, you’ll achieve even better results: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>
<p>Let’s come back to our color combination: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. After playing around with the saturation and darkness, it becomes this:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors23.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors23.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors23.png"><em>Our better (!) complementary colors in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a></em></p>
<p>I desaturated the light blue <span>⬤</span> and the lighter orange <span>⬤</span> and made every color darker except the lighter orange. Heck yeah, we can work with that!</p>
<p>So if your color combination doesn’t look awesome yet, don’t immediately add another hue. <strong>Change the saturation and lightness first and see if that’s better.</strong></p>
<p>That’s what I did to all of these color palettes: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They’re all roughly complementary, and they all come with different saturations and lightness. That’s what makes them work.</p>

<h4 id="Use-warm-colors-blue">Use warm colors &amp; blue</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors29.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors29.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors29.png"></p>
<p>There’s a complementary color combination that is especially loved by data visualization designers: <strong>yellow/orange/red and blue</strong>. Scroll through graphics portfolios like the one from the <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a> or this one by <a href="https://infographics.economist.com/2019/AChristmasGiftForYou/AYearInGraphicDetail.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist (PDF)</a> and you’ll notice that they use these colors far more often than colors like purple or green.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors19.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors19.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors19.png"><em><a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three pages by The South China Morning Post</a></em></p>
<p>That’s because these warm colors and blue are super versatile for categories. Yellow and orange and red look very pleasing together, but people will still perceive them as different colors: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> –&nbsp;which is exactly what we want for categorical colors. And blue is more flexible than any other hue: Lots of blues, no matter if dark <span>⬤</span> or light <span>⬤</span> or saturated <span>⬤</span> or not saturated <span>⬤</span>, look pleasing, calming and professional.</p>
<p>And they are accessible: colorblind people can easily distinguish blue and orange/red from each other.</p>
<p>So if in doubt, use an orange/red with blue.</p>

<h4 id="When-using-green-make-it-a-yellow-or-blue-one">When using green, make it a yellow or blue one</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors26.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors26.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors26.png"></p>
<p>Forest green covers a full sixth on the color wheel, from approximately 90° <span>⬤</span> to 150° <span>⬤</span>, with 120° as its peak <span>⬤</span>. However, you will find few well-designed visualizations that use it. Why is that?</p>
<p>First, forest green is just very dark. And lightening up the forest green means going into an awkward neon <span>⬤</span>. So you need to lighten up <em>and</em> desaturate green enormously – more than other colors –&nbsp;to get to a nice one. That’s exactly what the Washington Post does with their green <span>⬤</span> here:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors17.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors17.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors17.png"><em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-rolling-back-obama-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Trump is rolling back Obama’s legacy<br>
</a> by The Washington Post</em></p>
<p>It’s a 142° green, but only 14% saturated. Here’s what the same hue with the same brightness would look like 100% saturated: <span>⬤</span>. Yikes.</p>
<p>And remember our colorblind friends: A pure green in combination with red, orange or brown is hard for them to distinguish.</p>
<p>So when using green, make it a bit yellow or a bit blue. You can see this in the examples at the top of this article: All of the greens except FiveThirtyEight’s one <span>⬤</span> have a hue greater than 160° (=bluer) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or lower than 60° (=more yellow) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. Nadieh uses both yellow green and blue green in this project we’ve already seen:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors13.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors13.png"><em><a href="https://whydocatsanddogs.com/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do Cats and Dogs?</a> by Nadieh Bremer</em></p>
<p>Looks like you can use them in your visualization as two different colors as Nadieh does: Win-win!</p>

<h4 id="Avoid-pure-colors">Avoid pure colors</h4>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors5.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors5.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors5.png"></p>
<p>“Pure” hues are the ones that are located at exactly 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° or 360°/0° in the color wheel:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-200805_goodcolors7.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors7.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-200805_goodcolors7.png"></p>
<p>Here’s an example: In HSV/HSB, the <strong>H</strong>ue value of this bright blue <span>⬤</span> is 180°, the <strong>S</strong>aturation value is 67% and the <strong>L</strong>ightness value is 91%. You can also check the RGB values of your color: If at least two of the values are the same, they’re “pure”. For example, our <span>⬤</span> is a <code>rgb(77, 232, 232)</code>.</p>
<p>To make your colors look more natural and pleasing to the eyes of your readers, you can either tune down the saturation of pure colors or make them darker. <strong>If you want to have bright, saturated colors, rely on mixed colors</strong> that are at least 5-10° away from the pure colors.</p>
<p>In the image above, the red and orange, the blues and the greens have the same saturation and lightness. The only difference is the hue: The red <span>⬤</span> (0°), blue <span>⬤</span> (240°) and green <span>⬤</span> (120°) look more colorful than the orange <span>⬤</span> (40°), medium blue <span>⬤</span> (211°) and blue-ish green <span>⬤</span> (170°).</p>

<p>Neon colors will definitely attract the attention of readers. But these readers won’t thank you. Most of us get a bit stressed out when we see them: “Highly saturated, light colors will NOT be appropriate [to communicate] Serious or Trust, or Calm,” as Bartram, Patra &amp; Stone explain in their paper “Affective Color in Visualization” from 2017 (<a href="https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/Affective%20Color%20CHI%202017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>If your colors come close to 100% saturation <strong>and</strong> 100% brightness, it’s likely your colors are too colorful. That’s definitely the case for pure colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</p>
<p>“But I’ve seen such crazy colors before, and they look good,” you might say, and refer to projects like these ones:</p>

<p>If you compare the colors from these examples with colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>, you see how they former ones are all less saturated or darker. A 100% saturated and 100% bright green <span>⬤</span> becomes less saturated in the New York Times <span>⬤</span>, and less saturated <em>and</em> darker in both the Bloomberg article <span>⬤</span> and the Pudding article <span>⬤</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="mcpu-emu--an-emulator-for-mcpu">mcpu-emu : an emulator for MCPU</h2>

<p>MCPU is a neat minimal 8-bit CPU (CPU design by Tim Boescke in 2001, cpldcpu@opencores.org) - see its <a href="https://opencores.org/projects/mcpu">opencores project file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU">GitHub repo</a>. It fits into 32 macrocells on a CPLD and can operate on 64 bytes of RAM.</p>

<p>Being a minimal CPU it supports only four 8-bit instructions, that consist of 2 bit opcode and 6 bit address/immediate field.</p>

<p>It has two registers - an 8-bit accumulator and 6-bit program counter. MCPU supports 64 bytes of RAM shared between program and data.</p>

<p>The instruction set is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>mnemonic</th>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>NOR</td>
      <td>00AAAAAA</td>
      <td>Acc = Acc NOR mem[AAAAAA]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ADD</td>
      <td>01AAAAAA</td>
      <td>Acc = Acc +  mem[AAAAAA], update carry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>STA</td>
      <td>10AAAAAA</td>
      <td>mem[AAAAAA] = Acc</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JCC</td>
      <td>11AAAAAA</td>
      <td>PC = AAAAAA if carry = 0, clear carry</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I’ve also added an “OUT” instruction according to Jean-Claude Wippler’s <a href="https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc---a-minimal-computer/">TFoC - A minimal computer</a> article, with the opcode of 0xFF that prints the accumulator to the standard output.</p>

<h2 id="the-emulator">The emulator</h2>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>mcpu_state</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>uint8_t</span> <span>accu</span> <span>:</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uint8_t</span> <span>carry</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uint8_t</span> <span>pc</span> <span>:</span> <span>6</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uint8_t</span> <span>memory</span><span>[</span><span>MEM_SIZE</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>mcpu_state</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the emulation loop dispatches to instruction handlers based on the first two bits of the opcode.</p>

<p>I decided to represent the state of the CPU with a bitfield structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//Acc = Acc NOR mem[AAAAAA]</span>
<span>void</span> <span>nor</span><span>(</span><span>mcpu_state</span><span>*</span> <span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>uint8_t</span> <span>opcode</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>carry</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can optionally print out the currently executed instruction with a small disassembler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>disassemble</span><span>(</span><span>mcpu_state</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<h3 id="getting-some-test-programs">Getting some test programs</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://jeelabs.org/2017/11/tfoc---a-minimal-computer/">TFoC - A minimal computer</a> article comes with two code examples, with the code formatted as a hexdump</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3E 45 7F C2 C4 FA 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF 01
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I converted this to a binary file (easier to consume by the C emulator)  with a following bash script that replaces the newlines with spaces, then gets rid of double spaces left by \r\n conversion and finally uses <code>xxd</code> to perform a “reverse hexdump”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/!bin/bash</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>$1</span> | <span>tr</span> <span>'\r\n'</span> <span>' '</span>  | <span>sed</span> <span>-e</span> <span>'s/[[:blank:]]\+/ /g'</span> | xxd <span>-r</span> <span>-p</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a disassembler and tweaking the output a bit  yields the following code</p>

<div><div><pre><code> <span>0</span><span>:</span>     <span>3</span><span>E</span>      <span>NOR</span> <span>$</span><span>3</span><span>E</span>    <span>; acc = 0    (from address 3E)</span>
 <span>1</span><span>:</span>     <span>45</span>      <span>ADD</span> <span>$</span> <span>5</span>    <span>; acc += 250 (from address 5)</span>
 <span>2</span><span>:</span>     <span>7</span><span>F</span>      <span>ADD</span> <span>$</span><span>3</span><span>F</span>    <span>; acc += 1   (from address 3F)</span>
 <span>3</span><span>:</span>     <span>C2</span>      <span>JCC</span> <span>$</span> <span>2</span>    <span>; if carry occurred, jump to line 2</span>
 <span>4</span><span>:</span>     <span>C4</span>      <span>JCC</span> <span>$</span> <span>4</span>    <span>; endless loop, jump to itself</span>
 <span>5</span><span>:</span>     <span>FA</span>      <span>-------</span>    <span>; literal 250</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>3</span><span>E</span><span>:</span>     <span>FF</span>      <span>-------</span>    <span>; literal 255</span>
<span>3</span><span>F</span><span>:</span>      <span>1</span>      <span>-------</span>    <span>; literal 1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that there are no immediate values, one can only work with what’s already in the memory, hence the literals 1, 250 and 255 need to exist somewhere within the RAM.</p>

<p>Stepping through the program shows it behaves as expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>NOR $3E [FF]          A:00 C:0 PC:01
ADD $05 [FA]          A:FA C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FB C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FB C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FC C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FC C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FD C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FD C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FE C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FE C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:FF C:0 PC:03
JCC $02               A:FF C:0 PC:02
ADD $3F [01]          A:00 C:1 PC:03
JCC $02               A:00 C:0 PC:04
JCC $04               A:00 C:0 PC:04
JCC $04               A:00 C:0 PC:04
.. [JCC $04 repeats in an endless loop]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seemed it would be a useful thing to add a simple infinite loop detection - if the JCC instruction is jumping to its own address, there is no escape from this state as it won’t change the carry flag.</p>

<p>A second example - printing out prime numbers that fit into 8-bit number (up to 251) is more complex. It also required adding the special output opcode as mentioned earlier to see the results.</p>

<h3 id="porting-to-a-potato-microcontroller">Porting to a <del>potato</del> microcontroller</h3>

<p>What’s the best way to appreciate an emulator for a minimal chip published almost 20 years ago? Porting and running it on the smallest CPU I have at home - an ATTiny85 chip, which has 512 bytes of RAM and runs at 16 MHz in the form of the <a href="http://digistump.com/products/1">Digispark USB development board</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/mcpu-digistump.jpg" alt="digistump"></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: The dev board sitting on top of the MCPU paper</em></p>

<p>There are two things that won’t work straightforward - there’s no filesystem to read the RAM/ROM binary from and  and there’s also no standard output.</p>

<h4 id="loading-the-binaries">Loading the binaries</h4>

<p>We can solve the first problem by including the emulated image to the source as a C array, <code>hexdump</code> can help producing the 0x-encoded bytes we need from the binary file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>hexdump <span>-ve</span> <span>'1/1 "0x%.2x,"'</span> prog_test.bin
0x3e,0x45,0x7f,0xc2,0xc4,...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way we can directly use a byte array as the ROM/RAM image.</p>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>

<p>We can solve the second problem by exploiting the fact that the DigiStump with ATTiny85 can act as an USB keyboard - so we just let it type out the output to the text editor of our choice.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//using this instead of printf() or Serial.print()</span>
<span>DigiKeyboard</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"NOR"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A 3-second delay after initializing the board helped get me ready to switch to a different text editor to capture the output instead of overwriting the source code :).</p>

<h4 id="code-golfing-to-trim-the-binary-size">Code golfing to trim the binary size</h4>

<p>The code also required some golfing as the maximum binary size for my ATTiny board is 6 kb. The tricks I used to slim down the compiled version included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inlining some functions</li>
  <li>simplifying the disassembler</li>
  <li>loading only the non-zero part of the binary</li>
</ul>

<p>Slimming the disassembler down:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>mnemonics</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"N"</span><span>,</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span><span>"S"</span><span>,</span><span>"J"</span><span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>disassemble</span><span>(</span><span>mcpu_state</span><span>*</span> <span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uint8_t</span> <span>opcode</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>memory</span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pc</span><span>];</span>
  <span>uint8_t</span> <span>immediate</span> <span>=</span> <span>opcode</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x3f</span><span>;</span>
  <span>sprintf</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>"%s $%02X [%02X]"</span><span>,</span> <span>mnemonics</span><span>[</span><span>opcode</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>6</span><span>],</span> <span>immediate</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>memory</span><span>[</span><span>immediate</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="random-code-golfing-tidbits">Random code golfing tidbits:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Printing the newline as a part of string and using <code>DigiKeyboard.print</code> instead of <code>DigiKeyboard.println</code> saves 14 bytes</li>
  <li>using <code>#define</code> instead of variables saves bytes</li>
  <li>replacing <code>sprintf()</code> with a series of <code>DigiKeyboard.print</code> calls saved 1.4 kb of the binary size!</li>
  <li>replacing <code>sprinf()</code></li>
  <li>loading the binary as a sequence of <code>state-&gt;memory[0] = 0x3e;</code> calls is shorter than initializing an array, and copying to CPU memory by a for loop in case of short binaries (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>That meant I had enough space to add blinking a LED and making a “tick” sound on a buzzer on every clock cycle! 
I ended up with a final binary size of <strong>4498 bytes</strong> for the prime-calculating binary with just the number as the output and <strong>4858 bytes</strong> with disassembler and status information in.</p>

<p>It’s also painfully slow - the delay between the first few and the last prime numbers is noticeable and it takes around 300 ms to calculate and print the very last primes (up to 255).</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>new</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>
    <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedDoubleArrayMap</span><span>,</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span>
    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

<h4>This page and associated codepens are meant to share with other developers a means of creating a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webmproject.org/">Webm</a>&nbsp;video from a dynamically generated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">canvas</a>&nbsp;driven from user input and a audio file. If this sounds interesting, keep reading.</h4>



<br>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>I’m&nbsp;Jason. I’m building&nbsp;<a href="https://vizibop.com/">Vizibop</a>, a service currently in beta that allows musicians and podcasters to quickly and easily create a unique MP4 video synched to a audio file. Yes, this is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/wavve/revenue">thing</a>.</p>



<p>At its core, Vizibop leverages a HTML Canvas, HTML5 Audio, MediaRecorder, and&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>&nbsp;to generate a WebM file with front end code only. From there, that WebM file is sent through&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/">AWS Elastic Transcoder</a>&nbsp;to convert the Webm file to a MP4 file which can then be shared on sites like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Here is a basic video created from Vizibop:</p>









<h2>Creating a basic animation</h2>



<p>P5.js is a javascript library that make drawing on a canvas relatively straight forward. Even for the mathematically challenged like myself,&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-particle-system.html">particles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html">flocking</a>&nbsp;are made easier to implement using P5. I am using P5&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode">instance</a>&nbsp;mode to keep things tidy. Here is a very basic scaffolding for a p5 animation:</p>

</p>








<br>



<h2>Playing Music</h2>



<p>Audio in the browser is a bit of a rabbit hole.&nbsp;<a href="https://howlerjs.com/">Howler</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://createjs.com/soundjs">SoundJS</a>&nbsp;will make your life a lot easier if you get into building jukeboxes and video games. To keep things simple, let’s simply create a hidden audio element and allow a user to click a button to begin playing a song. For Vizibop we allow users to upload their own songs in WAV or MP3 format using&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader">FileReader</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL">createObjectURL</a>.</p>



<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="Vizibop" data-slug-hash="qBZPMpv" data-pen-title="Play Music">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Vizibop/pen/qBZPMpv">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>Wiring Audio to P5</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound">P5.sound</a>&nbsp;module makes it super easy to have the variables within your sketch change based on the volume and frequency of a sound. Out of the box you can use&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Amplitude">Amplitude</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT">FFT</a>&nbsp;to do some pretty amazing things. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn1g1wjxl_0">Coding Train</a>&nbsp;has a whole series of videos on sound within P5 that I encourage you to watch.</p>



<p>In this example, we want to do some beat detection to change the background of the canvas. Beat detection also gets a little tricky depending on the song and quality of the underlying audio. In Vizibop we let the user define which frequency bands to key off of to really dial in more accurate beat detection.</p>



<p>But…….IOS 13 had a <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203435">major regression</a> with createMediaElementSource.  You can read about it <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203435">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58306894/has-ios13-broken-audio-tags-used-as-audio-buffers-connected-to-the-audio-conte">here </a>and here.  As of the writing of this document, creating a media element source on certain versions of IOS mobile is completely broken.  Supposedly this is fixed in IOS 13.6 and 14.  If you are on mobile IOS right now, this and all subsequent codepens are not going to be awesome.  </p>

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>








<br>



<h2>Customize the animation</h2>



<p>The animation above is pretty basic. A better experience allows the users to turn knobs and dials to customize their animation. In our case, I have tried to balance just enough knobs and dials to create a wide range of videos without overwhelming the user with too many options. The possibilities are really unlimited when you combine images, typography, color, motion, and math.</p>

</p>








<br>



<h2>Record a video</h2>



<p>We now have the key components to record a music video built entirely in the front end.</p>



<p>Now the fun begins, particularly across browsers and computers.&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/01/mediarecorder">MediaRecorder and captureStream</a>&nbsp;are the magic that allows us to create a Webm video from the components above. As of the writing of this document, Safari only supports MediaRecorder in experimental mode. Firefox does not support VP9 or H264 codecs. Chrome is our best friend here and clearly outperforms in this use case. With 70% market share between Chrome and Firefox, I was willing to move ahead with this approach betting that eventually Safari will make MediaRecorder generally available.</p>



<p>I am still tweaking the configuration here. It seems that both the VP9 and H264 codecs underperform VP8 for this application. Firefox has its issues. Adjusting both the frame rate of the animation and the captureStream combined with the optional videoBitsPerSecond parameter for the MediaRecorder seem to improve visual lag and artifacts due to compression. It’s not perfect but so far I am pleased with the results</p>

<h2>What’s next?</h2>



<p>With this technique, there really isn’t a limit to the types of you can create in the browser. With that said, by design, Vizibop will not evolve into a full blown video editor. A guiding principle is to keep the user experience simple while maximizing the number of unique videos that can be created. <strong>Awesome Factor = Number of Unique Videos / Number of Knobs and Dials</strong>. My intent is to create a tool that is&nbsp;very simple to use&nbsp;for people who I believe should be spending more time focused on their core craft.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>P</span>eople afflicted by Covid-19, particularly those with bad cases, experience difficulty breathing.&nbsp; We need oxygen in our tissues to keep our bodies working and our brains clear; viral damage to our lungs deprives bodies of this vital dissolved gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>	This oxygen-starved condition is called hypoxia, and itâ€™s also a serious condition in many parts of the worldâ€™s ocean, as well as in estuaries, lagoons, rivers, and lakes. Marine hypoxia receives much less public attention than ocean acidification or warming—but in many parts of the world its effects may be just as profound, and the problem is worsening.</p>
<p>	The causes of marine hypoxia are twofold. The first, which has been studied the most, is the too-much-of-a-good-thing problem of nutrient over-enrichment. Vast loads of nutrients are applied to farm fields as fertilizers, spill from our sewage and septic systems, and waft from the tailpipes of automobiles. Inevitably some of these make their way into water, stimulating blooms of tiny plankton that eventually die and decay.&nbsp;The process of decaying consumes the oxygen, and hypoxia ensues. Wastewater treatment plants have helped but are not enough. Some nutrient-loaded hypoxic waters are now-infamous â€œdead zones,â€� such as the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie most summers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The other major cause is global warming.&nbsp;Warmer water canâ€™t hold as much dissolved oxygen as colder water. Itâ€™s lighter, too, and therefore tends to float above cooler layers, cutting them off from atmospheric exchange so that they eventually become deoxygenated as well. This phenomenon isnâ€™t directly associated with nutrient over-enrichment, but can exacerbate and intensify dead zones and impact deep ocean waters that have few nutrients. Warming is a global problem affecting the oxygen status of all waters—and it also fuels blooms of algae that die and decay, again setting off the cycle of oxygen loss.</p>
<p>	The general public—and even many scientists—are unaware of the rapidly expanding scale of deoxygenation. Among the first researchers to describe it were marine ecologists Bob Diaz and Rutger Rosenberg, who in the 1980s began to study the impacts on bottom-dwelling organisms in estuaries and coastal seas. In 1995 they wrote, "There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen." &nbsp;</p>
<p>	In 2008, Diaz and Rosenberg published a landmark study in the journal <em>Science</em>, documenting over 400 such zones and showing that their growth was exponential.&nbsp;By 2019 their tally exceeded 700, and possibly as many as 1000, coastal dead zones.&nbsp;If we make a chart of the known history of increase and color-code it by Gross World Product, an index of global economic output, we can appreciate the linkage of these dead zones to human activity:</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_423219c2026b77bfba722aa122b966a6.jpg" alt="dead zones and GWP chart"><figcaption><span>Growth in the number of coastal marine ecosystems classified as â€œdead zonesâ€� by Diaz and Rosenberg (2008) and Diaz et al. (2019).  The colors indicate levels of Gross World Product (GWP), and show that as economic output has increased exponentially, so has the number of polluted, deoxygenated dead zones. </span><br><span>GWP data: World Bank and CIA Factbook (compiled in Wikipedia).</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation in open oceans, away from coasts, extends farther and deeper, and is largely caused by the aforementioned tendency of warm water to seal off the cool waters below. The extent and spread of these so-called oxygen minimum zones wasnâ€™t fully appreciated until around 15 years ago, when improved instrumentation allowed scientists to measure them.&nbsp;Ten years ago their total area was estimated at 8 percent of Earth's ocean surface area—11.7 million square miles altogether, an area larger than North America and comparable in size to the entire African continent. That area is expanding today.<br></p>
<p>Brief periods of hypoxia—or even no oxygen, a phenomenon called anoxia—are common in nature and many organisms adapt by moving away or going temporarily dormant.&nbsp;A very few species are exceptionally tolerant and even have specialized metabolic pathways to cope in these circumstances.&nbsp;As the scale of deoxygenation increases, however, we see low-oxygen events so large and long that even highly mobile organisms, like fish, canâ€™t always escape.&nbsp;Some may be able to survive but become so weak that they have difficulty moving and finding food, let alone digesting it.&nbsp;Think of the Covid-19 sufferers who are so exhausted from lack of oxygen that they can barely move.&nbsp;Itâ€™s the same basic issue.&nbsp;As scientists study the problem of marine deoxygenation, we are increasingly seeing the effects on everything from fish growth to reproductive impairment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most of the studies on biotic effects of deoxygenation have taken place in laboratories, my colleague Ben Walther and I, together with our students and colleagues, have learned to decipher signs of hypoxia exposure that are â€œrecordedâ€� in tiny bones within fish heads, called otoliths or ear-stones.&nbsp;These calcium carbonate deposits grow incrementally and take up various trace elements including the element manganese, which becomes available only at very low oxygen concentrations.&nbsp;By studying the lifetime uptake of manganese, biologist Michele Casini and I showed that periods of intense hypoxia have profound impacts on the growth and health of Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea. With less oxygen available, cod have less energy for foraging and fighting off parasites and infections. As a result, they are unhealthy and shrunken compared to cod living in better environments. By age three, cod with high levels of hypoxia exposure are one-third smaller than healthy cod from oxygen-rich waters. Multiply that by population size and you have an epic loss of biomass. This has direct economic consequences and likely causes enormous suffering for the fish themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_15b7f377d5e469878f05995df3610167.jpg" alt="Cod before-and-after"><figcaption><span>Left: Cod caught in 1981 off the island of Gotland, Sweden. Right: Cod caught in 2020 in the same vicinity. Baltic cod today are affected by several stressors, foremost among them hypoxia. </span><br><span>K. Limburg and Y. Heimbrand</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation impacts ripple through entire ecosystems, too.&nbsp;Recent work has shown that in large stretches of the ocean even zooplankton, the microscopic animals who feed fish, often live on the edge of metabolic collapse. A study in the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone found that zooplankton there migrate in and out of microhabitats with extremely low oxygen; they are among the most hypoxia-tolerant organisms, yet are already at their metabolic limits. Projected further declines in oxygen may put them over the edge, with important consequences for carbon cycling and other biogeochemical processes in the open ocean.&nbsp;Food webs become compromised, particularly those on sea bottoms; there are many documented cases of sensitive invertebrate communities falling victim to hypoxic events since they cannot flee. Hypoxia has even been found to cause mass mortality in coral reef ecosystems, and in some instances may play as important a role as the better-known culprit of elevated water temperatures. Even open-water ecosystems change as the volume of healthy habitat shrinks and species crowd together, leading to novel food-web interactions. Covid-19â€™s web of long-term complications presents an uncanny parallel.<br></p>
<p>	Fortunately for humanity, a vaccine for Covid-19 should be available in 2021.&nbsp;The outlook for the oceans is not so optimistic, but neither is it hopeless.&nbsp;Think about the initial response to the virus, which was hamstrung by shortages of necessary medical supplies and technology, including masks and respirators; once the issues were recognized, it became possible to prioritize production to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of coastal hypoxia, nutrient pollution reductions coupled with wetland and seagrass restoration are akin to masks and respirators. They help protect the ecosystems and build up their resiliency. Those approaches resulted in greatly improved water quality and subsequent return of biodiversity in the waters off Tampa Bay, Florida, for example. And after decades of nutrient management, some parts of the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay are beginning to show signs of recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The looming, elephant-in-the-room challenge is to deal with global warming, which will require new economic policies at national and global scales and the commitment of governments and citizens everywhere. Although overshadowed in the news cycle by Covid-19, global warming is still on the rise, fueled by human outputs of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;We <em>must</em> bend the curve on greenhouse gas emissions, just as we must flatten the Covid-19 curve. Without such change, we are headed in a dark, scary direction where nobody really wants to go.</p>

                    <p>85% of the data consumed over the internet is via videos. About 2.8 exabytes of data is transferred over the internet via streaming videos. This growth is driven by the advent of VOD platforms like Netflix, Video communication platforms like Zoom, Social platforms like Tiktok, esports, live streaming to name a few.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG_1.png 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG_2.png 1000w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/consumption.PNG 1135w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source :- https://www.peervadoo.com/</figcaption></figure><p>Covid19 pandemic has accelerated the video consumption and has been the driving force of companies moving from offline mode to online live mode. With this explosion of the video consumption on a day-to-day basis we need to be prepared for the upcoming demand. </p><p>In this article we will be discussing what are the latest advancements in video streaming technology and how can they help in improving the streaming experience.</p><h2 id="p2p-streaming"><a href="https://www.peervadoo.com/">P2P Streaming</a> &nbsp;</h2><p>Video streaming follows a client-server model. The content is delivered from edge locations called CDN which cache the content from the server. The client devices i.e the mobile/laptop/TV fetch the content from these CDN to start playing your video. Video streaming via CDN has a few limitations as mentioned below</p><ol><li>Video streaming using CDN is expensive</li><li>Viewership spike leads to high buffering</li><li>Delivery of content to remote locations due to poor coverage of CDN</li></ol><p>Due to these reasons it becomes difficult for a video streaming company to scale their service effectively and to provide a good user experience. All of these problems can be solved by extending a CDN with P2P streaming aka Hybrid CDN</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/Server-based-vs-P2P-network.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/Server-based-vs-P2P-network_1.jpg 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/Server-based-vs-P2P-network.jpg 601w"><figcaption>Source :- <a href="https://www.wowza.com/resources/guides/p2p-unicast-streaming">https://www.wowza.com/resources/guides/p2p-unicast-streaming</a></figcaption></figure><p>Adding <a href="https://www.peervadoo.com/">Peer-to-Peer</a> layer over the traditional CDN reduces the load on the main CDN by distributing the content from neighboring peers which act like a CDN themselves thus bringing the edge much closer to the user. Due to less load on CDN, the expenses will now be 40% less while the user experience improves as well due to low re-buffering as the content is fetched from a nearby peer than a far-away CDN. More info about how the technology works is available <a href="https://blog.peervadoo.com/what-is-vadoo.html">here</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->







<p><a href="https://www.peervadoo.com/?ref=vadoo_blog">Scale your video streaming with Vadoo</a></p><h2 id="super-resolution">Super-Resolution </h2><p>Artificial Intelligence has been disrupting all kinds of industries and video streaming is no exception. AI models can learn how to generate a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image by learning from a lot of images. This method of generating a high-res image from a low-res image is called Super-Resolution</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/3c7d17d9-68f1-49fa-9a5f-9c5fef10cac9.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/3c7d17d9-68f1-49fa-9a5f-9c5fef10cac9_1.jpeg 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/3c7d17d9-68f1-49fa-9a5f-9c5fef10cac9.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Super-Resolution comes under the realm of generative algorithms where the algorithm has the ability to generate information which is not present before. As can be seen in the above figure, the network can take the image from the left and imagine the finer details to re-create the image on the right. This is possible because the AI models have been trained on lots of data of images and it now has an understanding of how to upscale the image when a new image has been provided. </p><p>The same concept can be extended for videos with minor modifications. In the case of videos, multiple generated high-resolution frames of the past and the current low resolution frame are used together to generate the current high-resolution frame but nevertheless the concept is same. This technology provides the capability to send a video at 480p but to watch on the client device at say 1080p. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm_2.jpg 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm_1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm_3.jpg 1600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/D3pbnCyXoAI_Ynm.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source :- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09393.pdf</figcaption></figure><p>This technology is possible due to the recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of huge compute power at client devices. A recent paper <strong>TecoGAN</strong> has produced high-resolution results which are eerily similar to the real-world images as can be seen in image above. Using this technology can save up-to 30% of the bandwidth consumption thus improving the overall user experience.</p><h2 id="multi-cdn"><a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/multi_cdn">Multi-CDN</a></h2><p>We have seen that content is delivered to client devices via CDN which cache the content from the server. A CDN consists of data-centers located at multiple locations to serve content. These locations are called Point-of-Presence(POP). Ideally we would want to have as many POP's as possible. But not all CDN's have equal reach worldwide. For example some of the most popular CDN doesn't even have a single POP in China.</p><p>In addition, the performance of every CDN varies with time and is inconsistent.A CDN can have an outage at any point of time due to Murphy's law. To deal with all these risks, an ideal option would be to have access to multiple CDN at a time. This can either be done by reaching out to multiple CDN and cutting deals with each of them individually or instead reach out to a <a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/multi_cdn">Multi-CDN provider</a> who manages all of this for you.</p><p>Powering your video streaming service using a Multi-CDN provides you with the advantages which help in improving the overall user experience. </p><ol><li>Prevention of sudden stoppage of service by switching to a working CDN</li><li>Fetching content from the highest performing CDN at that point of time using Real User Monitoring(RUM) metrics to improve Quality of Service(QOS)</li><li>Mid-stream switching can help in reducing CDN costs</li></ol><h2 id="cmaf">CMAF</h2><p>Live streaming a sports match would have a delay of 25-30 seconds than a television broadcast thus impeding user experience. This is due to the way the technology around video streaming is designed. The most prominent way of streaming videos is HTTP based streaming, where the video content is delivered in the following steps</p><ol><li>The video is encoded with a codec say h264 to reduce the video file size</li><li>Then the video is converted to a streamable format like HLS or MPEG-DASH</li><li>The content from the server is now distributed via CDN</li><li>The video player buffers few segments of the video before starting to play</li></ol><p>HLS or MPEG-DASH allows sending the videos in segments which are downloaded sequentially by the video player. A segment generally contains around 10 seconds of video. The encoder has to wait for encoding the entire segment of the video before making it available for CDN. The CDN has to wait for receiving the entire segment of video before passing it across to the video player. The video player has to buffer atleast few segments of video before it starts playing to maintain user experience.</p><p>This entire process leads to a delay of 25-30 seconds. Also due to the presence of multiple formats i.e .ts fr HLS and .mp4 of MPEG-DASH there is a need for double the storage, double the encoding and double the CDN. CMAF tries to solve both the above problems.</p><p>CMAF provides a consistent format fragment mp4(fmp4) which is supported by both HLS and MPEG-DASH. It also has the capability of doing chunked transfer encoding. What this means is, the encoder won't be waiting for the entire segment of video before transmitting. The segment is further divided into smaller chunks and these chunks are sent as and when encoded which is passed on by the CDN to encoder in no particular order. The video player takes care of organizing the chunks and playing the video segment.</p><p>Thus CMAF helps in reducing the encoding and storage costs as well as reducing the latency using chunked transfer encoding.</p><h2 id="per-title-encoding">Per-title encoding </h2><p>Video encoding is the process of compressing video using codecs like H.264 which take advantage of common information present across consecutive frames and thus only storing the newly added information in the frame. To deal with a variety of network conditions and volatile internet connections the video content is encoded at multiple resolutions and is intelligently switched. This technique is called Adaptive Bitrate(ABR). &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP_1.png 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP_2.png 1000w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/R8QVP.png 1216w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The below image depicts multiple resolutions and the corresponding bitrate allocated. The key-factor to observe here is that the content at the same resolution can be encoded at multiple bitrates i.e a 1920 x 1080 video can be encoded at 5800 mbps or 6800 mbps or even 4800 mbps. This is due to the fact that video compression is a lossy compression and hence the lesser the chosen bitrate the lesser the information available in the compressed video. This can be observed in the encoding artifacts similar to the image above which you would have observed while you watch a video on a streaming platform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/1_tCdB8E0X6zDJKAhpTLxNBA.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/1_tCdB8E0X6zDJKAhpTLxNBA_1.png 600w, https://blog.peervadoo.com/images/1_tCdB8E0X6zDJKAhpTLxNBA.png 633w"><figcaption>Source :- https://netflixtechblog.com/per-title-encode-optimization-7e99442b62a2</figcaption></figure><p>Now that we know we can encode a video at a particular resolution using different bitrates, in real-world an ideal generic bitrate is chosen such that there would lesser artifacts while not consuming a lot of bandwidth. The above picture shows a generic bandwidth pattern which is chosen for all videos. But there is a problem with this one size fits all approach. Some of the videos such as high octane action films might have rich information and thus might need a higher bitrate for encoding while a simple cartoon video can perform the same even with a lower bitrate.</p><p>Thus Netflix proposed encoding a particular video resolution at multiple bitrates and then choosing the best bitrate which can render the video without artifacts. This is done using a metric called VMAF which is a visual score to identify the quality of rendered video. With the help of this, custom bitrate ladders can be designed for each video. Thus if we are streaming a cartoon video, it can be published at a lower bitrate while still having similar quality whereas the action film can be published at a higher bitrate without any artifacts and thus improving user experience. </p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>To summarize we have seen multiple techniques which can help scaling, improve user experience and reduce latency in video streaming.The advent of 5G and the world of Virtual Reality(VR) and Augmented Reality(AR) and the rise of esports will skyrocket video bandwidth consumption. Thus it is time for the adoption of the latest technologies to catch up and service this growth.</p><h2 id="vadoo-s-p2p-and-multi-cdn-solution">Vadoo's P2P and Multi-CDN solution</h2><p>We at Vadoo are disrupting the video streaming industry using <a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/register?ref=vadoo_blog">hybrid P2P streaming</a> and <a href="https://api.peervadoo.com/multi_cdn?ref=vadoo_blog">Multi-CDN</a>.

  <p>I had been a happy-go Java developer on Windows platform. And then I had to ride the Ruby-on-Rails wave over Linux platform, only to realize how much I didn't know about productivity with automation. Later I moved onto MacOS to experience bliss before starting to hate it for one thing after the other; right from their buggy operating system upgrades to Apple not providing power cable compatible to Indian market resulting in earthing issues. Out of frustration I jumped back to Ubuntu and now back on Windows after long years.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting onto Windows was more out of necessity than interest and I started to explore how much things have changed in the Windows world. It wasn't a smooth return for me but the teething period is over and I'm loving Windows again. If you are onto Windows 10 Pro edition, and wanting to get the best of both worlds (Windows and Linux), this post is for you. I am jotting down ProTips to experience delight and productivity at development work.</p>
<ol><li>Use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1, for the former is far less resource intensive by integrating natively with Windows 10 Hyper-V virtualization stack, and thus phenomenally faster too. If you are on Windows 10 Home edition, you need to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro edition and it is worth it, for you can get it at half the price upon upgrade.</li><li>Do not mount windows native formatted drive (NTFS) onto WSL for code that can be developed both in WSL environment and Windows. While this works, it is snail paced and you will frustrated too soon. I tried this out of curiosity and frustrated beyond my anticipation. If you are still wanting this, you will have to first format the storage drive in DOS format (as FAT32), so that it works well with your WSL and host Windows operating systems. This is possible the best middle-ground that you can hit upon.</li><li>Use <a href="https://aka.ms/terminal" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/09/Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank">Mintty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> or any other console emulators. Why? You can customize it with default settings for each of WSLs, Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or other terminals integrated with it. Also Windows Terminal is lightweight and faster.</li><li>When you start your development server in WSL 2, try testing it in your browser with <b><i>localhost</i></b>, it won't work. WSL is one proper sandboxed environment or VM. You need to port forward localhost settings for this to work. This can be done by adding the line like below in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file in your windows <b><i>$HOME</i></b> directory.<br>--
 --<br>
 </li><li>WSL 2 can consume all of your host memory. You can set limits to it by appending the line&nbsp;<b><i>memory=16GB</i></b> in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file.</li><li>Do install <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-ZSH</a> to use zsh shell instead of the default bash. You get bunch of goodies like pre-configured aliases for Git and more by way of its plugins that you can configure to your preference.</li><li>If you are into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a>, you can use that too in your WSL 2, and power it up with <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline" target="_blank">tmux-powerline</a>.</li><li>You can change the location of your WSL 2 distribution's virtual hard drive.&nbsp;I keep all of my VMs (and now WSL 2 virtual hard drives) in <b><i>D:\VMs\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;distribution name&gt;</i></b>. Run the following commands in PowerShell - replacing distribution name and preferred location: <br>----<br> Also at the time of writing, when you import a distribution, you may need to tell WSL 2 to start the distribution using the Linux user account you created when you first created the distribution. Thanks to <a href="https://www.58bits.com/blog/2020/05/30/wsl-2-setup-development">58bits.com </a> that you can run the below PowerShell script that imports the distribution, and resets the default user as you would like it to be. <br>-- --<br> Note that if your import fails with 'Unspecified error' (or other) - you may need to limit the amount of memory allocated to <b><i>vmmem</i></b>. You can do this with WSL2 config to limit memory as mentioned in ProTip 5 above.</li><li>If you are into using VS-Code as your IDE for development, you can launch the one you installed on your host Windows 10 OS from WSL 2 bash in your project's root folder and executing <b><i>`code .`</i></b>. With this you can work on your windows operating system launching your development servers in WSL environment, thus getting the best of both the worlds. Additionally, you can install your vs-code extensions on remote wsl as well as on host OS, all from within your IDE.</li><li>And <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> works well with your WSL2 too. You just can extract the best from everything.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Windows 10 is super cool again with WSL 2. Whether you are a Windows buff wanting to leverage Linux goodies, or a Linux buff wanting to draw upon Windows 10 strengths, you can have it all. Happy coding!!..

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p><img src="https://blog.darrien.dev/fireworks-for-your-terminal/fireworks.gif" alt="fireworks display"></p>
<p>Recently I embarked on a fun little side project. There have been just too many
rampant fireworks going on outside and I was feeling a little left out, so I
decided to make some of my own.</p>
<p>Given I have no experience with anything like OpenGL at all, and was feeling
like learning <a href="https://crates.io/crates/termion">termion</a> since I
consistently use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tui">tui</a> with a termion backend and
only sort of understand how it works, I decided terminal fireworks would be the
way to go.</p>
<p>This little post traces my short journey to making my own terminal fireworks in
case you want to do it yourself and some logical extensions if you want to keep
building it afterwards. All code is in rust because rust.</p>
<p>If you are using rust and following along, you’ll probably want these
dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>dependencies</span>]
<span>termion</span> = <span>"1.5.5"</span>
<span>rand</span> = <span>"0.7"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This little doc provides some code, but does not give all the code required to
make it work. For that, you’ll need to write it yourself 😎</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks">My final result is here</a></p>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up<a href="#setting-up" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>When working with applications that have UIs, you almost always want to have
your rendering separate from input. I didn’t know how to do this for my terminal
typeracer application and it has <a href="https://gitlab.com/ttyperacer/terminal-typeracer/-/issues/2">haunted me ever
since</a>. <a href="https://gitlab.com/ttyperacer/terminal-typeracer">Terminal
typeracer</a> still works fine
without it since it only needs to update on keypress (for now at least), but for
an application meant to exclusively work with graphics that stops when you hit a
key, async rendering was required.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-async-rendering-pipeline">A simple async rendering pipeline<a href="#a-simple-async-rendering-pipeline" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Supposedly there is an <a href="https://docs.rs/termion/1.5.5/termion/fn.async_stdin.html">async stdin
directive</a> termion
provides, but it feels way too magical, so I ended up doing this manually. Plus
it’s a good learning experience, so two for one!</p>
<p>The first part of actually rendering with termion is that you need to steal
stdout. Then somewhere else, steal stdin and read and process events as they
come in.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> std::io::{stdin, stdout, Error};
<span>use</span> termion::{event::<span>*</span>, input::TermRead};

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; Result<span>&lt;</span>Box<span>&lt;</span>dyn Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> {
  <span>// steal stdout, we can do stuff with it later
</span><span></span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> stdout <span>=</span> stdout().into_raw_mode()<span>?</span>;

  <span>// steal stdin, C-c will break out of the loop
</span><span></span>  <span>for</span> c <span>in</span> stdin().events() {
  <span>let</span> evt <span>=</span> c<span>?</span>;
  <span>match</span> evt {
    Event::Key(Key::Ctrl(<span>'c'</span>)) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>break</span>,
    _ <span>=&gt;</span> {}
  }

}
</code></pre></div><p>Now one of these has to go in a separate thread. If you’re like me, you might
think it makes more sense to have the rendering work go on a separate thread.
Unfortunately as I found out, this is a very bad idea.</p>
<p>Termion sets the terminal to raw mode and if you release the handle to raw mode
in another thread, the terminal will never look the same at the end. It will
switch the terminal out of raw mode, but there will be all sorts of character
aberrations. I tried all sorts of weird ways to get around this because I
thought it made more sense, but take my word for it here, it’s impossible.</p>
<p>So let’s set this up so it up so your terminal does not look evil when it’s
done.</p>
<p>The first step is really just spinning up a thread and setting up a receiver so
the two threads can chat. I’m using rust’s standard
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/">mpsc</a> for this. It works much like
Go’s channels. This is required since we’ll need a way to ask the renderer to
terminate from our stdin thread.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> std::{
  io::{stdin, stdout, Error},
  sync::{
    mpsc,
    mpsc::{Receiver, Sender},
  },
  thread,
};
<span>use</span> termion::{event::<span>*</span>, input::TermRead};


<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
  <span>let</span> (tx, rx): (Sender<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>, Receiver<span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> mpsc::channel();
  thread::spawn(<span>||</span> capture_input(rx));
  render(rx);
}

<span>// capture keystrokes and ask renderer to stop when ^C is hit
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>capture_input</span>(sender: <span>Sender</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) { ... }

<span>// render fireworks display every so often
</span><span></span>render(receiver: <span>Receiver</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>) { ... }
</code></pre></div><p>With just those few lines of code you’re off to the races. Async stdin! While I
haven’t checked, I’m fairly certain this is exactly how termion’s implementation
works.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-keypresses">Capturing keypresses<a href="#capturing-keypresses" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The implementation is not novel or interesting. <a href="https://gitlab.com/DarrienG/term-fireworks/-/blob/73f52c5f7ea85e6e14d05a66921e823342f052f3/src/input.rs">The whole thing is 18
lines</a>
and when it captures a <code>C-c</code>, it asks the renderer to stop.</p>

<p>The rest of this will talk about the rendering pipeline, and the design of
making a fun terminal firework render.</p>
<h2 id="firework-setup">Firework Setup<a href="#firework-setup" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Fireworks aren’t stagnant, they move around, shimmy and shine, and do all sorts
of funky stuff. For our naive firework implementation, we’ll want to define some
states our firework can get in, and we can handle each differently.</p>
<p>For my basic fireworks, I decided these were a reasonable set of states:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>FireworkState</span> {
  Flying,    <span>// Just a tail - going up
</span><span></span>  Exploding, <span>// Bursting outwards
</span><span></span>  Falling,   <span>// bursting out has stopped, fall from the tips and fade from center to tips
</span><span></span>  Fading,    <span>// tips disappear to fading at 2x the rate fade falls
</span><span></span>  Gone,      <span>// nothing, a blank canvas, the inner machinations of my mind
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>We’ll then want each firework to have a set of these states until there is
naught but Gone left.</p>
<p>We can generate these on the fly, or we can do it all at once up front. I found
it a little more convenient to generate them all up front, and at some point I’d
be interested in making a backwards/forwards control on my fireworks, so that’s
what I went with.</p>
<p>For the sake of testing I wanted the fireworks to be consistent, but for the
sake of 🎉 fun 🎉 I wanted them to be random. The compromise was using seeded
random.</p>
<p>It was one of the first times I’d ever manually seeded a rand value besides one
time I had to use C++ in college. Rust doesn’t make it too hard though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> rand::StdRng;

<span>// make a new firework
</span><span></span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(seed: <span>u64</span>) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
  <span>let</span> rng <span>=</span> StdRng::seed_from_u64(seed);
  <span>// who care
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Using this seed, we are able to now ensure all random values are generated
deterministically.</p>
<p><em>Note: rng objects are mutable and work kind of like iterators. If we
decide to only pass the seed around, all fireworks would be generated
identically, thus we want to pass around the cloned rng object to get an
increased level of randomness.</em></p>
<p>Finally we set some random thresholds, generate a list of states for our
firework object, and we’re off to the races.</p>
<h2 id="each-phase-and-how-they-are-rendered">Each phase and how they are rendered<a href="#each-phase-and-how-they-are-rendered" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Now that we have each of our firework phases clearly defined, it’s time to talk
about what each one does at a lower level.</p>
<h2 id="the-center">The center<a href="#the-center" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>This is the smallest part, and not even a phase, but worth mentioning because
most everything will use it for absolute or relative positioning. Before
anything is really made, I decide the firework starting point (I also use it as
the center).  It’s just a point with an y value of 0, and an x value of
<code>range(0, u64::MAX)</code></p>
<h3 id="were-soaring-flying">(We’re Soaring…) Flying<a href="#were-soaring-flying" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Flying is the most simple of the components. It starts with a single point:</p>
<pre><code>*
</code></pre><p>And after each phase, it grows one up. So:</p>
<p>Two phases:</p>
<pre><code>*
*
</code></pre><p>Three phases:</p>
<pre><code>*
*
*
</code></pre><p>Very simple.</p>
<p>I considered making the bottom of the tail shrink ever 2 or 3 phases, but
figured it was unnecessary because of the next phase.</p>
<h3 id="exploding">Exploding<a href="#exploding" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Exploding is more fun and takes a little more effort. But let’s do the simple
stuff first.</p>
<p>The exploding action should make the tail shrink by one from the bottom. This
helps signify the explosion is starting.</p>
<p>The actual exploding part is a little more complex though. Given the low pixel
nature of a terminal, I decided the best way forward was to explode out two
different sections at different intervals. The cross section was to be exploded
on every exploding interval, while diagonal exploding out points were to happen
every two intervals.</p>
<p>For instance…
(note, spaces added because my font thinks *** is a ligature)</p>
<p>Phase 1:</p>
<pre><code>  *
* * *
  *
</code></pre><p>Phase 2:</p>
<pre><code>    *
  * * *
* * * * *
  * * *
    *
</code></pre><p>Phase 3:</p>
<pre><code>     *
     *
   * * *
* * * * * *
   * * *
     *
     *
</code></pre><p>Phase 4:</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *  *  *
     * * *
* * * * * * * *
     * * *
   *   *   *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>You can see it looks a little bit awkward for tiny explosions, and starts to
look more normal around phase 4. Phase 4+ looks like a nice little explosion and
works much better with falling as you’ll see when there are staggered cross and
diagonal explosions.</p>
<h3 id="falling">Falling<a href="#falling" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>At this point the tail should be gone, but if it isn’t, we remove it. Good
riddance.</p>
<p>We also begin to collapse the explosion inward.</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *  *  *
     *   *
* * *     * * *
     *   *
   *   *   *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>With each phase removing from the inside out until the edges are reached.</p>
<p>This too follows the two phased cross =&gt; cross + diagonal =&gt; cross =&gt; …</p>
<p>Falling isn’t called falling because the inside of the fireworks collapses though,
it also falls!</p>
<p>It’s a little hard to show without extra color with the last diagram, so I will
show a fully collapsed explosion to illustrate.</p>
<pre><code>       *
        
    *     *
          
*             *
          
   *       *
        
       *
</code></pre><p>This is what a fully collapsed firework (with no falling steps yet) looks like.
For falling, each of these points draws downward, like an inverse tail.</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *     *
    *     *
*             *
*             *
   *       *
   *       *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>With a not fully collapsed firework, this looks extra cool. Let’s add two more
to fully show the effect.</p>
<pre><code>       *
       *
    *  *  *
    *  *  *
*   *     *   *
*   *     *   *
*  *       *  *
*  *       *  *
   *   *   *
   *   *   *
       *
       *
</code></pre><p>Pretty neat, right?</p>
<p>This strategy sort of looks a little funky when working with smaller explosions,
but works quite well for explosions of size 4 and larger.</p>
<h2 id="fading">Fading<a href="#fading" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Finally comes fading (well technically Gone is the last step, but it just
deletes everything, so it isn’t worth talking about).</p>
<p>Fading is quite simple. We take the end points from the explosion:</p>
<pre><code>       *
        
    *     *
          
*             *
          
   *       *
        
       *
</code></pre><p>And delete from those, to the final point we created during the Falling phase 1
at a time.</p>
<p>This goes on for as long as we generated falling states for.</p>
<p>Eventually your firework disappears and that’s it!</p>

<p>So now we’ve defined the firework and its stages. We have more or less
implemented a firework, how are we going to get it onto a user’s screen?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">
                <p>We’ve been using runc at work in production for a while now and although it seemed somewhat obscure at first, we’ve come around to being used to it so much so that it seems more intuitive than docker. I wanted to write this blogpost as a gentle introduction to runc for folks who want to try it out. This blogpost will try to serve as a quick primer on getting started with runc i.e. managing a container lifecycle with runc.</p>


<p>runc is a lightweight portable container runtime parts of which were internally used by Docker and were packaged as a single binary and released as an open source project under the the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) as a way of giving back to the community[1]. Explained simply, runc is a lightweight tool written in Go which helps manage a container’s lifecycle i.e creating, running, killing and deleting a container. You’ll go through each of these steps in this post and see how runc differs from Docker when it comes to running containers.</p>

<p>You’ll work with the official golang docker image as a running example for the purpose of this article. You can find more details about this image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/golang">Docker Hub</a>.</p>


<p>Unlike docker, runc doesn’t abstract tedious tasks under the hood and rather expects you to arrange whatever is it that is required for it to work. Let’s run through the requirements:</p>

<h2 id="runc-binary">runc Binary</h2>
<p>runc is a portable piece of software, for GNU/Linux users, it’s as simple as fetching the binary and giving execute permissions to it in order to work with runc:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>curl <span>-L</span> <span>-o</span> /usr/bin/runc https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc10/runc.amd64 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>chmod</span> +x /usr/bin/runc</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can head over to the project’s <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">release page</a> to download other versions. It’s also worth noting that runc doesn’t work on macOS so if you are on a Mac, your best bet is to run runc inside a docker container.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-spec">runtime-spec</h2>
<p>Specifying configuration options such as volume mounts, memory limits or uid:gid mapping while running a container with docker is as simple as specifying command line options to the docker command. While using runc, these configurations are passed to runc as a file. This configuration file, the runtime-spec, is a configuration standard put in place by the Open Container Initiative (OCI) to specify options for a container and is used by runc[2]. In simpler words, the runtime-spec is a JSON file named <code>config.json</code> consisting of configurations pertaining to a specific container.</p>

<p>You’ll go through a few attributes in the runtime-spec in this post to get enough understanding so as to be able to run containers. Later sections will focus on attributes which require further explanation. Consider this sample runtime-spec snippet:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

		"</span><span>noNewPrivileges</span><span>": true
	},
    ...
}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>runc expects the configuration file in the exact same format with a certain required fields and a few other optional ones. You might have figured out a few options from the snippet above alone for instance, the environment variables, the current working directory and the uid:gid mapping. There are other configuration options which give you more control over how the container should perform that you’ll go through in the sections to follow.</p>

<h2 id="root-filesystem">Root filesystem</h2>
<p>This is exactly what it sounds like, root filesystem for the container. There are multiple ways you can get hold of a root filesystem from a Docker image but the easiest and the one advised by the OCI is using <code>docker export</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>docker <span>export</span> <span>$(</span>docker create golang<span>)</span> | <span>tar</span> <span>-C</span> rootfs <span>-xvf</span> -</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will generate the unarchived root filesystem for our golang docker image which you’ll now use to create containers using runc.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve gathered up the required prerequisites, you can now go ahead and run containers using runc.</p>


<p>Before running the container, you’ve to make sure you have all the prerequisites in the required manner. The <code>runc</code> binary, by default, looks for the root filesystem and the runtime-spec in a directory which is referred to as a “bundle”. The bundle directory must have the runtime-spec(config.json) and the root filesystem(rootfs) in order for runc to work.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">~/golang
.
├── config.json
└── rootfs/
      ├── home/
      ├── tmp/
      ├── ..
      └── ..</code></pre></figure>

<p>As shown above, having such a directory, you’ll be able to run runc commands in the <code>~/golang</code> directory for it to work appropriately.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, you can go ahead and create the container:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span>runc create golang

<span># list active containers</span>
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          created     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:23:46.7358607Z   root

<span># starts running the user-defined command inside the container</span>
<span>$ </span>runc start golang

<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:23:46.7358607Z   root

<span># creates and starts the container</span>
<span>$ </span>runc run <span>-d</span> golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root</code></pre></figure>

<p>Contrary to the title of this section, there are multiple commands to “spin up” a container using runc. In the snippet above, we used the following commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>create</code>: creates an instance of the container from the bundle but it doesn’t run the command specified as an entrypoint in the runtime-spec(config.json).</li>
  <li><code>start</code>: runs the init command(specified in the runtime-spec) for a created container. This essentially means your container is now “running”. Your application or whatever command you’re running inside the container can now respond to requests or do the job you intend it to do.</li>
  <li><code>run</code>: it creates and starts the container. Passing a <code>-d</code> will run the container in detached mode. You’ll be using this command more frequently than individually creating and then starting the container.</li>
  <li><code>list</code>: lists containers you’ve created, they could be running, paused, stopped or in created state. (not an exhaustive list of states). This is most useful to inquire about the current status of the containers that you’ve started or stopped with runc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can now “spin up” containers with runc, killing or deleting containers with runc is also fairly straightforward.</p>


<p>Once you’ve started the container and played around with it, you need to discard it in such a manner that it does not run in the background holding onto resources or populating your pid tables for virtually no reason.</p>

<p>Although there’s no <code>stop</code> command provided by runc, the <code>runc kill</code> command, when run without any options, sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to the init process of the container thereby stopping the container. This moves the container to a <code>stopped</code> state. Your container might still be holding on to certain resources used by processes contained by your container though. As a side not, while you’re at the topic of killing of processes inside containers, it’s worthwhile to go through issues associated with handling of <a href="https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/">zombie processes in docker</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>runc delete</code> command frees up any resources that a container is holding on to thereby completely removing the container. You won’t be able to inspect this container in any way (checking filesystem or otherwise), and it will not show up when you do <code>runc list</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># creates and starts the container</span>
<span>$ </span>runc run <span>-d</span> golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root

<span>$ </span>runc <span>kill </span>golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          stopped     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root

<span>$ </span>runc delete golang
<span>$ </span>runc list</code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ve sent a signal to a running container and then released any resources held by that container in stopped state to completely “stop it”. Read more about additional options you can use with these commands by running <code>runc &lt;command&gt; --help</code>.</p>

<p>You can now manage a container using runc, you’ll take it one step further and see how you can checkpoint/restore a container with runc.</p>


<p>Similar to docker, runc provides a handy functionality to checkpoint/restore running containers. You can think of checkpointing a container as serializing the state of a running process and then storing the contents on disk. This serialized blob has all the metadata required to restore the process to the same point from when it was checkpointed at a later point in time. That’s an extremely simplified explanation of how criu works. It’s a lot more complex than it sounds but it’s adequate for the purpose of this article.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, runc uses <code>criu</code>, an open source piece of software which does the actual checkpoint and restore. In order to use runc commands such as <code>checkpoint</code> and <code>restore</code>, you ought to have the criu binary installed on your host system. You can find instruction for installing criu <a href="https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu">here</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># run the container in detached mode</span>
<span>$ </span>runc run <span>-d</span> golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root

<span>$ </span>runc checkpoint golang

<span>$ </span>runc restore golang
<span>$ </span>runc list
ID              PID         STATUS      BUNDLE          CREATED                        OWNER
golang          39          running     ~/golang        2020-04-12T14:26:46.7358607Z   root</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above snippet, you checkpoint the golang container while it was running. When you checkpoint a container, <code>criu</code> stores the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span lang="EN-AU">IBM made some announcements today relating to
their latest POWER7 server offerings. The new line of systems includes new
entry level systems and the highly anticipated high-end system, the POWER7 <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&amp;infotype=an&amp;appname=iSource&amp;supplier=897&amp;letternum=ENUS110-158">795</a>!
<span></span>They also officially outlined some of
the new features available in AIX 7.1. You can review the details <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/cgi-bin/common/ssi/ssialias?infotype=an&amp;subtype=ca&amp;htmlfid=897/ENUS210-200&amp;appname=isource&amp;language=enus">here</a>.
Ive discussed some of these new features </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/aix_7_open_beta_is_live_it_s_time_to_test?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
and </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/cgaix/entry/creating_an_aix_5_2_wpar_on_aix_7?lang=en"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
The official AIX 7.1 announcement details are available </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/news/announcement/20100817_annc.html"><span>here</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The announcement got me thinking about my
recent customer engagements and why some have chosen to deploy AIX into their
IBM POWER environments, while others are considering a Linux on POWER solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Ive found that it usually comes down to a
skills decision more than anything else. Most customers are happy to either
continue working with AIX (if they are existing AIX users) or migrate from
another UNIX OS to AIX. Ive seen very few customers actually migrate to Linux
on POWER, but Ive worked with several that have seriously considered it. Those
that have chosen to deploy Linux are doing so purely because they have in-house
Linux skills. They are concerned that migrating to AIX may be too big a jump
for their technical staff. I find this thinking interesting, as most of the
customers Ive dealt with who run other UNIX OSs like Tru64, Solaris or HP-UX
are more than happy to migrate to AIX. They believe the move is relatively
minor and doesnt require massive re-training of their UNIX admins. I tend to
agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For me, <b>AIX</b>
is my preferred Enterprise class UNIX Operating System. Notice Im prefacing
this with the words <b><i>Enterprise class</i></b>. Dont get me wrong, I have worked with Linux
systems in both small and large customer environments. It is a great OS. But
Ive found that it really only fits into environments that have a relatively
small number of users and where significant downtime can be tolerated for
things like operating system maintenance. This doesnt fit the Enterprise class
of UNIX server OSs that Im thinking of here. When I contemplate the word <i>Enterprise</i>, I think of servers and
operating systems that can respond to business demands in terms of performance,
reliability, stability and availability. An Enterprise UNIX can provide all of
these things without compromise. Linux can offer performance and reliability
(in my opinion). However, from what Ive seen, it lacks features &amp; functions
in the areas of stability and availability. AIX on the other hand ticks all the
boxes. Again, this is just my opinion based on my experiences with both AIX and
Linux in the Enterprise landscape. Others will no doubt have their own
experiences that may or may not match my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">So when Im designing an Enterprise UNIX
server environment for a customer, I always start with an AIX on POWER base. If
the customer wants Linux, sure I can look at that too, but I strongly recommend
AIX as my preferred choice for large systems. Most of my customers are running
relatively large SAP/Oracle systems. AIX on POWER is a great combination for
large Enterprise systems. If you need to deploy large database systems that
must service tens of thousands of users (like a big SAP system), then I believe
AIX is the perfect OS on which to provide a platform for these large scale
systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX is a very mature and powerful UNIX OS. It
has been a major player in the UNIX server market for over 20 years (as shown
below). Some people are just not aware of how mature, robust and stable the AIX
OS has become over the years. There are many impressive aspects of the OS in
the areas of performance, scalability, reliability, management and
administration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p></o:p></span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/cgaix/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/aix_evolution.gif"></a> </p>





<p><span lang="EN-AU">Just looking at some of the administration
capabilities built into AIX are enough for me to always recommend AIX over
Linux (or any other UNIX OS), when it comes to large Enterprise servers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">For example, the System Management Interface Tool (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-smit/index.html"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">) can make the UNIX admins life a lot simpler.
This is an interactive tool that is part of the AIX OS. Almost all tasks that
an AIX administrator may need to perform can be executed using this tool. It is
a text-based tool (there is also an X interface but I recommend sticking with
the text-based menus). Everything it does, it does through standard AIX
commands and Korn shell functions. This feature is especially useful when you
need to automate a repetitive task; you can have SMIT create the proper
command-line sequence, and you can then use those commands in your own script.
My compatriot, Anthony English, has a nice intro to </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://gibsonnet.net/blog/AIXDownUnder/entry/smitty_to_his_friends20?lang=en"><span>SMIT</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> on his AIX blog. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The
<b>AIX Logical Volume Manager</b> (</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0106.pdf"><span>LVM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">)
is built into the OS, for free. AIX LVM helps UNIX system administrators </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aixstorage/index.html"><span>manage their
storage</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU"> in a very flexible manner. LVM allows logical
volumes to span multiple physical volumes. Data on logical volumes appears to
be contiguous to the user, but might not be contiguous on the physical volume.
This allows file systems, paging space, and other logical volumes to be resized
or relocated, span multiple physical volumes, and have their contents
replicated for greater flexibility and availability. It provides capabilities
for mirroring data across disks, migrating data across disks &amp; storage
subsystems, expand/shrink filesystems and more.......all of which can be
performed dynamically.....<b>no downtime</b>
required. The concept, implementation and interface to the AIX LVM is one of a
kind. All of its features support the continuous availability philosophy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">One of the biggest reasons that I love AIX
over Linux is the <b>mksysb</b>. Its built
into the OS and allows you to create a bootable image of your AIX system. This
image can be used to restore a broken AIX system or for cloning other systems.
The cloning feature is truly amazing. You can take an image created on a
low-end system and deploy it on any POWER system, all the way up to the
high-end POWER boxes. This simplifies the installation and cloning processing
when you need to install and manage many AIX LPARs. By using an SOE mksysb
image you can deploy consistent AIX images across your Enterprise POWER server
environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">This brings me to another wonderful feature of
AIX, the <b>Network Installation Manager</b>
(</span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247296.html?Open"><span>NIM</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">).
NIM is powerful network installation tool (comparable to Linux Kickstart).
Using NIM you can backup/restore, update and upgrade one or more AIX systems
either individually or simultaneously. This can all be achieved over a network
connection, removing the need for handling physical installation media forever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Another fine example of AIXs superior OS management tools is </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/aix/aprilmay08/tipstechniques/20226p1.aspx"><span>multibos</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">. This tool allows an AIX administrator to
create and maintain two separate, bootable instances of the AIX OS within the
same root volume group (rootvg). This second instance of rootvg is known as a
standby Base Operating System (BOS) and is an extremely handy tool for
performing AIX TL and Service Pack (SP) updates. Multibos lets you install,
update and customize a standby instance of the AIX OS <b>without impacting</b> the running and active production instance of the
AIX OS. This is valuable in environments with tight maintenance windows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">When it comes to upgrading the OS to a new
release of AIX, the </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-migrate_nimadm/index.html"><span>nimadm</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">
utility can assist the administrator greatly in this task. </span><span lang="EN-AU">The <b><span>nimadm</span></b>
utility offers several advantages. For example, a system administrator can use <b><span>nimadm</span></b> to create a copy of a
NIM client's rootvg and migrate the disk to a newer version or release of AIX.
All of this can be done <b>without
disruption</b> to the client (there is no outage required to perform the
migration). After the migration is finished, the only downtime required will be
a single scheduled reboot of the system.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">AIX
6.1 introduced new capability that most UNIX operating systems are still
working on. </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&amp;context=SG11G&amp;dc=DB520&amp;uid=isg3T1012104&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=utf-8&amp;lang=#concurrent"><span>Concurrent
Updates of the AIX Kernel</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.....<b>without a reboot</b>! IBM is always working hard at making AIX an OS
that can provide <b>continuous availability</b>,
even if it needs to be patched. AIX now has the ability to update certain kernel
components and kernel extensions in place, without needing a system reboot. In
addition, concurrent updates can be removed from the system without needing a
reboot. Can you do this with other UNIX OSs? <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And thats just some of the features that make
AIX <b>the</b> only UNIX OS that I recommend
for Enterprise systems. There are many more tools and features that I couldnt
live without (like alt_disk_install, savevg, installp, WPARs, etc, the list
goes on). If you are new to AIX and you are considering what your next UNIX OS
should be, then I recommend you take a <b>very</b>
close look at </span><span lang="EN-AU"><a href="http://ibm.com/aix"><span>AIX</span></a></span><span lang="EN-AU">.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">And finally, the support provided by IBM, is
first class. Whenever Ive needed assistance with an AIX issue or query, I have
always received timely, professional and useful advice. On the rare occasions
where Ive uncovered a new bug, IBM AIX support have always been quick to
provide me with an interim fix to resolve or workaround a problem. Thats the
sort of support youd expect for an Enterprise UNIX OS, isnt it? Whats the
support like from your current UNIX (or Linux) OS vendor?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Linux is still a viable UNIX operating system.
However, I think its more suited to certain workloads like small to medium
size mail, web and other utility servers and services. AIX, however, would be
my platform of choice for my 10TB Oracle database running SAP ERP, not just for
performance reasons, but primarily because of the system administration
features of AIX that allow me to support and manage the system without
impacting my customers or enforcing reboots/outages whenever I need to change
something on the system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">All IBM need to do is create their own Linux
distribution (Blue Linux perhaps?)
that has all the features of AIX built in and then Im sold! But why would
they? We already have AIX.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p>In <a href="https://pkolaczk.github.io/disk-parallelism/">the previous post</a>, I showed how processing 
file data in parallel can either boost or hurt performance 
depending on the workload and device capabilities. Therefore, in complex programs that mix tasks
of different types using different physical resources, e.g. CPU, storage (e.g. HDD/SSD) 
or network I/O, a need may arise to configure parallelism levels differently for each task type. 
This is typically solved by scheduling tasks of different types on dedicated thread pools.
In this post I’m showing how to implement a solution in Rust with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a>. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>After I realized multi-threaded access to data on a single HDD is a <em>really bad idea</em>, 
I wanted to process files residing on HDD with only one thread-per-device, but still keep multithreading for SSDs.
Also, both groups of files should be processed independently, in parallel.
Honestly, that didn’t look like something hard to do. I’ve been using thread pools in Java for years.
For each file to process, I just need to schedule an asynchronous hashing task on a proper thread pool 
executor and that’s it. How hard could that be in Rust?</p>

<p>My program already used Rayon in a very functional style, so the main part of the code responsible for file hashing 
looked like that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>   <span>// collection of input files</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>files</span>
  <span>.into_par_iter</span><span>()</span>           <span>// creates a Rayon parallel iterator over all files</span>
  <span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>f</span><span>|</span> <span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span>  <span>// reads the contents of a file and returns its hash; blocking</span>
  <span>.collect</span><span>();</span>                
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this approach, all the files are processed by the default Rayon thread pool and
there is no place to tell Rayon which thread pool to use for given file.</p>



<p>Rayon allows to build custom thread pools with <code>ThreadPoolBuilder</code> and <code>ThreadPool</code> structs. 
It is quite easy to create a custom thread pool and manually spawn tasks on it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>thread</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
<span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Task executes on thread: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>()</span><span>.id</span><span>()));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to process our collection on this custom thread pool, we need to change the “main loop” of 
a program slightly and replace the parallel iterator with a traditional loop and a channel to receive the 
results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.build</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> <span>// need to close all senders, otherwise...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span>  <span>// ... this would block</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Now it is quite straightforward to transform this approach to more than one thread pool:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ssd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 

<span>let</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>PathBuf</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>  
    <span>let</span> <span>pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>is_on_ssd</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>&amp;</span><span>ssd_pool</span> 
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>&amp;</span><span>hdd_pool</span> 
    <span>};</span>
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>);</span> 
<span>let</span> <span>hashes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FileHash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>rx</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.collect</span><span>();</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation of <code>is_on_ssd</code> is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>


<p>Unfortunately <code>ThreadPool.spawn()</code> method requires that the lambda passed to it has a 
<code>'static</code> lifetime, which means it must not borrow any data other than global. 
The examples above work only because we pass all the input data by <code>move</code>, so the lambda
does not close over anything outside and the <code>'static</code> constraint is satisfied.</p>

<p>Of course the real world is much more complex, and, in my program actually the spawned task<br>
needed to borrow the local context, which holds some common stuff like configuration or logger.</p>

<p>Referencing any outside variable from inside of <code>spawn</code> lambda does not compile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>logger</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>
    <span>pool</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>logger</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"Computing hash of: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>.display</span><span>()));</span>
        <span>tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>compute_hash</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<pre>error[E0597]: `logger` does not live long enough

</pre>

<p>The compiler can’t see that all the tasks we spawned must finish before we leave the scope
where <code>logger</code> is valid. This is where Rayon scopes are coming to rescue us.</p>

<p>Instead of spawning tasks directly on the thread pool struct, we first need to create a scope 
object by calling <code>scope</code> function. The scope is guaranteed to exit only after all tasks launched 
inside it finished. This essentially allows the tasks inside the scope to access variables that live 
at least as long as the scope:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>

        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about multiple thread pools? 
A single <code>Scope</code> in Rayon is always associated with a single <code>ThreadPool</code>. 
Therefore, if we need multiple thread pools, then we need multiple scopes, active at the same time.
Fortunately, scopes can be nested:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>logger</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Log</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span>
<span>hdd_pool</span><span>.scope</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>hdd_scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ssd_pool</span><span>.scope</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>|</span><span>ssd_scope</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>let</span> <span>tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>tx</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>

<h2 id="dynamic-number-of-thread-pools">Dynamic Number of Thread Pools</h2>
<p>With only two pools, nesting doesn’t look bad, but in my program I needed more than two pools – 
one per each physical device. And even worse, I didn’t know the number of them statically at compile time.</p>

<p>At this point I wanted to abstract out the process of creating nested scopes in a way it doesn’t pollute the 
logic of the program. I came up with the following function idea:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>multi_scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>OP</span><span>:</span> <span>for</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'s</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>FnOnce</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'s</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span> <span>+</span> <span>'scope</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span><span>,</span>
    <span>R</span><span>:</span> <span>Send</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes an array of <code>ThreadPool</code> references, constructs a <code>Scope</code> for each <code>ThreadPool</code> 
and executes a user-defined operation (typically passed as a lambda) inside all of these scopes.
The operation receives a list of references to <code>Scope</code> so it can spawn tasks on desired <code>Scope</code> associated
with the given <code>ThreadPool</code>. The usage is quite straightforward and very similar to the built-in <code>scope</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>hdd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ssd_pool</span> <span>=</span> <span>rayon</span><span>::</span><span>ThreadPoolBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span><span>.num_threads</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span> 
<span>let</span> <span>pools</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>hdd_pool</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ssd_pool</span><span>];</span> <span>// this could be constructed dynamically in real-world code</span>

<span>let</span> <span>common</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span> <span>// common data</span>
<span>multi_scope</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>pools</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span><span>scopes</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>scopes</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* execute on hdd_pool, can use &amp;common */</span> <span>});</span>
    <span>scopes</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(|</span><span>s</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* execute on ssd_pool, can use &amp;common */</span> <span>});</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How to implement <code>multi_scope</code>? There is no way to obtain a <code>Scope</code> value directly from Rayon.
The only way we can get a reference to a <code>Scope</code> is inside the lambda passed to <code>scope</code>.
So if we need multiple scopes active at the same time, we must nest scopes in each other. 
This sounds like a recursion.</p>

<h2 id="my-code-is-correct-but-the-borrow-checker-disagrees">My Code Is Correct, But The Borrow Checker Disagrees</h2>
<p>My initial take looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>multi_scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An additional function <code>nest</code> creates one new <code>Scope</code> and pushes it into the <code>scopes</code> vector, then it calls itself
recursively until it runs out of <code>ThreadPool</code> values. Finally it calls the user operation <code>op</code> 
passing the created <code>scopes</code> vector to it.</p>

<p>To my surprise that didn’t compile. Oh well!</p>
<pre>error[E0621]: explicit lifetime required in the type of `scopes`
  --&gt; src/pools.rs:42:25
   |
34 | fn nest&lt;'scope, OP, R&gt;(pools: &amp;[&amp;ThreadPool], scopes: Vec&lt;&amp;Scope&lt;'scope&gt;&gt;, op: OP) -&gt; R

   |                         ^ lifetime `'scope` required

</pre>

<p>Wait, there is a hint here. As usual with Rust coding, let’s apply the hint the compiler gave to us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>nest</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>,</span> <span>OP</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>pools</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ThreadPool</span><span>],</span> <span>scopes</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>'scope</span> <span>Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'scope</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>OP</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this made it only worse:</p>
<pre>error[E0495]: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime due to conflicting requirements

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's install OpenBSD on a Lenovo Thinkpad X270. I used this computer for my
computer science studies. It has both Arch Linux and Windows 10 installed as
dual boot. Now that I'm no longer required to run Windows, I can ditch the dual
boot and install an operating system of my choice.</p>

<p>First, I grab my work Thinkpad running Arch Linux and some USB dongle big enough
for the <a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/miniroot67.fs">amd64 miniroot
image</a> (roughly
five megabytes, that is). This small image does not include the file sets, which
will be downloaded during installation instead. I also download the <a href="https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/SHA256">SHA256
checksums</a> from the
Swiss mirror, and verify the downloaded image, before I copy it on my dongle:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256 
miniroot67.fs: OK
$ sudo dd if=miniroot67.fs of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>The Thinkpad X270 is connected to my network through Ethernet. The WiFi firmware
usually needs to be installed separately, so only Ethernet will work out of the
box. The BIOS has UEFI activated. OpenBSD and UEFI has issues on older hardware
(at least on a 2014 Dell laptop I have), but let's try it on this laptop,
anyway.</p>
<p>I plug in the dongle prepared before, and start the computer. I interrupt
the regular boot with Enter and pick an alternative boot method by pressing F12.
Now I pick my USB dongle. After roughly a minute, the installer has been
started. Now I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I choose the option <code>I</code> to install OpenBSD.</li>
<li>For the keyboard layout, I pick <code>sg</code>, for Swiss German.</li>
<li>As a hostname, I simply pick <code>x270</code>, because it's a Thinkpad X270, and I'm not
  very creative when it comes to naming things.</li>
<li>From the available network options (<code>iwm0</code>: WiFi, <code>em0</code>: Ethernet, and
  <code>vlan0</code>: Virtual LAN), I pick <code>em0</code>.</li>
<li>I try to get an IPv4 address over DHCP, which seems to work very quickly.</li>
<li>Next, I type in my very secret root password twice.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> start <code>sshd</code> by default, because I don't need to connect to this
  machine through SSH. It's supposed to be a workstation, not a server.</li>
<li>The X Window System should not be started by <code>xnodm(1)</code>, so I leave it to
  <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Neither do I want to change the default to <code>com0</code>.</li>
<li>I set up my user <code>patrick</code> with my proper name <code>Patrick Bucher</code>, and a decent
  password.</li>
<li>The time zone has been detected properly as <code>Europe/Zurich</code>, which I just
  leave the way it is.</li>
<li>The installer detected two disks: <code>sd0</code> and <code>sd1</code>. Since <code>sd0</code> is the detected
  SSD in my laptop, the UEFI issue from my Dell laptop doesn't exist on this
  computer. I pick <code>sd0</code> for the root disk, since <code>sd1</code> is my USB dongle.</li>
<li>I choose to use the whole disk with a GPT partitioning schema, because it's
  2020.</li>
<li>An auto-allocated layout for <code>sd0</code> is presented. It looks decent to me, so I
  just go with that auto layout.</li>
<li>I don't want to initialize another disk, so I just press Enter (<code>done</code>).</li>
<li>Since the miniroot image does not come with the file sets, I pick <code>http</code> as
  the location for the sets.</li>
<li>I don't use a proxy, and use the mirror <code>mirrog.ungleich.ch</code> and the server
  directory <code>pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code> as proposed.</li>
<li>Next, I unselect the game sets by entering <code>-game*</code>. (I heard that they're not
  much fun to play.) I leave all the other sets activated, including the <code>x</code>
  sets, which will be required for the GUI later on.</li>
<li>After those sets are installed, I press Enter (<code>done</code>). Now the installer
  performs various tasks, after which I choose to <code>halt</code> the computer. This
  gives me time to remove the USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now restart my laptop, and OpenBSD boots. This takes more time than booting
Arch Linux, which uses <code>systemd</code>, whereas OpenBSD uses <code>rc</code>, which performs the
startup tasks sequentially.</p>
<p>There's a message showing up that various firmware (<code>intel-firmware</code>,
<code>iwm-firmware</code>, <code>inteldrm-firmware</code>, <code>uvideo-firmware</code>, and <code>vmm-firmware</code>) has
been installed automatically. Very nice, indeed.</p>
<h2>WiFi Connection</h2>
<p>Now that the <code>iwm-firmware</code> has been installed, I can connect right away to my
WiFi network <code>frzbxpdb5</code>. I create a file called <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>, wich
<code>hostname</code> being a literal string, and <code>iwm0</code> being the WiFi network card. The
connection to my WiFi network consists of a single line:</p>
<pre><code>dhcp nwid frzbxpdb5 wpakey [my-wpakey]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>frzbxpdb5</code> is my WiFi network's ESSID, and <code>[my-wpakey]</code> needs to be
replaced by the actual WPA key.</p>
<p>Then the networking can be restarted for that device:</p>
<pre><code># sh /etc/netstart iwm0
</code></pre>
<p>This script is kind enough to set the file permissions of <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>
to <code>640</code>, and then connects to my WiFi network.</p>
<p>I unplug the Ethernet cable and <code>ping openbsd.org</code>, which works fine, even after
a restart.</p>

<p>My GUI on Unix-like systems is based on the Dynamic Window Manager (<code>dwm</code>) and a
couple of other tools, such as <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, <code>slstatus</code>, <code>slock</code>, all created and
maintained by the <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a> community.</p>
<p>This software doesn't come with configuration facilities, but needs to be
configured in the respective C header file <code>config.h</code>, and then re-compiled.
Even though OpenBSD offers <code>dwm</code> as a package, customizing and configuring that
window manager requires to build it from source.</p>
<h2>Building <code>dwm</code> and Friends</h2>
<p>First, I need to install <code>git</code> to fetch the source code:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add git
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fetch the source code for <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, and <code>slstatus</code> from <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/slstatus
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dwm</code></h3>
<p>Next, I try to build <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd dwm
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This fails with an error message (<code>'ft2build.h' file not found</code>), which reminds
me of building <code>dwm</code> on FreeBSD roughly a month before. Since I can finde the
header file at another location:</p>
<pre><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>
<p>I simply can modify the <code>config.mk</code> accordingly by changing</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = $(X11INC}/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, I only need to comment the above line, and uncomment the line below</p>
<pre><code># OpenBSD (uncomment)
</code></pre>
<p>The Suckless folks obviously are friendly towards OpenBSD, which is also
noticable in other places (more evidence to be shown further below).</p>
<p>The next compilation attempt succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>So let's install <code>dwm</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>By default, and as to be seen in <code>config.h</code>, the keyboard combination
<code>[Alt]+[Shift]+[Enter]</code> (deeply engraved into the muscle memories of many <code>dwm</code>
users) starts the <code>st</code> terminal. This will be built in a while. However, I
prefer to use the <em>Super</em> or <em>Windows</em> key instead of <code>Alt</code>, since the former
is of no use in OpenBSD, and the latter still comes in handy when working with
the emacs readline mode. Therefore, I change the <code>MODKEY</code> from</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod1Mask
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>
<p>Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>st</code></h3>
<p>Let's switch over to the <code>st</code> source directory and just try to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../st
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get a warning that the function <code>pledge</code> (an OpenBSD mitigation, which
is built into the <code>master</code> branch, but surrounded by an <code>ifdef</code> preprocessor
statement, so that it will only be compiled for OpenBSD) is imported implicitly.
Let's just ignore this warning for now.</p>
<p>What's worse, the compilation fails with the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ld: error: unable to find library -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the FAQ comes in handy, stating that</p>
<pre><code>If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove -lrt from
config.mk, ...
</code></pre>
<p>Having done so in <code>config.mk</code>, <code>st</code> compiles without any further issues, and,
thus, can be rebuilt and installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dmenu</code></h3>
<p>Even OpenBSD users with Suckless tools have to open another GUI application than
a terminal emulator once in a while. For this purpose, Suckless offers <code>dmenu</code>.
Let's switch over to it and compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../dmenu
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have the issue with <code>ft2build.h</code>, which can be resolved as above with
<code>dwm</code>: by using the proper path for <code>FREETYPEINC</code> in <code>config.mk</code>. Afterwards,
the build succeeds, and <code>dmenu</code> can be installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>slstatus</code></h3>
<p><code>dwm</code> has a status bar on the top right, which can be used to show various
information. I used to write some shell commands in <code>.xinitrc</code> to compose such a
status line, and then set it by <code>xset -b</code> once every five seconds or so. This
approach generates a multitude of processes every couple of seconds.</p>
<p><code>slstatus</code> is a C programm that is capable of showing various kinds of more or
less useful information. Let's switch over to <code>slstatus</code> and see, what is
available in <code>config.def.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../slstatus
$ less config.def.h
</code></pre>
<p>The comments section lists different functions (<code>battery_perc</code> for the battery
percentage, <code>datetime</code> for date and time information, <code>temp</code> for thermal
information, etc.). I usually display the CPU load, the battery percentage, the
memory usage, the current keyboard layout, and the current date and time.</p>
<p>Before configuring those, let's try to compile <code>slstatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, so let's configure the information to be displayed in
<code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    "%s",     "%F %T" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the current date as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%F %T"
2020-09-05 19:26:38
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to have the weekday included, but not the seconds, so I define a
different argument string:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
Sat 2020-09-05 19:27
</code></pre>
<p>That's better, so let's use it in <code>config.h</code> (surrounded with some spaces in the
format string):</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    " %s ",   "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The other settings I like to have do not require any arguments, at least not on
OpenBSD, so I only need to define a decent format string (with <code>|</code> as a
seperator) for those:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format           argument */
    { cpu_perc,     " cpu: %s%% |", NULL },
    { battery_perc, " bat: %s%% |", NULL },
    { ram_used,     " mem: %s |",   NULL },
    { keymap,       " %s |"         NULL },
    { datetime,     " %s ",         "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This actually compiles, so let's install it:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring X Startup</h2>
<p>Now that all software is compiled and installed, let's run X. To do so, a file
<code>.xinitrc</code> in the user's directory is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag “huskyai” to see all the posts, or visit the <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-walkthrough/">overview section</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-building-the-machine-learning-model/">previous post</a> we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model to build “Husky AI”.</p>
<p>This post is all about threat modeling the system to identify scenarios for attacks which we will perform in the upcoming posts.</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of moving pieces already in the “Husky AI” system that we built out.</p>
<p>To get started with identifiying security issues in a systematic way, I typically create a high-level Threat Model diagram using Microsoft Threat Modeling tool (or just on a piece of paper at times too).</p>
<p>The following is a picture the “Husky AI” threat model:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-threat-model.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-threat-model.png" alt="Husky AI Threat Model"></a></p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack, but if you read the previous posts around building and operationalizing a machine learning model the assets and their connections should make sense.</p>
<p>The threat modeling tool automatically proposes threats and it is quite thorough. It is actually common that engineers complain that the tool creates too much noise, and it takes too long to review. For instance, this threat model led to 96 threats initially that were automatically identified by the tool.</p>
<p>By clicking on a component in the threat modeling tool, we can view the specific threats for that particular asset. For example, this is the view for the web server:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/threatmodelingtool.jpg"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/threatmodelingtool.jpg" alt="Threat Modeling Tool Example"></a></p>
<p>Even though there is a large amount of threats, it is great because it highlights issues you might not think about, or not think about each time you perform threat modeling. However, it can be a bit of an overload, and threats are repetitive. There is really no requirement to use the tool - it’s just there to help.</p>
<p>When it comes to brainstorming and classifying threats, I use STRIDE. STRIDE is a threat classification technique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">developed by Microsoft</a>. It puts threats into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>S</strong>poofing</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>ampering</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>epudiation</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>enial of service</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>levation of privilege</li>
</ol>
<p>It is good approach to hold threat modeling sessions with engineers, those can be informal whiteboard sessions. Try to have at at least one threat in each category for every asset.</p>
<p><strong>It is not uncommon to forget about repudiation issues</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Repudiation</strong> is the issue of someone denying that they performed a certain action. How can you proof or disproof someone indeed updated a machine learning model in production for instance?</p>
<h3 id="perturbation-attacks">Perturbation Attacks</h3>
<p>When it comes to machine learning specific attacks most of them can be easily mapped to STRIDE categories. The one I had issues with are attacks that “query the model”, so called <strong>perturbation attacks</strong>. For the purpose of the threat model, I decided that this is a “spoofing” issue. An adversary tries to trick the algorithm to misclassify an image.</p>
<p>Now, let’s review the core assets of the Husky AI system, and brainstorm about attacks and mitigations.</p>

<p>The following section lists the core assets and threats that were identified during threat modeling. This information is ideally persistent in a bug tracking system, something like Jira.</p>
<p>Threats and mitigations are a moving target, something that was considered mitigated yesterday might not be mitigated anymore today. This is also were red teaming comes into the picture to help with the realization that every system has vulnerabilities that can be exploited - there is no such thing is a 100% mitigation.</p>
<p>Let’s look through the main assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training, Validation Images</li>
<li>Public facing REST API</li>
<li>Stored Machine Learning Model</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Bing API Key</li>
<li>SSH Access and Keys</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the flow of the post, let’s filter them to the most interesting ones from machine learning point of view.</p>
<p>The full list of threats can be seen in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>. For anything I want to test, I added a <strong>“red team opportunity”</strong> note.</p>
<h2 id="identified-machine-learning-threats">Identified machine learning threats</h2>
<p>The following is the list of threats that I want to build attacks for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker brute forces images to find incorrect predictions/labels (dumb and smart ML fuzzing) - Perturbation</li>
<li>Attacker gains read access to the model</li>
<li>Attacker modifies persisted model file (backdoor and re-train)</li>
<li>Attacker denies modifying the model file</li>
<li>Attacker poisons the supply chain of third-party libraries</li>
<li>Attacker tampers with images on disk to impact training performance</li>
<li>Attacker modifies Jupyter Notebook file to insert a backdoor (key logger or data stealer)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a fairly good list with some interesting attack scenarios that we can research and perform.</p>
<p>There are other ML specific attacks such as model inversion, membership inference which I might explore at a later point, possibly when upgrading Husky AI to provide a more complex categorical model. For more information on machine learning threats see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning">Failure modes in machine learning</a> by Microsoft, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07658.pdf">Hacking Neural Networks - A short introduction</a> by Michael Kissner.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>In the next post, we will do hands-on attacks against the exposed prediction API via different brute force approaches.</p>
<p>Now it will become interesting! <strong>Stay tuned.</strong></p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>This appendix contains the most significant threats identified and more insights. When doing this you want to store this information in a issues/bug tracking system such as Jira. This helps to track and also review dispositions in the future.</p>

September 6, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>As developers, we frequently use keyboard shortcuts. Some enthusiasts know hundreds, others are contempt with the essential ones. But every developer does know some. It is unthinkable to browse the Web, searching for a solution to your CSS alignment problem without using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>. Debugging would be tedious if we couldn’t pause and resume a program’s execution with the keyboard.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, I have been able to significantly expand my keyboard shortcut knowledge with my new side-project web app <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a>.<br>
In particular, I knew only a few shortcuts for the web-based tools I am using in my daily work. This post describes how it took me less than 1 hour to learn <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 new key combinations</a>. Fortunately, KeyCombiner keeps a detailed history of a user’s learning progress, so that I could write this post retrospectively.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the 42 minutes of learning time was interrupted by breaks, and the process involved some other tasks, such as creating the collection of shortcuts I wanted to learn. However, I did, in fact, spend only 42 minutes practicing the shortcuts and have had similar results with other shortcut collections.</p>

<p>The first step to learning new keyboard shortcuts is to define which. I don’t think it is efficient to try and learn all shortcuts for a particular application. You will end up with many that you do not use in your daily work and that you will soon forget again.</p>
<p>Creating custom collections of keyboard shortcuts is perhaps the greatest strength of KeyCombiner and sets it apart from any other tool. Within minutes or less, you can have a personal collection by importing shortcuts from popular apps. I like to compare its approach to how you build playlists in music software. Instead of browsing your favorite artists’ albums, you browse categories of your favorite applications. Instead of adding songs to your playlists, you can add keyboard shortcuts to your collections.</p>
<p>For this challenge, I created a new collection named “<a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 to learn</a>”.
Then, I browsed KeyCombiner’s <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/">public collections</a> and started to import everything I wanted to learn. As my goal was to get better with web application shortcuts, I focused on the public collections for Gmail, GitHub, GDrive, Docs, Slack, and Twitter. Importing the combinations into my new shortcut collection looked like this:</p>

<p>Collecting shortcuts from KeyCombiner’s <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/56">public Gmail collection</a>.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, I added a few shortcuts for <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/">Smartgit</a> manually. It is a graphical Git client that I am using extensively. For some reason, I never learned its shortcuts. Unfortunately, KeyCombiner does not yet have a public shortcut collection for Smartgit that I could rely on. However, manual input does the job:</p>

</figure>
<p>You can browse the resulting collection with 50 keyboard shortcuts here: <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 to learn</a>.</p>
<p>I am afraid you will have to trust me that I did not know these shortcuts already before this experiment. However, as reassurance, you can check <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/a-collection-of-all-keyboard-shortcuts-i-use/">my previous blog post</a> covering all the shortcuts I was using until a few weeks ago. The list there does not include these new ones.</p>
<p>To validate the success of this experiment, I will simply use KeyCombiner’s confidence metric. It will analyze my performance and tell me which shortcuts are already etched into my muscle memory during practice. So, the challenge will be completed successfully once this card says <strong>50/50</strong>:</p>

</figure>

<p>Learning new shortcuts with KeyCombiner is dead simple. You click on the practice button for a particular collection, and the software does the rest. It will create 60-seconds training exercises where you are supposed to type the shortcuts of a collection as fast and as correct as possible.</p>
<p>With every input, KeyCombiner remembers if it was correct and how long you took. It will use this information along with some machine learning to calculate a so-called confidence value for each key combination in your collections. A high confidence value means that you mastered a combination. Key combinations with a low value will occur more often in practice sessions, so you are not stuck repeating what you know already.
There are a few additional aspects to it, but the good thing is that users do not have to bother with the learning algorithm’s internal workings. Repeatedly doing practice runs is enough.</p>
<h2 id="starting-to-remember-the-keys">Starting to remember the keys</h2>
<p>The very beginning of learning a new collection is the hardest part. While I do not yet know any of the shortcuts, I have to rely on KeyCombiner’s delayed key hints to type any. Sometimes, I just skip combinations immediately to see what the keys are.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/practice-start.gif" alt="The very first practice runs with a new collection are quite slow."> <figcaption>

<p>This is how results for such a practice run look like:</p>

<p>Typical practice statistics for a collection you do not know yet.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Surprisingly, even in the first practice run, I got a couple of combinations right without key hints. This means that they occurred multiple times already or simply that I was able to guess them correctly. The latter is often the case for <em>go to</em> shortcuts, which have been made popular by Gmail and are now used in many web applications.</p>
<p>After a few practice runs, I started to disable key hints and only relied on skipping combinations where I couldn’t remember the keys. KeyCombiner will then display the skipped combination’s keys, so I have a shot at remembering them next time.</p>
<p>The statistics for the 10th practice run looked as follows:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after10.png" alt="After just 10 minutes of practice, I already know some of the shortcuts."> <figcaption>
<p>After just 10 minutes of practice, I already know some of the shortcuts.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>KeyCombiner recognizes 9 shortcuts as mastered. So far, so good.</p>
<h2 id="building-muscle-memory">Building muscle memory</h2>
<p>After another 10 practice runs, statistics showed that I knew already most of the shortcuts:</p>

<p>However, KeyCombiner punishes errors quite heavily and is hesitant to show keys as mastered that I have just recently mistyped.
At this stage, it starts to get interesting to check the collection and see which specific shortcuts have very low confidence values. Usually, it is obvious to see some patterns:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The figure shows that I had problems knowing which modifiers to use for GSuite shortcuts (Gmail, GDrive and Docs). Some use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> , some <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> and some don’t have a modifier at all (e.g. forwarding a mail in Gmail). I found that having a good look at such problems between practice runs can speed my progress, but it is not required.</p>
<p>All that is needed is to keep hitting the practice button. At this stage, muscle memory starts to build, and the average time I need for each combination goes down quickly. KeyCombiner considers the average time metric for its confidence values.</p>
<h2 id="completing-the-challenge">Completing the challenge</h2>
<p>After 35 practice runs, things started to look very good:</p>
<figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A confidence value of 3 means that I mastered a particular combination.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the combination with the lowest confidence value. Surprisingly, it is the relatively simple <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>:
</p><figure>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A combination is not guaranteed to appear in every practice. Furthermore, it can appear multiple times, especially when it has a low confidence value compared to the other shortcuts of a collection. Consequently, the above figure shows only 11 practice runs but 15 correct occurences and 3 errors.</p>
<p>I made quite a few mistakes with this combination in the beginning. Therefore KeyCombiner’s algorithm is skill skeptical about my skills. Errors usually mean that I thought I knew the shortcut but then typed a wrong combination. In this case, I suspect it is because I was hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> instead or missing the <kbd>a</kbd> key. <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> is a bit tricky to type if you are used to hit both <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> with your little finger. However, my performance has been much better recently. Just a couple more practice runs to go and KeyCombiner will forgive my earlier mistakes.</p>
<p>Then, finally, after another 7 practice runs, I had reached my goal:</p>

<p>Practicing on this collection looks much different now than in the beginning:</p>

</figure>

<p>It is straightforward to do a similar challenge. Simply go to <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">https://keycombiner.com</a>, create an account, import some shortcuts from public collections, and start practicing. However, I would like to share some additional
tips that make learning new shortcuts more pleasant for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a bit more fun in the beginning if you throw in some shortcuts that you already know. Even better, just extend one of your existing collections with new shortcuts that you want to learn. KeyCombiner will automatically show the new ones more frequently during practice.</li>
<li>I sometimes activate key hints <em>without</em> delay, which brings some variety to the learning experience and can help build muscle memory. If you are a good typist, you will be able to type a lot of shortcuts within the 60 seconds time limit.</li>
<li>KeyCombiner will try to filter out shortcuts than cannot be captured during training. Those are marked with a yellow background in your collections. However, sometimes an invalid combination may still make it into your practice session, for example, if a browser extension does not pass it on to KeyCombiner. Simply append an underscore to any of the keys, e.g. <kbd>shift_</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, so that KeyCombiner will recognize it as invalid.</li>
<li>Depending on how frequently use a shortcut in your daily work, your memory may fade over time. To counter this, I suggest practicing also mastered collections from time-to-time. A couple of one-minute practice sessions can be a nice break from work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have already learned many new keyboard shortcuts with KeyCombiner before this challenge. However, I never kept track of how long it took exactly until I knew them. I am thrilled with finding out that I could learn …</p></div></div>

In Python its easy, just import boto3 module and starting coding. Things are bit different when you write Lambda handlers in Java. Lets explore and see how you can write a simple HelloWorld Lambda handler in java. I have planned couple of how-to projects that I am going to write in Java. Hence I thought to do HelloWorld post before we dive into complex handlers. Feel free to follow me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PanchalRajan"> twitter</a>  for upcoming updates.</p>
<p>To implement handler, we are going to use Maven, Eclipse and AWS SDK for Java. Below are the version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java:  1.8</li>
<li>Eclipse:  Version: 2020-06 (4.16.0)</li>
<li>AWS SDK: 2.14.11</li>
<li>Maven: 3.6.3 (Included with eclipse)</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started, create a new empty maven project in eclipse. Go to File-&gt; New-&gt; Maven Project. In new project dialog box. select "create simple project" and hit next. On next screen. add appropriate information about the project and hit finish. For example:</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/aws-sdk-java/new-maven-project.PNG" alt="aws sdk java new maven project"> </p>
<p>Now your project is created. Open pom.xml and add following code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;net.rajanpanchal&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;lambda-java-demo&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Lambda-Java-Demo&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;HelloWorld Lambda handler in java&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
        &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;
        &lt;aws.java.sdk.version&gt;2.14.11&lt;/aws.java.sdk.version&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
        &lt;dependencies&gt;
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;software.amazon.awssdk&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;bom&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;${aws.java.sdk.version}&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
                &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
            &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;/dependencies&gt;
    &lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.amazonaws&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;aws-lambda-java-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;

        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.code.gson&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;gson&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.8.6&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;configuration&gt;
                    &lt;source&gt;${maven.compiler.source}&lt;/source&gt;
                    &lt;target&gt;${maven.compiler.target}&lt;/target&gt;
                &lt;/configuration&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-shade-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;3.2.4&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;executions&gt;
                    &lt;execution&gt;
                        &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;
                        &lt;goals&gt;
                            &lt;goal&gt;shade&lt;/goal&gt;
                        &lt;/goals&gt;
                    &lt;/execution&gt;
                &lt;/executions&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We are setting some properties in <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> tag like AWS SDK version and Java Version. We are adding AWS SDK dependency and Lambda core dependency with desired version. Google JSON dependency is added to convert between JSON and Java object and vice versa.
In plugins, we define maven compiler plugin to compile the code and another important plugin called <code>maven-shade-plugin</code>. This plugin helps to create <strong>fat jar</strong> a.k.a <strong>Uber jar</strong>. This jar will contain all the dependencies that are required to successfully run the lambda function.</p>
<p>Now lets create the handler. </p>
<pre><code><span>package</span> net.rajanpanchal.handlers;

<span>import</span> java.util.Map;

<span>import</span> com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;
<span>import</span> com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.LambdaLogger;
<span>import</span> com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;
<span>import</span> com.google.gson.Gson;
<span>import</span> com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;

<span>public</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>HelloWorldHandler</span> <span>implements</span> <span>RequestHandler</span>&lt;<span>Map</span>&lt;<span>String</span>,<span>String</span>&gt;, <span>String</span>&gt;</span>{
      Gson gson = <span>new</span> GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
      <span>@Override</span>
      <span><span>public</span> String <span>handleRequest</span><span>(Map&lt;String,String&gt; event, Context context)</span>
      </span>{
        LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();
        String response = <span>new</span> String(<span>"200 OK"</span>);
        
        logger.log(<span>"ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: "</span> + gson.toJson(System.getenv()));
        logger.log(<span>"CONTEXT: "</span> + gson.toJson(context));
        
        logger.log(<span>"EVENT: "</span> + gson.toJson(event));
        logger.log(<span>"EVENT TYPE: "</span> + event.getClass().toString());
        <span>return</span> response;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Here were are implementing <code>RequestHandler</code> that will accept a <code>Map</code> of <code>String</code> and outputs a <code>String</code> response. The handler is not doing much. Just logging some stuff from <code>context</code> and <code>event</code>  and in response it sends <code>200 OK</code> string.
After this right click on project, go to 'Run as' and click 'Maven build'. A configuration window will open. In 'Goals' type <code>package</code> and hit 'Run' . Build should be successful and will create a fat jar in <code>target</code> folder.</p>
<p>Now go to AWS console and create a new Lambda function with Java 8 as runtime and upload this jar from <strong>Function Code</strong> section. To test this Lambda, create a test event and execute the test.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Daniel J. Bernstein's IM2000 email proposal is not a good idea</h2>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the pandemic hit global news, everyone (I presume) and especially on Twitter were sharing their predictions about the future.<br></p><p>Apart from the range of predictions from dark and gloomy to “it’s going to be alright soon” optimism, there was intense collective thought being shared on how to adjust to the new life.&nbsp;</p><p>A dangerous outside world with a potentially lethal virus, getting stuck indoors and hence being wrenched out of every routine and social habits, general anxiety and fear for yourself and your loved ones - didn’t stop people from sharing “if you don’t build your business ideas while you’re stuck indoors, you’ll never do it”. Or “this is the best time to become fit and the best version of yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>You know, non-empathetic BS that treats human beings like a robot following a set of instructions.</p><p>I spent month 1 in anxiety and fear desperately trying to adjust to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By month 2, I’d figured out that to not go insane, I will have to block news, browsing Twitter, and any websites tracking the pandemic 12 times a day. And so I did. My mind felt wrinkled until I let go, and it felt like I could relax and breathe &nbsp;again.</p><p>In the same month, I thought I would adjust and “become the best version of myself” or whatever hustle porn phrase was trending that week. I failed at adjusting and living a “normal” life for several months. I stopped trying so hard.</p><p>It also dawned on me that while my problems are real, the people really facing a hard time are those from the lower economic strata. They don't just have an option to live indoors and "WFH". They can't quit their jobs and go home. I became grateful about my position and privilege in life and internally I stopped complaining to myself about how difficult life is during a pandemic. I became calm.</p><p>It’s month 7 and I think I finally got a grip on my life.</p><p>You see, building new routines and adjusting to new social normals is a long process. Sure, you can write it down on a piece of paper and try to follow it, but your body and mind aren’t fully aligned and adjusted.</p><p>In particular, I found being stuck within 4 walls and not talking to anyone other than my family members for months wasn't going to help me adjust to the new normal.</p><p>In June, I started writing. This was the first step towards normalcy as I finally got in touch with my thoughts again and found an outlet to express them.</p><p>And only in the last month, I created a routine around going downstairs for a long 45-min brisk walk (while wearing a mask and avoiding people like the plague). I also started scheduling a lot of calls whenever someone from my life reached out, just to catch up with them and behave like we would had we bumped into each other at a coffee shop.</p><p>Human beings are incredible at adapting to a situation and normalising it. Life is finally starting to feel normal again. It just takes time, in this case 7 &nbsp;months.</p><p>I can see this in other people too - their behaviours, their mood, what they are saying when you talk to them and what you see people talk about on Twitter and other social platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, I played <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=puertorico" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">Akash</a> in the afternoon. In the evening. I walked while listening and occasionally babbling with a group of people on <a href="https://leher.app/" target="_blank">Leher</a> (Clubhouse for India). It felt like a fun conversation we would have otherwise had over a beer had we met physically. At night, I joked and laughed around with college friends over a Zoom call. </p><p>Life felt normal.</p><p>While the pandemic is bigger than ever and it’s imperative that we continue following all safety guidelines, having a routine you follow everyday, going outdoors regularly, socialising with people on video or phone calls - helps me adjust to this life in a pandemic.</p></div></div>]]>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

<blockquote>
<p>dcwr (don't care, won't read)
This project aims to make your entire blog contained in a single file (content sourced from where ever you want), of which you can do what ever you want via utilizing tools built in a community fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<pre><code>mkdir myblog &amp;&amp; <span>cd</span> myblog
npm i -g jsonblog-cli
blog init
blog build
blog serve
</code></pre>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I feel like I don't speak just for myself but over the years maintaining a blog has been rather arduous. I hate setting them up, I suck at keeping them alive, I dislike buying into platforms, I cannot seem to back them up and they are always way more than I actually needed.</p>
<p>Just recently I happened to stumble upon a Hacker News comment by Jedberg where he also listed his pain points with personal blogging which largely mirroed my own gripes. His comment and seeing the other trends wishing to relive the personal blogging era compelled me to attempt something.</p>
<p>Some readers might have realized already, but JSON Blog was inspired by another project that I co-founded a few years ago called JSON Resume. Essentially your resume is defined as formatted data which you are free to take anywhere you want and use community built tooling to analyze, render and host.</p>
<p>JSON Blog is at core a schematic simply to describe a blog, and I've spent some time developing some initial tooling to make it rather seamless to get started.
Here is a simple example (that generates this site)</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"site"</span>: {
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"My Blog"</span>,
    <span>"description"</span>: <span>"I write my thoughts here"</span>
  },
  <span>"basics"</span>: {
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Thomas Davis"</span>
  },
  <span>"posts"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"Introducing JSON Blog"</span>,
      <span>"source"</span>: <span>"https://gist.github.com/thomasdavis/db7db8d07ccb086504261802edf3069a/raw/introducing.md"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"pages"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"About"</span>,
      <span>"source"</span>: <span>"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thomasdavis/3e7eed3648f3a3e3d7b9a84d99fa1da762c5b880/about.md"</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>As with any schema, you might say that the naming conventions are terrible, and I'd agree. The reasoning behind any individual semantic choices might be rather complex so I can just tell you by what principles I chose these initial ones.</p>
<p>First, once you add anything to a schema, it cannot be removed without difficulty from the ecosystem. So I've only started with the bare essentials. There are some obvious additions to be made such as tags and categories but I've yet to define them for the second reason.</p>
<p>Schema's are only valubable in so far as person's will agree with them. (all reality is just consensus anyway jks). The success of a schema is dependent on if it is agreeable or not, therefore you need to have a bunch of differing opinions. So there is a schema repo, where anyone can chime in and some people will be elevated to arbiters. And those who debate will complain about lack of change, can't blame them, but change should be slow. And I won't pretend, that Me, the programmatic surgeon dictator won't have a final say. All I can say on that is that I've been consistenly wrong and;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak - Epictetus</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The tools I've built are Javascript only but as a schematic the language of tooling is agnostic.</p>
<p><code>source</code> in the schema is meant to promote that a blog shouldn't care where you host your content, just make it a publically accessible URI, of which plenty of servies support Drive, Dropbox, Gist, pastbin</p>
<p>Essentially implying you can pass your <code>blog.json</code> to any function/company and they should be able to construct it. Which leads onto the concept of a <code>generator</code>;</p>
<h3>Generators</h3>
<p>A <code>generator</code> so far envisioned is a function that simply takes a <code>blog.json</code> and outputs an array of files and their content e.g.</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"files"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"index.html"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"&lt;h1&gt;I am a good person&lt;/h1&gt;"</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"assets/logo.svg"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"&lt;svg version=\"1.1\"&gt;&lt;text&gt;Hello noob&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;"</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>generator</code> should then loop through the files, create directories and files where necessary and pipe in the <code>content</code>.</p>
<p>You can read more about generators at <a href="https://github.com/jsonblog/jsonblog-generator-boilerplate">https://github.com/jsonblog/jsonblog-generator-boilerplate</a></p>
<p>This entire project is still under development, but looking for feedback because I can't tell if it is a good idea.</p>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p><span>2020-04-02</span>

  

  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2020-04-02-library.jpg" alt="The Library of My Repos" title="The Library of My Repos"></p><p>I maintain several <a href="https://adamj.eu/projects/">open source Python projects</a>, each in its own GitHub repository.
I like to keep them all up to date according to a kind of template - similarity increases maintainability.</p>

<p>I have thought about putting them in a monorepo, but this would be unidiomatic and make it harder for contributors to join in.
A tool I discovered recently to make working with multiple repositories more like using a monorepo is <a href="https://myrepos.branchable.com/">myrepos</a>.</p>

<p>It allows you to run commands in multiple repositories, group the output by repository, and see a summary of successes/failures.
It’s a relatively simple tool - not much more than a complex invocation of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a> - but its integration with VCS’s does sometimes come in useful.
It let me replace a flaky shell loop I was copy-pasting between uses.</p>

<p>It installs as the <code>mr</code> command, which has a bunch of subcommands.
The most useful one is <code>run</code>, to run arbitrary commands in each repository.</p>

<p>For example, to see git status in all repositories, you can run:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git status
<span>mr run: /Users/chainz/Documents/Projects/apig-wsgi
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.


nothing to commit, working tree clean


mr run: /Users/chainz/Documents/Projects/django-cors-headers
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.


nothing to commit, working tree clean


</span><span>...
</span><span>
mr run: finished (19 ok)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(Output cropped because I have 19 repositories!)</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>You can install myrepos from most package managers (<a href="https://myrepos.branchable.com/install/">docs</a>).
On macOS I installed it with <code>brew install myrepos</code>.</p>

<p>You then need to register your repositories by <code>cd</code>ing to their folder and running <code>mr register</code>.
This adds them to the default configuration file <code>~/.mrconfig</code>.</p>

<p>I added one change to my configuration file, to make 8 jobs to run in parallel by default:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[DEFAULT]</span>
<span>jobs</span> <span>=</span> <span>8</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Most of the changes I make are parallel-safe and this gives quite a speed boost.
You can switch back to serial for a single command with <code>--jobs 1</code> before the subcommand.</p>

<p>There is some documentation on the <a href="https://myrepos.branchable.com/">home page</a> and more on the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/myrepos/mr.1.en.html">man page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="example-change-check-manifest">Example Change: check-manifest</h2>

<p>myrepos has saved me a heaps of time and reduced errors for many different changes on my projects.
For example, recently I wanted to update the <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files in all my repositories.
This controls which files are added to the built Python packages.
I also wanted to run the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/"><code>check-manifest</code> tool</a> in my projects’ testing environments, to ensure their <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files were correct.</p>

<p>I started by <code>cd</code>’ing to one of my smaller projects, and figuring out the steps that would do this.</p>

<p>First, I looked through the files and manually made the necessary edits.
I then converted them to equivalent shell commands, like <code>rm</code> and <code>sed</code>.
I then copied those into a shell script I called <code>add-check-manifest.sh</code>, placed in my <code>~/scripts</code> folder, which is on my <code>$PATH</code> so myrepos can use it.</p>

<p>I iterated on the script by resetting the repository and rerunning the script, until it worked all the way through.
The final version was this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span>set</span> <span>-e</span>


<span>rm </span>MANIFEST.in
<span>echo</span> <span>'global-exclude *.py[cod]
graft tests
prune __pycache__
prune requirements
include HISTORY.rst
include LICENSE
include README.rst
exclude .editorconfig
exclude pyproject.toml
exclude pytest.ini
exclude tox.ini'</span> <span>&gt;</span> MANIFEST.in
<span>cd </span>requirements
<span>echo</span> <span>"check-manifest ; python_version == '3.8.*'"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> requirements.in
<span>sort </span>requirements.in <span>-o</span> requirements.in
./compile.sh
<span>cd</span> ..
<span>sed</span> <span>-E</span> <span>-i</span> <span>''</span> <span>-e</span> <span>'s/    multilint/    multilint\
    check-manifest/g'</span> tox.ini
tox <span>-r</span> <span>-e</span> py38-codestyle
git switch <span>-c</span> check-manifest
git add <span>--all</span>
git commit <span>-m</span> <span>"Test MANIFEST.in with check-manifest"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I used <code>set -e</code> so the shell script would <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/821396/aborting-a-shell-script-if-any-command-returns-a-non-zero-value">fail after the first error</a>.</li>
  <li>The first two commands replace the <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file to a new basic template - enough for many of my projects.</li>
  <li>The <code>cd</code> into requirements is for updating the test requirements. I use <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools">pip-tools’ <code>pip-compile</code></a> to manage these.</li>
  <li>The <code>sed</code> command injects the call to <code>check-manifest</code> in the test runs.</li>
  <li>The <code>tox</code> command runs the tests.
<code>check-manifest</code> would fail the run on projects that the <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file needed editing on.</li>
  <li>The final <code>git</code> commands create a new branch and commit the changes.
I left pushing to GitHub pull request for later.</li>
</ul>

<p>I knew it wouldn’t work perfectly on all the repositories, but it was much faster than making all these changes manually.</p>

<p>I then ran it across all repositories with <code>mr run add-check-manifest.sh</code>.
<code>tox</code> failed on a few, as I expected, so I went and patched them individually.</p>

<p>After each repository was ready, I ran another script I have <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/chainz-scripts/blob/master/pushupr">called <code>pushupr</code></a>.
This pushes a branch and creates a GitHub pull request for it using <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">GitHub’s <code>hub</code></a>.
I then needed CI to pass on all the PR’s, to be sure, so I took a break to go get on with life.</p>

<p>When I came back to my computer later, all the PR’s had passed.
I tabbed through all the pull requests and hit the merge buttons.</p>

<p>I could then run a few myrepos commands to pull those locally and clean up the branches:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git checkout master
<span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git pull <span>--prune</span>
<span>$</span><span> </span>mr run git branch <span>-D</span> check-manifest</code></pre></figure>

<p>Writing the script took a little initial investment, but saved me an hour or two of work.
In fact, without it, I would probably have never have bothered to do such a mundane task across all my projects.
A great example of automation as an enabler!</p>

    <p>Computer Programming can be hard , can be complex to understand for some people, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be fun. From the beginning , programming languages were in English , well most of them except some special languages. But I have designed a programming language which let’s people program in Cats’ language, Mew Mew Mew. Which despite being a esoteric language is very much usable , and let’s programmers create complex program. I
also have conducted a small study to find real world use cases of MewMew programming language.</p>



<p>Programming in Cats’ language , it is lunacy or what? But it’s reality. With MewMew one can program in cats’ language, but it is not actually the cats’ language but the human interpretation of cats’ language , mew mew mew.
MewMew is an esoteric programming language built with ANTLR4 and C++. It is not intended to be used for commercial or mainstream programming instead , it was designed to be learning project for me or any other novice language designer who want get started building their own programming language.
While majority of programming languages are in English or I should say human languages but this language intends to be one of the first language to be in ‘non-human’ (not technically) language.</p>



<p>MewMew is implemented using ANTLR4 and C++. Though using Dynamically typed host language would be given me more flexibilty designing the language, I chose to use a statically typed for a multiple reasons , First it is fast. Second , the language becomes much more runtime safe. When experimenting with early prototypes , I tried Python and PLY (Python Lex and Yacc) , Tatsu and even Flex &amp; Bison. Python and PLY was not chosen because it was too much slow , even Cythonzing didn’t give advantage. Tatsu was kind of better than PLY but again speed issue, and Flex &amp; Bison , I didn’t chose them because of their over complexity , a language small as MewMew required a huge codebase. Finally I setteled for ANTLR4 , It was comparativaly fast thanks to its ALL(*) algorithm , on top of that the API of it was very easy to catch on but also very robust.
When Designing MewMew , I left some places which can be used to improve or extend the language in future.</p>

<p>MewMew doesn’t use any traditional numbers (0 to 9) instead it uses ‘mew’s. For example , ‘mew’ will get converted to 1 , ‘mewmew’ will get converted to 2  , ‘mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew’ will get converted to 10 and so on so forth but zero has special case , to get only zero one can use ‘mew-mew’.
MewMew also has few operator similar to C++, which are discussed in GitHub project repository README. MewMew is all about numbers, it doesn’t contain any other types such as strings , chars , arrays etc , which keeps the language lightweight. Every number in mewmew is a floating point number.
MewMew also has if , if else and a repeat loop aka. Meow loop expression. It also has a special type of function called scratch function which open the door of extending the language in future. Syntax of if statement is something like Expression ? Statements ; where ‘Expression’ takes any type of expression , on Truthy value the ‘Statements’ will get executed. Similar to that Expression ? Statements1 : Statements2 ; is the syntax of if-else statement, if the value of ‘Expression’ is truthy the ‘Statements1’ will get executed else ‘Statement2’ will get executed. The syntax of meow loop is something like this @ Expression : Statements; the ‘Statements’ will get executed N times where N = Expression. Scratch function syntax is something like #(Expression) where ‘#’ can be repeated from 1 to many times. But as of 5 functions are defined only.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison of some simple program written in MewMew and C++ :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>In MewMew</th>
      <th>In C++</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@#####(mew):<br>m % mewmew == mew – mew ?<br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%2 == 0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@####(mew):<br>m % mewmewmew == mew – mew &amp; m % ###(mew) == mew – mew ? <br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; m%5==0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>MewMew is an esoteric language which is morelike a joke than a commercial language. It was created to be a leaning project for which it has done successfully. In future it also might work as an reference to learning language designing for future.With the scratch function it opens new doors forexpanding the language in future. It will only took a few lines of code in switch…case statement to add a new function.</p>

    <h3>PDP 11/70 Emulator - v3.1 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
      This emulator came about because years ago I was a programmer for RSTS/E on a PDP 11/45 and had admired the console idle loop light pattern - but I couldn't quite remember how it looked. Given the unavailability of real systems it became time to write
      an emulator!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to start with a PDP 11/45 emulator but the extra memory of a PDP 11/70 became far too attractive (a whole 4MB!). It took some time before I finally produced a
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11-45.html">PDP 11/45</a> version.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met my core objective - I can now see the RSTS/E console light pattern that I was looking for, and found that newer versions (eg v9.6) have a different light pattern. Also I have now seen some of the light patterns for other OSes. RSX and BSD 2.11
      have their own different patterns and Unix V5 and Ultrix operate with absolute minimum light movement (I'm assuming they operates mostly in WAIT mode).
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting all of the operating systems used here presents its own set of challenges - one of which is finding the software in the first place. But one of the most interesting was RSTS/E V06C which has its own
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/RSTSv06c.html">story</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The boot code in this emulator is a custom PDP 11 program running with it's own set of light patterns. It is initially loaded at address 140000 and has a LIGHTS command which operates by mapping and executing a WAIT instruction from a pattern of virtual addresses located in Supervisor
      mode. You can also use the BOOT command to start one of the guest operating systems listed below, or the ODT command to start a version of the Octal Debugging Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However boot code like this was not part of early PDP 11s. These systems had no BIOS or other software to help get the bare metal started. If you were lucky perhaps the previous boot code would still be intact in non-volatile magnetic core memory, but in general booting the system required toggling in a small bootstrap loader from the front panel. There are listings of bootstrap loaders for various devices
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/pdp-11/bootstraps.html">here</a>.
      If you are a purist don't use the boot code! Instead find the bootstrap code for the device you want to boot from and toggle it in through the switches. However be warned - the boot program will not work unless toggled in perfectly which often takes a few goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the switch commands for booting from an RK05 where the value at address 1002 selects the unit number (rk0, rk1, rk2, etc). Goodluck!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you wish to toggle in a simple light chaser to the front panel then here are some switch commands which can be used:
    </p>
    <pre><b>

                            HALT, 001000, LOAD ADDRESS

                            001000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
To restart the initial boot code (if it has not been overwritten) use the switch commands:
    <pre>HALT, 140000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
    <p>
      If you plan to run the emulator repeatedly or for a project, consider downloading the emulator to your own machine or server.
      This will <b>significantly</b> speed any of the emulator disk accesses and response times. All files and emulator OS
      disks can be found in the top level folder of
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/</a></b> or in the zip file
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.zip">pdp11.zip</a></b> Please note that browser security
      policy may prevent local emulator pages from booting disk images so please read the information in <b>StartChrome.cmd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the emulator works then you can browse the source files on
      <b><a href="https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js">Github</a></b>.
      The main Javascript files are pdp11.js, fpp.js and iopage.js
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many PDP emulators out there and I have never seen what I consider to be a complete list. Some of the really interesting ones can be found by googling terms such as "vhdl pdp 11". However the gold standard is SIMH at
      <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">Trailing Edge</a>.
      A different approach to Javascript PDP 11 emulation can be found at
      <a href="http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pdp11/">www.pcjs.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the first PDP 11 emulator would be SIM-11 written in FORTRAN before the first PDP 11/20 hardware was even built - see
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html"> How the PDP-11 Was Born</a>. There is more PDP 11 history at
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/main.html">www.hampage.hu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if you want your own PDP 11/70 front panel you might consider a

      Happy emulating!

    <p>C++ modules are slated to be the biggest change in C++ since its inception.
The design of modules has several essential goals in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Top-down isolation</strong> - The â€œimporterâ€� of a module cannot affect the content
of the module being imported. The state of the compiler (preprocessor) in the
importing source has no bearing on the processing of the imported code.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom-up isolation</strong> - The content of a module does not affect the state
of the preprocessor in the importing code.</li>
  <li><strong>Lateral isolation</strong> - If two modules are imported by the same file, there
is no â€œcross-talkâ€� between them. The ordering of the import statements is
insignificant.</li>
  <li><strong>Physical encapsulation</strong> - Only entities which are explicitly declared as
exported by a module will be visible to consumers. Non-exported entities
within a module will not affect name lookup in other modules (barring some
possible strangeness with ADL. Long storyâ€¦)</li>
  <li><strong>Modular interfaces</strong> - The current module design enforces that for any
given module, the entire public interface of that module is declared in a
single TU called the â€œmodule-interface unitâ€� (MIU). The implementation of
subsets of the module interface may be defined in different TUs called
â€œpartitions.â€�</li>
</ol>

<p>If youâ€™ve been hoping for modules for as long as many have, youâ€™ll note that
â€œcompilation speedâ€� is missing from this list. Nevertheless, this is one of the
biggest promises of modules. The possible speedup from modules is merely a
consequence of the above design aspects.</p>

<p>This author can identify several aspects of C++ compilation that can greatly
benefit from the design of modules. In order of most-to-least-obvious:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tokenization caching</strong> - Because of TU isolation, tokenizing a TU can be
cached when the module is later imported into another TU.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse-tree caching</strong> - Same as above. Tokenization and parsing are some of
the most expensive operations in compiling C++. In my own tests, parsing can
consume up to 30% of compilation time for files with a large preprocessed
output.</li>
  <li><strong>Lazy re-generation</strong> - If <code>foo</code> imports <code>bar</code>, and we later make changes to
the <em>implementation</em> of <code>bar</code>, we may be able to omit recompilation of <code>foo</code>.
Only changes to <em>the interface</em> of <code>bar</code> necessitate recompilation of <code>foo</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Template specialization memoization</strong> - This one is a bit more subtle and
may take more work to implement, but the potential speedups are <em>enormous</em>.
In short: A specialization of a class or function template appearing in the
module interface unit can be cached and loaded from disk later.</li>
  <li><strong>Inline function codegen caching</strong> - Codegen results for inline functions
(including function templates and member functions of class templates) can
be cached and later re-loaded by the compiler backend.</li>
  <li><strong>Inline function codegen elision</strong> -  <code>extern template</code> allows the compiler
to omit performing codegen for function and class templates. This is hugely
beneficial for the <em>linker</em> when it performs de-dup. Modules may allow the
compiler to perform more <code>extern template</code>-style optimizations implicitly.</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, itâ€™s looking pretty good, yeah?</p>

<p>But thereâ€™s something missing. A horrible, terrible, no-good, very bad flaw.</p>



<p>Fortran implemented a module system that bears a slight resemblance to the
design proposed for C++. A few short months ago, a paper
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1300r0.pdf">p1300</a>
was written by the SG15 group for review in San Diego. As far as I can tell,
the paper was not discussed nor reviewed by any relevant eyes.</p>

<p>The gist of it is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have module <code>foo</code> and module <code>bar</code>, defined by <code>foo.cpp</code> and <code>bar.cpp</code>
respectively.</li>
  <li><code>bar.cpp</code> has an <code>import foo;</code> statement.</li>
  <li>How do we make sure that <code>import foo</code> will resolve when compiling <code>bar.cpp</code>?
The current design and implementations require there to exist what is known
as the â€œbinary module interfaceâ€� (abbreviated as BMI) defined for <code>foo</code>. The
BMI is a file on the filesystem that describes the exported interface of the
module <code>foo</code>. Iâ€™ll call that BMI <code>foo.bmi</code> for now. The extension isnâ€™t
important.</li>
  <li>Creation of <code>foo.bmi</code> is a byproduct of the compilation of <code>foo.cpp</code>. When
compiling <code>foo.cpp</code>, the compiler will emit a <code>foo.o</code> and <code>foo.bmi</code>.
As a consequence of this design, <code>foo.cpp</code> <strong>must</strong> be compiled <em>before</em>
<code>bar.cpp</code>!</li>
</ol>

<p>If alarm bells arenâ€™t ringing already, let me discuss the way we currently work
using header files:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have a â€œmoduleâ€� <code>foo</code> defined by <code>foo.cpp</code> and <code>foo.hpp</code>, and a â€œmoduleâ€�
<code>bar</code> defined by <code>bar.cpp</code> and <code>bar.hpp</code>. Easy to understand.</li>
  <li><code>bar.cpp</code> contains an <code>#include &lt;foo.hpp&gt;</code> preprocessor statement.</li>
  <li>How do we make sure that <code>#include &lt;foo.hpp&gt;</code> resolves when compiling
<code>bar.cpp</code>? Itâ€™s simple: Make sure <code>foo.hpp</code> is present in a directory on the
header search path list. We do not need to do any additional pre-processing.</li>
  <li>There is no ordering requirement between the compilation of the â€œmodulesâ€�
<code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>. They can be processed in parallel.</li>
</ol>

<p>Parallelization is probably the single most important aspect of increasing
build performance. At this point, it isnâ€™t even something you think about when
you are optimizing your build because <em>it is already there</em>.</p>

<p>Modules change that. The importing of a module creates a â€œhappens-beforeâ€�
dependency where <code>#include</code> did not. (I discuss this ordering in my <a href="https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2018/12/20/build-like-ninja-1.html">Building
Like (a) Ninja post</a>).</p>

<p>The consequences of this design were explored very recently by Rene Rivera in
<a href="https://bfgroup.github.io/cpp_tooling_stats/modules/modules_perf_D1441R1.html"><em>Are modules fast?</em></a>.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: No. Or, more accurately: Itâ€™s subtle, but mostly <em>no</em>. The
current module implementation used in that paper is extremely primitive but is
still a valuable benchmark to understand what modules may look like
performance-wise. Expectedly, as hardware parallelism increases, headersâ€™ lead
over modules becomes more and more pronounced. There is also a relationship
between the DAG-depth (i.e. The length of the chain of modules that <code>import</code>
each other). As this depth increases, modules grow slower and slower, while
headers remain fairly constant for even â€œextremeâ€� depths approaching 300).</p>



<p>Suppose I have this source file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>greetings</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>iostream</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>greeting</span><span>::</span><span>english</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pretty simple. Since we import some modules, we will need to compile
<code>greetings</code> and <code>std.iostream</code> <em>before</em> we can compile this file.</p>

<p>So, letâ€™s do thatâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>Uhâ€¦</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve been given a source file with two imports. Thatâ€™s it. We donâ€™t have
anything else. Where is <code>greetings</code> defined? We need to find a file that
contains a <code>module greetings;</code> statement.</p>

<p>This file located on the other side of the galaxy, <code>talk.cpp</code>, looks promising:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span><span>;</span>

<span>#ifdef FROMBULATE
#include &lt;hello.h&gt;
#endif
</span>
<span>#ifndef ABSYNTH
</span><span>export</span> <span>module</span> <span>something</span><span>.</span><span>pie</span><span>;</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
<span>import</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>greeting</span> <span>{</span>

<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>english</span><span>();</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It defines that <code>greeting::english</code> function that we want. But how do we know
that this is the right file? It doesnâ€™t contain a <code>module greetings;</code> line!</p>

<p>But it does. Sometimes. It turns out when we compile with <code>-DFROMBULATE</code>, then
the file <code>hello.h</code> is pasted into the source file. Whatâ€™s in there?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#ifdef __SOME_BUILTIN_MACRO__
# define MODULE_NAME greetings
#else // Legacy module name
# define MODULE_NAME salutations
#endif
</span>
<span>export</span> <span>module</span> <span>MODULE_NAME</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Oh no.</p>

<p>This is fine. This is fineâ€¦ Donâ€™t worry. All we need to do isâ€¦ <em>run the
preprocessor</em> to check if the file comes out as <code>module salutations</code> or <code>module
greetings</code>.</p>

<p>This is okay, butâ€¦ There are 4,201 files that could define modules that can
be imported, and any one of them could be <code>module greetings;</code></p>

<p>Also, we canâ€™t use our own implementation of the preprocessor: We need to run
<em>exactly</em> the preprocessor that will be compiling this code. See that
<code>__SOME_BUILTIN_MACRO__</code>? We have no clue what that is. If we donâ€™t get it
<em>exactly</em> right, the compilation will fail, or, even worse, we may <em>miscompile</em>
the file.</p>

<p>So what can we do? We could cache the names of all the modules after
preprocessing all the files, right? Well, where do we store that mapping? And
what happens when we want to compile with a different compiler that results in
a different mapping? What if we add new files that need to be scanned? Do we
need to search every directory that contains these thousands of source files
every time we build, just to check if any modules were added, removed, or
renamed? On systems where process startup and/or filesystem access is not cheap,
these costs will add up.</p>



<p>These two problems are distinct but related in that I (and many others) believe
that one change to the modules design will fix them both: <strong>Module interface
unit locations must be deterministic</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two alternative ideas to enforce this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Force MIU filenames to derive from the moduleâ€™s name. This mimics the design
of header filenames being directly related to how they are found from an
<code>#include</code> directive.</li>
  <li>Provide a â€œmanifestâ€� or â€œmappingâ€� file that describes the filepath to an
MIU based on the module name. This file will need to be user-provided, or we
are back in the scanning problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>With MIU lookup deterministic and easily defined, we can then go to the next
essential step: The BMI of a module must be lazily generated.</p>

<p>The compilation ordering between TUs will kill module adoption dead in its
tracks. Even relatively shallow DAG depths are much slower than the equivalent
with header files. The only answer is that TU compilation <em>must</em> be
parallelizable, even in the face of importing other TUs.</p>

<p>In this respect, C++ would be best to mimic Pythonâ€™s <code>import</code> implementation:
When a new <code>import</code> statement is encountered, Python will first find a source
file corresponding to that module, and then look for a pre-compiled version in
a deterministic fashion. If the pre-compiled version already exists and is
up-to-date, it will be used. If no pre-compiled version exists, the source file
will be compiled and the resulting bytecode will be written to disk. The
bytecode is then loaded. If two interpreter instances encounter the same
un-compiled source file at the same time, they will race to write the …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
