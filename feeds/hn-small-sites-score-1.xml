Invented by Gallant, Lambert, and Vanstone, this technique is commonly referred to as GLV Endomorphism and can now be activated in Bitcoin Core in order to improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin’s signature verification.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Hal Finney, GLV Endomorphism, and Patents</h2><p dir="ltr">The use of GLV Endomorphism was first explored by Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest contributors and the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0" target="_blank">first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In his <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3238.msg45565#msg45565" target="_blank">bitcointalk.org post</a> on February 8th, 2011, Finney shared that he had been inspired to experiment with this technique after reading the <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.394.3037&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, by Hankerson, Menezes and Vanstone</a> - the same Vanstone who submitted the patent. His initial tests were promising, revealing an estimated 25% increase in the optimization of signature verification.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the feature has been implemented in Bitcoin Core but has yet to be enabled due to the existing patent around the cryptography that was filed on December 23rd, 1999.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“Implementing it was one of the original motivations in developing the libsecp256k1 library, which has since replaced all cryptographic use of OpenSSL in Bitcoin Core,” shared Andrew Poelstra of <a href="https://blockstream.com/" target="_blank">Blockstream</a> with the BTC Times. “(But) it was disabled by default to avoid patent concerns and has never been enabled in Bitcoin Core.”</p><p dir="ltr">With the patent expiring, Bitcoin developers will now move quickly to enable GLV Endomorphism: the feature had actually been rigorously tested throughout the development of the libsecp256k1 library, making the optimization just as well-tested and mature as any other part of the library.</p><p dir="ltr">Once activated, nodes should expect to see a significant drop in ongoing resource usage as Bitcoin Core will now utilize the new signature verification method for freshly received transactions and blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">“Once you've caught up to the tip, nodes need to verify every new transaction and block that comes in. All of that will see a direct reduction in CPU usage,” <a href="https://twitter.com/pwuille" target="_blank">Pieter Wuille</a> of <a href="https://chaincode.com/" target="_blank">Chaincode Labs</a> told the BTC Times.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us" target="_blank">Dr. Adam Back</a> of Blockstream commented, “this performance improvement was first drawn attention to for use in Bitcoin by Hal Finney.

<p>God...dammit</p>


<p>It's hard to see a child outside today without some kind of iDevice pumping high fidelity 192kbps stereo lossless audio into their shiny white headphones, but <em>BACK IN MY</em> <em>DAY, </em>the iPod hadn't been invented yet. &nbsp;Pickings were slim. &nbsp;Walkmen were outdated, CD players were pricey and would skip if bumped around despite their ESP features, MiniDisk was another stillborn Sony format, and MP3 players were still ugly and ridiculously expensive (at least Apple fixed the ugly part).</p>
<p>Thus, Tiger Electronics, pioneers in the high tech market of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, invented "Hit Clips"</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="438" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9pgMmDmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hit Clips were small cheap digital audio players that could play music off of little plastic cartridges. &nbsp;The audio was mono, sounded terrible, and only included a 60 second sample of a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5621" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Better hold on to that patent Tiger...</p>
<p>Still, the songs were officially licensed and included bands like The Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Sugar Ray, and ...Dreamstreet</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Dream_street_blue_house" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="456" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg 635w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-300x215.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-417x300.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"></a></p>
<p>The 00s were a very strange time for all of us...</p>
<p>Anywho, while helping my 17 year old cousin move some furniture, we came across a large collection of hit clip cartridges, but no player. &nbsp;Struck with a wave of nostalgia, I asked if I could take one to do a tear down.</p>
<p>Thus this post.</p>

<p>The hit clip cartridge has 8 metal contacts on the back:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5620" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Taking it apart, I was hoping to find some identifiable piece of hardware, but instead found the chip-on-board construction that is so popular with super-low-cost low-power electronics along with a few discrete components.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5625" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Under this blob of epoxy is a wire-bonded chip of silicon. &nbsp;The song is likely hard coded directly into the silicon wafer rather than being programmed there after the fact using flash or OTP memory. &nbsp;It's cheaper that way if you make enough units.</p>
<p>This didn't give me a whole lot to work from, but assuming the capacitor is a bypass capacitor (decent assumption), I at least had some idea of how to power the thing. &nbsp;Poking around for a bit gave me this schematic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="hitclipschem" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what the two No Connect pins do, but apparently there was a version of the Hit Clip that allowed music to be recorded to special cartridges, so I'm guessing they have something to do with that.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much voltage the part needed, but a quick search on Ebay gave me some idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png"><img loading="lazy" title="ebay" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png" alt="" width="720" height="475" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png 720w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-300x197.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-454x300.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>3 AAAs means 4.5V. &nbsp;Also, can you believe people are bidding $40+ for these things?</p>
<p>Before I could get serious about debugging, I needed some way to connect traces to the board easily. &nbsp;I ended up soldering on some header pins and plugging it into a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5629" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>My original assumption was that the bottom-left pin was ground as it connected to the mystery chip more times than the other power-pin. &nbsp;You'll note the scratch-outs indicate that I was wrong. &nbsp;In that configuration, the chip drew 200+mA during the half-second that I left it connected. &nbsp;Presumably there's a reverse bias protection diode that I was blowing up.</p>
<p>Swapping the power pins around, the current started at around 280<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A before dropping to zero.</p>
<p>Convinced that I had it right, I moved to the other pins. &nbsp;There were four pins to chose from and a voltage measurement showed me that two of them were at the 4.5V rail while the other two were settled close to 0V.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since I had already identified my two power pins, I had to assume that these four pins were used for data somehow and that the two high pins had internal pull up resistors.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin1 to ground sinks about 12mA from that pin. &nbsp;12mA is much to high to be from a simple pull-up resistor. &nbsp;My guess is that it's some kind of output pin to tell the player that the cartridge is inserted all the way. I decided to leave it alone and move on to Pin 3.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin 3 to ground caused the circuit's current draw to rise from zero up to 300<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A. Removing this short did nothing to change the current increase although it did settle down after about 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This is when I knew I was on to something. &nbsp;60 seconds of current draw meant that this part was outputting its music sample! &nbsp;I was expecting the player to need to do something more complicated like pull bytes of music off the cartridge over a SPI bus or at least provide a clock source, but it turns out that the cartridge can handle that all by itself. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the two on-board series resistors are used for fine-tuning its internal clock source after the chip has been printed.</p>
<p>I quickly whipped out my oscilloscope and took a trace of Pin 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="scopetrace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png" alt="" width="1191" height="816" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png 1191w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-300x205.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-1024x701.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-437x300.png 437w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"></a></p>
<p>Data!</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><em>While doing a similar job on a different Hit Clip (Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men), I discovered different behavior. &nbsp;Connecting Pin 3 to ground did nothing while commenting pin 1 to&nbsp;ground toggled between data and no data. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there was a change in the Hit Clip design through generations, or if I took imprecise notes. &nbsp;The PCB layouts of the two clips is clearly different, and it looks like pin 3 is NC on the second clip.</em></p>
<p>I noticed an intermittent square wave with a period of almost exactly 24kHz and a duty cycle that varied with time. &nbsp;Pin 4 had similar data.</p>
<p>So there was definitely something going on here, and it was definitely digital somehow, but I needed some way to capture loads of digital data to later analyze. &nbsp;Fortunately, Santa gave me an 8 bit Saleae logic analyzer for Christmas:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I actually picked up the Hit Clip while looking for a good project to test this thing out. &nbsp;It's a really nice device, and the Windows/Mac/Linux compatible software is really slick.</p>
<p>Anywho, with the Saleae connected to Pin 2 and Pin 4, I reactivated the circuit and took a trace at a 24MHz sample rate. &nbsp;I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae trace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png" alt="" width="1647" height="986" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png 1647w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-300x179.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-1024x613.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px"></a></p>
<p>It was strange at first to see how the two data lines appeared to take turns, but once I remembered that Hit Clips only output in mono, it made a lot more sense. &nbsp;These two lines are encoding the same mono stream of audio.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the low-going blips, I noticed that they were quantized. &nbsp;The length of each blip was always near some integer multiple of 0.3333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about audio amplifiers, I theorized that these two outputs are meant to directly drive the push and pull FETs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a> in real time. &nbsp;In other words, a blip on one line pulls the waveform output voltage up while a blip on the other pulls it down. &nbsp;The width of the blip indicates how hard (or for how long) it pulls.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Redditor urquan points out that this kind of modulation is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation">Sigma-Delta Modulation</a>.</p>
<p>While it's technically a digital output, it's encoded in such a way that it can be fed directly into an analog circuit.</p>
<p>I figured that if I could give myself a stream of this data, I could probably simulate the output digitally. &nbsp;To cut down on the number of samples, I exported the trace to a CSV file that only records timestamps when something changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae output" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png" alt="" width="534" height="810" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png 534w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In order to make use of this data, I just needed to record how much time passed between a signal dropping low and rising up again, and I should have such data points arriving at almost exactly 24kHz. &nbsp;All of the data from one pin was given a positive value while the data from the other pin was given a negative value.</p>
<p>I also tried quantizing the data by dividing the time delays by 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s, and while this worked for small numbers, I noticed that some of the larger numbers fell pretty far from a solid integer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>It looked like 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s was a bad estimate of the actual quantization time. &nbsp;Thinking a little more critically, I noticed that a 24kHz wave has a period of 41.67<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s. &nbsp;When divided by my quantization time, this comes out to almost exactly 125 which is pretty darn close to 128, a power of two.</p>
<p>Changing my quantization time to 0.3255<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s or <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d7efcee3110178fb773e908bd2b03eda.gif" alt=""></span> yielded much better results:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3255" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>Now the question is what to do with these numbers.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved just pumping them into a WAV file and taking a listen. &nbsp;With this setup, all of the negative numbers were negative points on the waveform. &nbsp;Here's the first 400 samples:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png"><img loading="lazy" title="straightwav" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png" alt="" width="937" height="523" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png 937w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-300x167.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-500x279.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px"></a></p>
<p>I took these values, gained them up to fill a 16 bit WAV file and took a listen:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element</audio></p>
<p>Firstly, I was shocked to get anything even closely resembling audio. &nbsp;Especially something so recognizable. &nbsp;That being said, the audio quality isn't the best. &nbsp;The raw values out of the cartridge only extend from around -60 to +60 which leads me to believe that it's encoded as a 7-bit signed integer (-64 to +63). &nbsp;7-bit audio isn't exactly lossless, but I wasn't convinced that this was the best I could do.</p>
<p>I found two problems with the way I was decoding the audio:</p>
<h3>Empty samples</h3>
<p>I noticed looking at the Saleae trace that there were many periods in the 24kHz digital data stream where neither trace showed a blip.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png"><img loading="lazy" title="noblip" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png" alt="" width="1055" height="905" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png 1055w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-300x257.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-1024x878.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-349x300.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></a></p>
<p>Because my script was only looking at the blips, I simply skipped passed these data points. &nbsp;The end result was that the music played slightly faster than it should have. &nbsp;This was obvious when my output WAV file was shorter than my original trace.</p>
<p>I modified the script to detect when more than <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_e8eaa034768987e29c645972e4862a53.gif" alt=""></span> passed between consecutive blips and interpolate blips at the proper places by just repeating the previous value.</p>
<h3>Push Pull simulation</h3>
<p>I noticed later on that I wasn't really simulating the push-pull driver that the Hit Clip likely used. &nbsp;The digital encoding is actually more of a derivative of the output waveform rather than the waveform itself. &nbsp;In other words, a positive value doesn't guarantee that the output will be positive, but rather that it will have a positive slope. &nbsp;A larger value specifies a larger slope.</p>
<p>I modified my script to keep a running value starting from zero where the incoming value from the cartridge is added to the previous value to generate the next one. &nbsp;There was a problem of DC drift because the values don't all add up to zero. &nbsp;My first time through, I found that the largest value was 1 while the smallest value was somewhere around -50,000 which overflowed my signed 16 bit WAV output.</p>
<p>I solved this by …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="background">background</h2>
<p>i bought a macbook pro (16", 2019) in May as my XPS died (motherboard fried maybe?). personally i dont like apple at all, but fuck it, i had never used a mac before, so why not? i really love to try new things</p>
<p>for my experience i am satisfied with my macbook, except for some stupid issues, one of which is what im going to dig into in this article</p>
<p><strong>shutdown/restart hang (caused by a kernel panic)</strong></p>
<p>i found many users have encounterd the (almost) same panic: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/">https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/</a></p>
<p>Also on reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/hwk0o5/how_to_stop_watchdog_timeout_kernel_panics/">it's the exactly same panic</a></p>
<p>if you look at the posts you will find they are actually having different problems except all the problems lead to (the same) watchdog timeout</p>
<p>my panic report looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f881a1aae): watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 302 seconds (11 totalcheckins since monitoring last enabled), shutdown in progress

</pre></div>
<p>everytime the hang happens, it eventually gives me a backtrace like this</p>
<p>i called customer service, the friendly tech support suggested that i should reinstall the system (if i cant figure out how to reproduce the panic),
so i erased the partition table and restarted from scratch, then the hang happened again after a few shutdowns</p>
<p>i was really upset, but as i cant reproduce the panic, i cant even ask apple to fix it</p>
<p>then i decided to look into the panic myself</p>
<h2 id="the-backtrace">the backtrace</h2>
<p>the first glance at panic report tells me it might be something wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller">SMC</a>, i followed apple's guide to reset SMC, without luck</p>
<p>apple diagnostics reports no issue</p>
<p>so it must be in the kernel right?</p>
<p>lets start reading the backtrace</p>
<p>by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Call Stack</a> you will have a basic understanding of how kernel subroutines get executed</p>
<p>so how is it executed? just read from brace bottom to top</p>
<p>first thing first, the panic report only gives me related kernel extensions, to find out exactly what code is causing the panic, we have to get symbols from the kernel (extensions)</p>
<p>we dont need to download anything to debug such a problem, the kernel is installed on our machine, just copy it, along with all the related extensions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel <span># kernel</span>
/System/Library/Kernels/Extensions <span># extensions</span>
</pre></div>
<p>follow <a href="https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/">https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/</a> to locate symbols</p>
<p>the kernel slide bytes, and AppleSMC text base address can be found in the panic report, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Kernel slide:     0x0000000007400000

com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[4589419D-7CCC-39A9-9E2F-F73FE42DD902]@0xffffff7f881a9000-&gt;0xffffff7f881c7fff
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="lldb" src="https://jm33.me/img/mac_panic/lldb.webp"></p>
<p>from this screenshot we can see more clearly about what's going on, the backtrace tree is now symbolicated</p>
<h2 id="lets-reverse-some-code">lets reverse some code</h2>
<p>as far as i know AppleSMC kext is proprietary, the only way to know what it does is to reverse it</p>
<p>from lldb, we dont see anything worthy of reversing, its just a watchdog timeout call</p>
<p>anyways, AppleSMC module seems interesting, lets reverse it</p>
<p>after loading the AppleSMC binary, we have to rebase the binary so it matches the address at runtime: Edit, segment, rebase program</p>
<p>press G then paste the address <code>0xffffff7f881b6d9c</code>, we get:</p>

<p>I don't think the <code>while (1)</code> loop is ever going to end. When <code>thread_policy_set</code> fails, it enters the loop and never breaks out.</p>
<p><code>v13</code> represents 1 sec I think. Basically this loop puts a mutex io lock, then feeds watchdog (when the timer pointer plus 248 is null or whatever), finally it sleeps for 1 sec, repeats the loop.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!*</span><span>((</span><span>_BYTE</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>this</span> <span>+</span> <span>248</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>
<p>When it stops feeding the watchdog, watchdog timeouts after about 3 min, hence the panic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-watchdog">whats watchdog</h2>
<p>from <code>man watchdogd</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>watchdogd ensures that the system is healthy and able to make forward progress throughout the system lifecycle.
    If watchdogd or the Watchdog KEXT determine that the system is unhealthy they will attempt to take corrective action and ultimately may panic the system to get it back to a usable state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon[4] can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient memory and file handles, reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run.[5]</p>
<p>Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely unmounted and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from my understanding, <code>SMCWatchDogTimer</code> stopped kicking watchdog somehow (at <code>IOLockUnlock()</code>), then watchdog realizes <code>AppleSMC</code> might be dead, it initiates a panic, reboot and throw the panic report to user</p>

<p>Landfill is an interesting product. The price fluctuates far enough that it can fluctuate from positive to negative and back again. If someone is building a tunnel, you can probably get paid to <i>take</i> landfill. If someone is building an island, you can probably get paid for <i>supplying</i> landfill. There are projects that can only go ahead at certain times: the Hornsby quarry remediation project was only viable because the north connex was being built.</p><p>That's slightly obscure, and there's not much you can do with landfill other than, well, fill land. But we are about to hit a very unusual combination of circumstances which will create some head-scratching economics.</p><p>Solar panels are getting cheaper. The learning rate for solar energy is (probably) the steepest of any energy technology yet deployed. So we can be pretty much assured that within the next decade we'll have enough solar power to power anything we want (as long as it is day time). We'll overprovision our houses and factories (and offices if they still exist) with generation capacity so that in the morning or evening when the sun is hitting at an oblique angle, we still have enough for our needs.</p><p>That means that at peak times, we'll have <i>more</i> than enough solar energy. What do we do with that surplus energy?</p><p>Actually, it's slightly worse than that, because there are some (non-renewable) power plants that can't fully idle. A nuclear reactor can't fully turn off for a few minutes in the middle of the day. Neither can a coal power plant. So they will be running at a time when nobody has a need for power. That may be OK -- if you make a lot of money generating power overnight, you might be prepared to pay some small penalties during the day for overproduction if that's what it takes to keep the system running.</p><p>Which means that someone, somewhere is going to get paid to create a dummy electrical load. We've never (as far as I can tell) seen "grid stability" <i>payments</i> <i>for</i> <i>using</i>&nbsp;electricity before. But it's the inevitable conclusion of where we are the moment: discounted rates for consumers who can change their requirements to help with grid stability exist already; there's no reason that this wouldn't still be necessary when the price of electricity hits zero.</p><p>Therfore, there will be times of the day (in certain weather conditions) when some companies will get <i>paid</i> to use electricity.</p><p>The kinds of consumers that will get paid are likely to be doing something that is energy inefficient (obviously), and not particularly capital intensive (since their equipment will be idle a lot of the time), and making something that can be stored indefinitely (because you definitely can't do just-in-time manufacturing if you are waiting for times when the price for electricity goes negative). But quite a lot of products could be made to fit that.</p><p>A possible product that I think is likely to play out this way is water desalination. Desalinated water is very expensive because of the embedded energy cost: it's often described as "bottled electricity". Currently we tend to use reverse osmosis because it's more energy efficient; but if you don't have to worry about energy costs, you might choose instead to boil water and distil it: since the capital costs are cheaper.</p><p>Now things get even weirder. Let's say you are getting paid 0.5c per kWH (a not unreasonable price) that you use. You might find that you can sell the water for -0.01c per kL. Yes, you can make a profit: not just giving it away, but you could still be profitable while paying someone to consume it.</p><p>If this all plays out, we might have water and electricity (at times) having a negative price. These are common inputs to other processes, so it doesn't end there: there might be a business that requires water and electricity occasionally, but the input costs normally make the business unviable. They in turn might be able to make some money selling the end product at a negative price if their inputs have a negative price.</p><p>If this sounds all a bit unbelievable, remember that up until very recently, many economists thought that it was impossible to have negative interest rates... right up until the moment when they started happening. We already have examples of products that oscillate between positive and negative prices, it's just that they were never fundamental inputs to other processes. My prediction is that by 2030 we will have a small part of the economy ticking away profitably making negative price products.</p><p>(Post scriptum: now for the completely weird: how do negative price products interact with negative interest rates?)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><h2>PilBox - Building Android Apps in PicoLisp</h2>
<p><b>Build your Apps in PicoLisp without an Android SDK</b></p><p>
PilBox ("PicoLisp Box") is a generic Android App which allows to write Apps in
pure PicoLisp, without touching Java, and without the need of an Android SDK.</p><p>
You do not need to root your device. And - if you prefer - you do not need a
separate development machine (PC or laptop): All can be done in a terminal on
the device, and even in a Lisp REPL while the App is running.</p><p>
Note: <b>PilBox needs Android &gt;= 5.0!</b></p><p>
It comes with PicoLisp binaries for Arm64 pre-installed. If your device has an
Arm32 CPU, you can - after installing the PilBox App but before starting it -
download and install the emulator version <a href="https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip</a>.
If this was done by mistake, you can revert to Arm64 binaries with
<a href="https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip</a>.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>
The PilBox App itself (called the "PilBox kernel") is written in Java, the
normal Android way. It displays a WebView GUI, and starts a PicoLisp <b>binary</b>
compiled for Arm64 CPUs. This binary may now run any PicoLisp program, by
setting up a local web server where the WebView component connects to, possibly
opening a database, and doing whatever is desired.</p><p>
The PilBox kernel provides an interface to the Android Java runtime environment.
To the PicoLisp code it looks like a remote database, where Java objects are
mapped to PicoLisp DB objects, and Java functions and methods are executed via
remote procedure calls.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/457.d" alt="PilBox.png"></p><p>
If a ZIP file is passed to the PilBox kernel upon start-up, it is unpacked, and
may override or extend whatever is installed already. This is done typically by
clicking on a downloaded ZIP, or by "sharing" it from some other App.</p><p>
Then it looks for a file "App.l" in the App's working directory, <span>load</span>s it,
and listens at the port number found in a file "Port". Out of the box, "Port" is
8081, and "App.l" is a meta-App which provides a convenient runtime environment
for managing Apps installed via the ZIP mechanism.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>
You can download the PilBox App from Google Play store, or get it directly from
<a href="https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk">https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk</a>. In the latter case, you may need to
enable "Unknown Sources" in your settings.</p><p>

<span>pilBox.apk</span> contains the PilBox kernel App as an APK ("Android Package"), and
the ZIP files are small demo applications.</p><p>
Then go to Apps -&gt; PilBox -&gt; Permissions and enable "Location" and "Storage".</p><h3>The pre-installed generic App</h3><p>
Initially, when started without any ZIP file, the PilBox kernel shows an empty
white screen with a PicoLisp logo on the top-left and a settings icon on the
top-right (the screenshots were taken on a tablet, so on a phone the proportions
may differ):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/426.d" alt="emptyPilBox.png"></p><h4>The REPL</h4><p>
If you tap on the PicoLisp logo on the left, it opens a REPL (Read-Eval-Print
Loop) - a kind of terminal window into the App:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/430.d" alt="repl1.png"></p><p>
The REPL gives you control over many aspects of the App. It has a large text
field for displaying results and editing text, a single-line text field at the
bottom for command input, and the three buttons "Eval", "Edit" and "Clear
Cache".</p><p>
The main purpose is to enter commands, and look at their results in the text
area. As the "Eval" button is the first on the page, it is implicitly activated
if you hit <span>Enter</span> when typing a command.</p><p>
As a special case, if a command starts with a dollar-sign:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/431.d" alt="repl2.png"></p><p>
it is taken as a Shell command, here <span>ls -l</span>, and shows the listing in the text
area:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/432.d" alt="repl3.png"></p><p>
Otherwise (not starting with a dollar-sign), the command line is evaluated as a
Lisp expression. For example, after typing <span>(pp 'gps)</span>, we get:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/433.d" alt="repl4.png"></p><p>
If you type a file or path name like <span>App.l</span> in the command line,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/434.d" alt="repl5.png"></p><p>
and press the "Edit" button, the file is opened in the text area and may be
edited:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/435.d" alt="repl6.png"></p><p>
Press the "Done" button to close the file again.</p><p>
The "Clear Cache" button invalidates the <span>WebView</span> cache, and is useful after
changing an App's CSS file.</p><p>
Tapping on the PicoLisp logo takes you back to the start screen.</p><p>
Normally, you won't edit your App's sources in the REPL, but instead edit them
in a terminal program like <span>Termux</span> with <span>vim</span> or <span>emacs</span>, and pass them as a
ZIP file to PilBox as described below.</p><h4>Settings</h4><p>
If you tap on the settings icon on the right of the start screen, it opens a
default settings page. Initially it shows two tabs, one with all standard
PicoLisp localizations</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/436.d" alt="settings1.png"></p><p>
and one listing the installed PILs (PicoLisp Apps):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/437.d" alt="settings2.png"></p><p>
Initially the list is empty.</p><p>
The REPL behavior and the default settings page are normally overridden by
installed Apps, and are available only on the start screen.</p><h3>Installing your own App(s)</h3><p>
The empty PilBox kernel is not very useful, except for perhaps exploring the App
environment in the REPL.</p><p>
To install your own App, prepare a ZIP file with a directory containing
</p><ul>
   <li>One or more <span>*.l</span> Lisp files, where one of them must be named <span>App.l</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a CSS file named <span>lib.css</span></li>
   <li>Optionally an icon in a file named <span>logo.png</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a directory called <span>loc/</span> with localizations</li>
</ul><p>
The file <span>App.l</span> is mandatory, and is <span>load</span>ed to start the App. If one of the
<span>*.l</span> files is named <span>settings.l</span>, then it overrides the behavior of the
settings icon while this App is active.</p><p>
The first Lisp expression in <span>App.l</span> is <span>read</span> in, and should be a string
giving the App's name.</p><p>
You pass your ZIP file to the PilBox kernel by "sharing" it from another App
(e.g. the "Downloads" App). As I use the <span>Termux</span> App for local development, I
usually generate the ZIP file directly on the device, pass it to the
<span>termux-share</span> utility, using the world-readable <span>storage</span> area:
</p><pre>   $ zip -rFS ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip myApp/
   $ termux-share ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip
</pre><p>

When the PilBox kernel starts, it scans all top-level directories for other
files named "App.l". Each of those directories is taken as a PIL App. If only a
single one is found, it is started immediately, otherwise a list of buttons with
the App names is displayed.</p><h3>Hello World</h3><p>
For a minimal example for a PIL App, look at
<a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a>. It consists of a directory <span>hello/</span> with
a single file <span>App.l</span>. This file contains:
</p><pre>   "Hello World"

   (menu "Hello World!"
      (&lt;h1&gt; "center blue" "Hello World!") )
</pre><p>

The first line gives the App's name, and the <span>menu</span> expression displays a
header line in blue with "Hello World!".</p><p>
If you pass this ZIP to the PilBox kernel, it immediately shows this screen
(because it is the first and only App installed so far):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/440.d" alt="helloApp.png"></p><p>
A tap on the PicoLisp icon has no effect now (we are no longer on the PilBox
kernel start screen), but the settings page is still the default one. If we open
the "PILs" tab, we see that there is a single package "PIL-hello" installed:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/441.d" alt="helloSettings.png"></p><h3>Calculator</h3><p>
Let's move on to something more interesting than the obligatory "Hello World".
The package </p><li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li><p> contains a calculator App.</p><p>
After we pass it to the PilBox, the start screen now shows <i>two</i> Apps:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/443.d" alt="calcPilBox.png"></p><p>
The calculator can be started by hitting the topmost button:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/445.d" alt="calculator.png"></p><p>
Play with it around a little. It employs PicoLisp's big numbers, so it can only
handle integers (of unlimited size though).</p><p>
If we go to the "PILs" tab in the settings, we see that now there are two
packages,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/447.d" alt="settings3.png"></p><p>
and clicking on the "PIL-calc" link lists the package's contents:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/450.d" alt="pil-calc.png"></p><p>
The back-arrow brings you back to the "PILs" tab.</p><p>
Enabling the checkboxes in the "PILs" tab allows for the removal of the selected
packages. It removes <i>all</i> files in the package, so it must be handled with
care!</p><p>
The PilBox kernel start screen can be reached by clicking on the PicoLisp icon.
There we can also get to the REPL again.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/451.d" alt="repl7.png"></p><h3>The Demo App</h3><p>
Finally, there is <a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a>, an extensive but rather
silly Demo App. It contains examples for conventional GUI components, as they
are needed in database applications,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/452.d" alt="demoFields.png"></p><p>
but also or accessing the Android toolbox, like taking pictures or scanning
QR-Codes, reading GPS coordinates, and posting notifications:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/454.d" alt="demoNotify.png"></p><p>
Feel free to install it, play around, and study the code.</p><h3>Using the Android API</h3><p>
PilBox is only useful if it can communicate with the Android API on the device.
Therefore, it loads the Android library "lib/android.l" in the PicoLisp
distribution (which in turn is built upon the Java reflection API).</p><p>
The central function in "lib/android.l" is <span>java</span>. It maps Lisp function calls
to the Java virtual machine, supporting eight types of calls:
</p><pre>   (java "cls" 'T ['any ..]) -&gt; obj       New object
   (java 'obj 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any      Send message to object
   (java 'obj "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any    Value of object field
   (java "cls" 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any     Call method in class
   (java "cls" "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any   Value of class field
   (java T "cls" ["cls" ..]) -&gt; obj       Define interface
   (java 'obj) -&gt; [lst ..]                Reflect object
   (java "cls") -&gt; cls                    Get class
</pre><p>

Depending on the type of the first one or two arguments (transient symbol,
internal symbol, or <span>T</span>) it behaves differently.</p><p>
This is not trivial, and requires some understanding of the Java side. For
example, to aquire a <span>WakeLock</span>, Java code samples do
</p><pre>   PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
   WakeLock wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyWakelockTag");
   wakeLock.acquire();
</pre><p>

To implement the same in PicoLisp, we must first look up the constant values
<span>POWER_SERVICE</span> and <span>PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</span>. They are found in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE</a>
as "power" and in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a>
as 1. With that, the corresponding Lisp code is:
</p><pre>   (java
      (java (java CONTEXT 'getSystemService "power") 'newWakeLock 1 "MyWakelockTag")
      'acquire )
</pre><p>

The gobal constant <span>CONTEXT</span> is defined in …</p></div></div>

</div>
      
      <p>If you like circles, spheres and shapes that fit nicely together, you’ll probably like spherical circle packings. In this post, I’ll describe how I turned one into a lamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A circle packing is an arrangement of circles that fit tightly together, so that no circle can be enlarged without causing overlaps. Circle packing is a nice mathematical rabbit hole<sup id="fnref:circle_packing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:circle_packing">1</a></sup>, but this post focuses on Steiner chains, which is the type of packing I used for building the lamp (more pictures of which can be found <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/circle-lamp">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="steiner-chains">Steiner chains</h2>

<p>A Steiner chain<sup id="fnref:steiner_chain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steiner_chain">2</a></sup> is constructed by surrounding a circle with a ring of additional circles that are all also tangent to a larger circle. In other words, a Steiner chain consists of circles packed in a circle (a concept I’ve previously explored in <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/copper-circles">this project</a>).</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.png" alt="A simple Steiner chain.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>A simple Steiner chain with a center circle surrounded by a ring of 9 smaller circles, all tangent to the bounding circle (dashed).</p>
  
</div>

<p>The fact that a Steiner chain fits tightly in a circle can be used to construct nested packings by repeatedly replacing the center circle with a smaller Steiner chain. Here’s an animation illustrating the idea.</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.gif" alt="Nesting Steiner chains">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>Nesting Steiner chains.</p>
  
</div>

<p>The lamp is built from a total of 13 circles, forming a nested Steiner chain with two rings, each containing 6 circles.</p>

<h2 id="deforming-a-circle-packing">Deforming a circle packing</h2>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that a circle packing can’t be arbitrarily deformed without “ruining” it. For example, stretching a packing in one direction turns the circles into ellipses. Luckily, there is a class of circle preserving planar deformations, so called Möbius transformations<sup id="fnref:mobius_transformation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mobius_transformation">3</a></sup>, that can be used to parametrically control the shape of a circle packing. This is really useful for parametric design purposes.</p>

    </p>
    
  
  <p>Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.</p>
  
</div>

<h2 id="going-spherical">Going spherical</h2>

<p>The Möbius transformations described in the previous section turn out to be the only options for transforming a circle packing in the plane. However, if we venture into three dimensional space, there is another option: <em>inverse stereographic projection</em><sup id="fnref:stereographic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stereographic">4</a></sup>. Loosely speaking, this transformation can be used to wrap a circle packing around a sphere.</p>

<p>For this project, I put together a parametric design tool to explore interesting spherical circle packings. This tool generates packings in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a nested Steiner chain</li>
  <li>Apply a Möbius transformation</li>
  <li>Wrap the packing around a sphere using inverse stereographic projection</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an animation showing the tool in action.</p>

<h2 id="generating-the-blueprint">Generating the blueprint</h2>

<p>The previous sections outline a method for creating nice spherical circle packings. In order to create physical objects from these packings, I wrote some code for procedural generation of laser cutter blueprints. One cruical thing to keep in mind when making a pendant lamp is the center of mass. To ensure the lamp is hanging properly, the center of mass and the wire hole need to lie on the same vertical line. The center of mass calculation is simplified by the fact that it only has to deal with circles (the contribution from the joints is negligible).</p>

<h2 id="building-the-lamp">Building the lamp</h2>

<p>Once I had generated a blueprint and manufactured the parts, assembling the lamp went pretty smoothly. All circles, joints and joint holes were numbered so I would not have to think too much during assembly.</p>

                    <p>Starting a newsletter is exciting. I remember my first newsletter about remote work back in 2015. It was so cool having an actual audience of people to write to every week. It was like I had my own TV show or magazine or something. I later on realized that you could actually make money from this by finding people who would pay you for sponsoring or having an ad in your newsletter. Now, I'll share that with you how.</p><h2 id="my-story-short-version-">My story (short version)</h2><p>Since then I've progressed to running <a href="https://klart.io/pixels">Pixels</a>, a newsletter with curated designs and I'm sending it to more than 4000 people every week making money through sponsors.</p><p>Here's what I've learned.</p><p>Good question. As I see it, a sponsor is paying you money because they like what you're doing and they want to be related to you, in some way. You can see it as a mutual agreement, which both parties enjoy, possibly for a longer period of time.</p><p>Ads are more like a transactional thing. X pay money to Y to be have something displayed in front of people.</p><p>Everyone doesn't want to monetize their newsletter and that's cool. I've started a few myself just for fun and because I like writing and curating interesting content. But if you do want to earn money I think sponsors are the way to go. Read on!</p><p>There's really no number on how many subscribers you need to be able to land your first sponsor. Personally I got my first sponsor for Pixels at about a thousand subscribers but I could probably have reached out way sooner than that. If I was starting fresh today, I'd probably start to reach out when I'm around 100 subscribers. It's good to build relationships early, and companies are not stupid so they won't pay if they don't like what's in it for them anyway. Worst thing you can get is a no.</p><h2 id="define-your-audience">Define your audience</h2><p>One of the most important things when reaching out to potential sponsors is that you've defined your audience. Who's reading your newsletter? Are they developers? designers? photographers? yoga instructors? This will be key, so better figure this one out.</p><h2 id="find-relevant-companies">Find relevant companies</h2><p>When you go out looking for potential sponsors you shouldn't just "find any company". If your sponsor is not aligned with your readers it will probably come out in a weird spammy way as those old banner ads in the 90's. &nbsp;This will lead to poor ad performance and unhappy subscribers and sponsors. Everybody lose.</p><p>If you however manage to find a relevant sponsors, for example a new database system as a sponsor for your newsletter about open source, your readers will probably find it interesting, and your sponsor will get great ad performance. Win-win!</p><h2 id="who-should-you-email">Who should you email?</h2><p>This depends a little bit. I've found that it's a lot easier to get a referral down rather than up. So start with the CEO if it's a relatively small company and otherwise, try the marketing manager.</p><p>If you can't find an email address to anyone, try the general info email and ask who you should contact about email sponsorships. There are services like <a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a> that you can use to find email addresses to people given a domain name.</p><h2 id="reach-out">Reach out</h2><p>Found a bunch of relevant companies to reach out to? Great! Now it's time to send a few emails.</p><p>Since you've already defined your audience this will be easy. In the subject, state what the company will get out of your offering and explain this further in your email.</p><p>This is an example of a first outreach email to sponsors for a newsletter about mobile cameras:</p><figure><pre><code>Subject: Reach Hobby Photographers

Hi Company!

My name is Foo from Bar. I run a weekly newsletter about the latest trends in mobile cameras.

Since you're making an app to develop photos I figured you would enjoy reaching this audience.

Are you interested in an exclusive sponsorship?

Best,

Foo</code></pre><figcaption>Example outreach email</figcaption></figure><p>Keep it short, personal and mention your audience. If they're interested they will probably get back to you for more information.</p><h2 id="follow-up-follow-up-follow-up">Follow-up, Follow-up, Follow-up</h2><p>Most of the time you'll probably not get a reply on the first email and that's why you have to follow-up. You might have heard this before but I can't stress this enough. It has happened so many times that I've closed a deal on the 7th or 8th email 3 months or so after I sent the first one.</p><p>Keep track of everything in a spreadsheet, one column for the email, one for the next follow-up. I usually do something like this:</p><ul><li>First email</li><li>After 3 days: Second email</li><li>Another 4 days: Third email</li><li>Another 5 days: Fourth email</li><li>... At least make it here. Bonus points for continuing...</li></ul><p>One you start doing this at scale you might want to consider a CRM system to not get completely overwhelmed by all your follow-ups. This is also the reason I started <a href="https://wobaka.com/">Wobaka</a>, to make automating follow-ups and keeping track of contacts super smooth.</p><h2 id="make-it-easy-for-them">Make it easy for them</h2><p>Once you do get a reply from someone you should make it super easy for them. Sponsoring you is probably a very small piece of their marketing budget so it's essential that the process is smooth, otherwise they could just increase their Twitter or Facebook ad budget instead, right?</p><p>Have a payment link ready that they can use, propose a date and state what you need from them. Don't bother with calendars and booking apps. Keep it simple. You can use a tool like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> or <a href="https://paypal.com/">Paypal</a> for the payments.</p><p>This is an example for our photographer newsletter:</p><figure><pre><code>Subject: Re: Reaching Hobby Photographers

Thanks for getting back to me!

There are currently 1257 people reading the newsletter every friday. Open rate is 51% and click rate is 27%. This is an example: LINK

The sponsorship is AMOUNT and I'd be happy have you on as early as next week. If that's interesting I need the following for the ad:

- Title: Short
- Text: Less than 300 characters
- Image: 16:9 aspect ratio, png format

You can use this link for payment: LINK.

To reserve your spot I need the payment, the rest is ok to deliver a day or two before the newsletter.

Best,

Foo</code></pre><figcaption>Sponsorship details email example</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-much-should-you-charge">How much should you charge?</h2><p>I strongly advice not getting into CPM and the likes. This is because I really don't think it's the same to appear in a generic Google or Facebook ad compared to backing a newsletter their potential customers actually enjoy reading. I would stick to fixed prices per newsletter.</p><p>About the price, I actually advice you to shoot from the hip. Try something, if it works, maybe raise it, if not, maybe lower it. Keep experimenting!</p><h2 id="don-t-listen-to-the-negative-folks">Don't listen to the negative folks</h2><p>Most people will be happy that you've got sponsors. That just means that you'll be able to spend more time writing the newsletter they love. Some people may however don't like it. It has never happened to me but I've heard about it. If it happens to you, just don't bother, instead focus on all the people you can spend more time writing to!</p><h2 id="enjoy-the-process-">Enjoy the process!</h2><p>Writing a newsletter is super rewarding. I love reading comments on how people enjoy reading mine. I hope you'll be able to keep writing and maybe even make a living on your newsletter.</p><p>Best of luck!</p><p><em>Fredrik</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Google is the biggest internet company in the world today.&nbsp; And it seems that this giant, successful company is going to have a birthday. As a present, we came up with a few interesting facts in honor of the birthday <b>big boy</b> company.</p>
<h2>1. People do not seem to know Google’s exact birth date.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true. People do not know the exact date of Google’s birthday. It has been reported that Google has been given six different dates for their official birthday. Eventually they decided they need a fixed date, so that people know when to celebrate. Google later determined that <b>September 27th</b> will be the day.</p>
<h2>2. Google may even happen to be 25 years old.</h2>
<p>There are some indications that the real birth date might come even earlier than ’98. Google could be in fact, over the age needed to purchase alcohol in the US, legally. Although Google already has encoded their official starting date with the cryptic “98 9 27” doodle, it all must have started even earlier. In 1995, in the dormitory of Standford, the two main Google guys initiated the miracle power behind the most popular search engine in the world. Some say that during the infant years of Google development, the two founding men were frequently in disagreement with each other. However, we have the search engine today as proof they eventually shook hands and decided to put aside their differences and get to work.</p>
<h2>3. Google has a T-rex dinosaur on-site as a special reminder.</h2>
<div><p>Indeed, there is a T-rex on-site at Google’s headquarters. The dyno structure features a bone from a real Tyrannosaurus. When an amateur paleontologist initially discovered the bone by accident, they thought it comes from a different type of dinosaur. Stan, the name of the bone construction, is a vivid reminder that adaptation is key to survival.</p><p>Apart from being a preferred gathering <a href="https://www.demilked.com/google-campus-dinosaur-stan-flamingos/" target="_blank">spot for flamingos meeting</a>, Stan is there to remind Google employees they need to give their best all the time. Or risk having their company become extinct, just like a dinosaur.</p></div>
<h2>4. A T-rex game likes to hide in Google Chrome.</h2>
<div><p>Google is fond of dinosaurs, we noticed. Apart from the giant structure at their HQ, they also made a digital dyno version. When you browse the net on Google Chrome, a warning will appear about Google not being able to connect.</p><p>When the dinosaur is visible, if you push the space bar on your keyboard, a game will begin where you are a running dinosaur jumping over obstacles. The game length is theoretically infinite and has been an arena for peculiar competition for the highest score.</p></div>
<h2>5. Many things are hiding in Google’s products.</h2>
<p>You can find many Google easter eggs by doing a simple search. These hidden gems become quite apparent once you begin to understand what they are.&nbsp; For example, searching with the word “askew” will return search results in a tilted view. You can also try “zerg rush,” “blink HTML” or the classic “Google in the 1998”.</p>
<h2>6. Google was not at all pleased that the name of the company became a generic search term.</h2>
<p>“Google” and “just Google it” are common words, but the company thought that could undermine all their efforts. There is, however, no way to stop such a trend. We have little control over how language use evolves. Marketing departments would say they want the brand name should circulate as much as possible. Still, Google has reached a level where the term becomes forever embedded in our culture. At this point, the process of “genericization” becomes unstoppable and out of control, even Google’s.</p>
<h2>7. Google devours more businesses than people genuinely think.</h2>
<p>Some estimate that Google purchases more than one company per week. Most of the companies tend to be small, but some can be rather large. Most of the acquired products get blended in with others that are already part of an applied marketing strategy.&nbsp; However, Android resides firmly within Google’s realm on its own accord and is very well known.<br>Google does not usually sell the companies that it buys. </p>
<h2>8. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” Google button cost more than tens of millions of dollars per year.</h2>
<p>This button is really fun. But for Google, it is an expensive add-on. The simple task of taking a person directly to the top result page without the advertising makes Google miss a lot of potential revenue. That lost income estimates put it at around $110 million. When addressed directly, Google officials responded that without the feeling lucky button Google will look like a corporate beast with an exclusive focus on money. The fact that the button remains on the main google page is a true testament that Google understands the search engine is for the real people out there.</p>
<h2>9. The first Google storage building blocks come from Lego.</h2>
<p>Google, one of the largest companies in the world today, has many demands, most of them understandably also pretty big. For example, all the countless public photos, videos and emails needs a place to stay, and there are building-size structures that come to the rescue. But back in 1996, things were different for the Google founders, when they had to find a solution for their first storage device need. The hard drives they found were too bulky, so they produced unique server boxes made out of Lego parts.</p>
<h2>10. Google proves to be very generous to the spouses of employees who die while working for the company.</h2>
<p>Losing a loved one on the job is always tough. Dying while working in a comfortable, air-conditioned office is not the same as, say, a coal mine accident. However, one thing is sure: death comes unexpectedly, and it is a hard stone to all sides involved. Google understands that and pays the husband or wife of the decreased fifty percent of their salary for the next ten years! Even the children of those unfortunate enough to perish on the job have benefits too – they are set with compensatory payments till they reach adulthood.</p>
<h2>11. One search on Google requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts of Apollo 11 to the moon. </h2>
<div><p>Isn’t that a funny statistic? Searching with Google is made so simple now. Most people don’t believe when they hear the actual computing and networking power behind every simple search querry.</p><p>Searching the internet today takes more resources than were necessary to put people on the moon. Even your smartphone has better capabilities than the equipment NASA had when they attempted the first moonwalk. </p></div>
<h2>12. One time Google experienced a crash for five minutes, and almost half of the whole internet went down too.</h2>
<div><p>What if you can’t use your computer for five minutes? No bid deal, right? You can take a walk and come back again. Five minutes for Google is too much.</p><p>It was on August 19, 2013, when the famed Google stopped operating for a total of five minutes. This short interruption sufficed for Google to take down around 40% of all internet traffic.</p><p>While it is true that many companies have risen to the occasion and provide search opportunities for people, Google still dominates the more substantial part of the internet. Google has grown to the point where it almost became a synonym for the internet itself. When Google has a problem, the chances are that so does most of the world wide web.</p></div>
<h2>13. Google employs goats.</h2>
<div><p>There is a lot of beautiful green space around Google offices. And that could require a lot of mowing for sure. So they come up with the ingenious idea to have some goats to take care of the grass for them.</p><p>According to Google employees, they love goats because for a score of reasons. Goats are not as noisy, don’t cause any pollution, and, most of all, are more cure and cuddly than lawnmowers.</p></div>
<h2>14. Google has lots of dogs on site.</h2>
<div><p>Speaking of goats, Google also loves all kinds of animals and lets people bring their pets to work. Having your best friend around you is a huge booster for morale and productivity.</p><p>Note that cats are not banned from Google. It’s just that cats don’t usually get along with dogs, so there are fewer of them on-site. But there are still quite a few.</p></div>
<h2>15. Google has given a dog the title of Top Dog.</h2>
<p>According to Google’s official history, the dog of the owner of Google, whose name is Yoshka, is the first and only dog to be given the name Top Dog back in 1999. A post appeared on Google by Yoshka, stating that all dogs are welcome to come to Google. Yoshka is not the only dog in the company, but it was the first. The dog owner was non-other than Urs Hölzle. He was the person responsible for reducing the power needed for Google data centers by half!</p>
<h2>16. Google centered their logo on the main search page in 2001.</h2>
<div><p>Google’s homepage is simple, a much-needed requirement when millions around the world visit it on a daily. Any changes to that page, even the tiniest ones, will be indeed significantly noticed.</p><p>In the early days of the search engine, the Google logo resided to the left side of the page. But in 2001, they moved it to the center and has been there ever since. This seemingly slight change is pretty significant. It changed how the main page is perceived forever.</p></div>
<h2>17. Google continues to make small changes.</h2>
<div><p>There have been some rather small adjustments to the Google logo, in time. Those changes include the layout of the letters of the word “Google.”</p><p>Small changes are the general approach, but Google also goes big. They came up with different ways to arrange the words, which included a new font too.</p></div>
<h2>18. Changes include the name.</h2>
<p>In recent years, the most significant and notable change occurred when the company changed its name from Google to Alphabet. That change was prompted by the fact the company was dominating most of the search, information, internet and other aspects of the business.</p>
<h2>19. Google Instant.</h2>
<p>Google Instant means that you will see results immediately as soon as you start typing if your connection allows it.&nbsp; Google can then collect ample information on you about your browsing patterns to get you where you want to go even faster. Google Instant changes the autocomplete options, and the suggested search results in an …</p></div></div>

<p>He had a bell tied to his computer. Every time he made a sale, the bell would chime. Amazon started out selling only books, and sales back then were only far and between.</p>
<p>Eventually, the bell started chiming continiously, and he had to take it down.</p>
<p>A lot of popular software tools have similar functionality built in. Each time you get a new subscriber, Mailchimp sends you an alert email. Each time you make a sale, Stripe sends you a payment notification.</p>
<p>When you first start making stuff online, there's no better feeling than knowing that someone out there wants to pay money to use your product or follow your work. And there's no better pick-me-up when you've had a tough day.</p>
<p>I have a similar set up for one of my apps. Each time a customer upgrades to a "premium" plan, I have a script that randomly fetches a gif from Giphy with the keyword "money". This is then included in an email that contains information about who bought, what they bought, and how munch money I made. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/founder-dopamine-hits/alert_email.gif" alt="Sample Alert Email"></p>
<p>I've had this setup for more than a couple of years now, and these emails are still the highlight of my days. But as much as I enjoy getting these emails, I hope I'll eventually reach a point where I'll have to turn them off. </p>
<p>I guess for now, these dopamine hits will have to do.</p>

for EHLO hostnames too</a>. The conventional explanation
for this (apart from 'big email providers say so', the usual reason
to do anything in modern SMTP) comes from, for example, <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2020/07/small-mailserver-bcp/">this
writeup of small mailserver best current practices</a>,
and goes like this (I'm paraphrasing):</p>

<p>People use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>
to validate the envelope sender domain (the SMTP MAIL FROM). However,
when you send a bounce, it has a null sender and thus no sender
domain to use for SPF checks. So the sender domain is taken from
the EHLO hostname, for lack of a better place to get it from (since
there is no SMTP level 'the bounce claims to have been sent by X
domain' information to be had, although this is commonly in the
message headers).</p>

<p>This is of course kind of bogus. What is really happening here is that
receiving mail servers are attempting to validate that the EHLO/HELO
hostname itself is not forged and are using SPF for this purpose. This
is a complete repurposing of SPF, which we can see since 'Sender' is
right in the name 'Sender Policy Framework' and there's no 'sender' of
the bounce that is visible at the SMTP level (and no entirely standard
way that it's visible in the mail headers, either).</p>

<p>There are some lessons here for email related 'standards' and in general
any Internet standards, which I can summarize this way: if there's a
hole that people think needs filling, any nearby peg will get hammered
into it regardless of what the peg was originally designed for.</p>

<p>PS: This elaborates on <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1307064512302940161">a recent tweet of mine</a> that was
sparked by adding SPF DNS records for our EHLO hostnames (and writing
the official explanation of the change for our records).</p>

<h3>Sidebar: This explanation and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208">RFC 7208</a></h3>

<p>RFC 7208 says two things in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-2.3">section 2.3, <em>The "HELO" Identity</em></a>:</p>

<ul><li>it's RECOMMENDED that you check the HELO identity (but carefully)
all the time, and do so before checking MAIL FROM.</li>
<li>if the envelope sender is the null sender, the message is presumed
to come from 'postmaster@&lt;HELO name&gt;' and this is used as the
MAIL FROM to check (even if you already checked the HELO identity).</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't gone through RFC 7208's section on doing SPF checks to see
if it treats HELO and MAIL FROM checks somewhat differently in its
algorithm, because frankly I'm not interested enough.</p>

<p>This means that RFC 7208 itself is a superset of the conventional
explanation I summarized above. In RFC 7208, you have SPF records
for your EHLO hostnames both because of bounces and because receivers
are recommended to check them all the time. This implies that all
of your mail sending machines should have SPF records, not just the
ones that can send bounces.</p>

<p>(Now that I've looked that up, I may need to update some of our
DNS records. Again.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>We rebooted all of our servers remotely (more or less) and it all worked</h2>

	<p><small>September 26, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Even under normal circumstances, we don't routinely reboot our Linux
servers. Reboots are disruptive to our users (especially to the
people who are logged in to the servers that reboot), and local
policies require us to schedule an after-hours downtime for large
scale user visible things like this, which is disruptive to our
lives. We do reboot them periodically, either for significant enough
Ubuntu kernel security issues or just because we want to get them
back on up to date kernels. However, all of this is under normal
circumstances, when we are actually physically in the office to
deal with machines that fail to go down or come up cleanly.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">The current situation is not normal</a>. We've been out
of the office since early March, and even in March our systems had
been rather a while since a reboot (through the magic of our
Prometheus metrics and dashboards, I can tell you that at the end
of March 12th, the last day I was in the office, most of our systems
had been up for about 259 days).  Since we were out of the office,
we didn't even think about rebooting for a very long time, and by
early September many of our machines had been up for over 400 days
without a reboot. Things reached a critical point and we (by which
I mean my co-workers, as I was on vacation) decided that we should
take the risk to reboot everything, while taking some steps to
mitigate the risks for very important machines.</p>

<p>(Said steps being that the reboot of those machines was scheduled for
early morning, when a co-worker who is an extreme morning person would
stop by the office.)</p>

<p>What happened was, well, nothing. Everything rebooted quietly,
everything came back up again without problems, and I believe that the
co-worker in the office didn't need to do anything. The not as user
visible machines that we rebooted before hand all worked, the user
visible machines that we rebooted during the downtime worked too, and
none of our fears came to pass.</p>

<p>(Well, we did discover a machine or two with odd BIOS settings
that caused problems, but they weren't particularly user visible
machines; they were generic machines in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SlurmHasCreatedCattle">our SLURM cluster</a>.)</p>

<p>It would be nicer to have remote power control and a KVM over IP setup
for all of our machines, so that we could deal with everything from
home; that would make reboots almost completely risk free (and an
unexpected hardware failure is hard to deal with during a scheduled
downtime anyway). But it's reassuring to have a positive experience
even just with the basics. It will also probably encourage us to do it
again, sooner than last time around.</p>

<p>(Also, it's nice for a potentially risky operation to just work.
A quiet day is its own reward, and sometimes our small successes
deserve a little celebration.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community. I hope all these information can help people to understand the situation, and help potential contributors to take part in.</p><p>Of course, Rust on LLVM has gone so far away, but what would I

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

<p>In this week's post, you will learn how to build a command line tool that
manipulates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In this example, I have medical data on some hospital patients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>data.csv</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>id,height_ft,weight_lb,glucose_mgdL
PT-9357,5.96,189,124
PT-5315,5.53,180,106
PT-7733,6.15,222,126
PT-9667,6.10,174,104
PT-8893,6.00,232,98
PT-1125,5.97,187,85
PT-1222,5.82,237,104
PT-7681,6.00,198,134
PT-7043,5.98,227,78
PT-2623,5.55,204,125
PT-7031,5.50,216,107
PT-4947,5.91,199,105
PT-9711,6.13,237,107
PT-3737,6.03,179,111
PT-2931,5.78,187,87
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what the columns mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> - the patient's id number.</li>
<li><code>height_ft</code> - the patient's height (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)">ft</a>).</li>
<li><code>weight_lb</code> - the patient's weight in (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)">lb</a>).</li>
<li><code>glucose_mgdL</code> - the patient's fasting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">blood glucose</a> levels (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#SI_multiples">mg</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre#SI_prefixes_applied_to_the_litre">dL</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>From this data, I want to make several calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to calculation the patients' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">body mass index</a> (BMI) from their
height and weight.</li>
<li>I want to classify the patients' weight based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a>, e.g. "obese",
"underweight".</li>
<li>I want to classify the patients' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes">diabetic status</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">blood
glucose</a>, e.g. "diabetic", "prediabetic".</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how I can use <code>csv-proc</code> to accomplish this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ./csv-proc data.csv '
_height_m = float(row.height_ft) * 0.3048
_weight_kg = float(row.weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = _weight_kg / _height_m ** 2
bmi = round(bmi, 1)
if bmi &lt; 18.5:
    bmi_cat = "underweight"
elif 18.5 &lt;= bmi &lt; 25:
    bmi_cat = "normal"
elif 25 &lt;= bmi &lt; 30:
    bmi_cat = "overweight"
elif 30 &lt;= bmi:
    bmi_cat = "obese"

_glucose_mgdL = float(row.glucose_mgdL)
if _glucose_mgdL &lt; 100:
    glucose_cat = "normal"
elif 100 &lt;= _glucose_mgdL &lt; 126:
    glucose_cat = "prediabetic"
elif 126 &lt;= _glucose_mgdL:
    glucose_cat = "diabetic"
'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(This uses the functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round">round</a>.)</p>
<p>I could also accomplish this by defining some helper functions using the
<code>--init</code> flag:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ./csv-proc data.csv '

_height_m = N(row.height_ft) * 0.3048
_weight_kg = N(row.weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = round(_weight_kg / _height_m ** 2, 1)
bmi_cat = classify_bmi(bmi)
_glucose_mgdL = N(row.glucose_mgdL)
glucose_cat = classify_glucose(_glucose_mgdL)

' --init '

from bisect import bisect_right
from functools import partial

N = float

def classify(x, *, cutoff, label):
    return label[bisect_right(cutoff, x)]

classify_bmi = partial(
    classify,
    cutoff=[18.5, 25, 30],
    label="underweight normal overweight obese".split(),
)

classify_glucose = partial(
    classify,
    cutoff=[100, 126],
    label="normal prediabetic diabetic".split(),
)

<p>(This uses functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial">functools.partial</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_right">bisect.bisect_right</a>.)</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
The method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer.sniff">csv.Sniffer.sniff</a> analyzes a sample of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> and guesses the "dialect" (delimiter, quoting, etc.).
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader">csv.DictReader</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter">csv.DictWriter</a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader">csv.reader</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer">csv.writer</a> because I want to expose the rows as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionaries</a> instead</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> to prepare text to be executed as code by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a>.
To determine the new columns to add to the output, I examine how
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict">collections.OrderedDict</a> <code>env_local</code> changes after processing a row.
I ignore local variables that start with <code>_</code> because I wanted an easy way to
create "temporary variables" that won't show up in the output.</p>
<p>When I process each row of the input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>, I create a <code>RowProxy</code> object
that allows accessing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionary</a> entries as attributes. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp = RowProxy({"cat": 3})
rp["cat"]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp.cat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to a command line tool that manipulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>, as well as how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer">csv.Sniffer</a> to automatically deduce the
"dialect" of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>.
You also learned how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a> to run text as Python code.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a tool like <code>csv-proc</code> that allows you to filter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>
based on some criteria.
For example, if you only want to view prediabetic patients from <strong>data.csv</strong>,
you could call your program like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ csv-filter data.csv '100 &lt;= float(row.glucose_mgdL) &lt; 126'
</code></pre>

(<a href="https://github.com/shaunlebron/pacman-mazegen">code on GitHub</a>)
</p>


<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>

<h2><span>Work in Progress</span></h2>
<p>
<i>
Generating random Pac-Man mazes is a deceptively difficult problem that I spent some months working on.  It is not easy to describe clearly.  I hope you are patient.  This page is an effort to begin communicating how the algorithm works.  It will slowly be refined (your feedback appreciated) until it is all stated as clearly as possible.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contraints</h2>
<p>
The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Map is 28x31 tiles.</li>
<li>Paths are only 1 tile thick</li>
<li>No sharp turns (i.e. intersections are separated by atleast 2 tiles).</li>
<li>There are 1 or 2 tunnels</li>
<li>No dead-ends.</li>
<li>Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the occasional rectangular wall.</li>
<li>Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's like Tetris</h2>

<p>
We start by stacking tetris pieces on a 5x9 grid. Gravity pulls the pieces in the left direction rather than down.  The edges of the resulting tetris pieces correspond to walkable paths in the maze.  This grid is then mirrored across the left vertical axis to create a symmetric map, then scaled by 3 to form an original-size 28x31 map.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
For clarity, I call the squares in the initial 5x9 grid, <b>cells</b>, and the squares in the final 28x31 grid, <b>tiles</b>.  So, this algorithm first creates the <b>cells</b> and transforms them into <b>tiles</b>
</p>

<h2>Simple Model</h2>

<p>
Shown in the above diagram titled "Simple Model" is the 5x9 grid of tetris pieces.  The pieces are created one cell at a time using some algorithm to limit the type of pieces at certain locations (they are numbered to show the order of creation).
</p>

<p>
The ghost pen and the edge between rows 7 and 8 at column 1 are present in every map, since the starting location of Pac-Man and the ghost pen location are constant.
</p>

<h2>Height and Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>
Cells are directly transformed into a 3x3 group of tiles. Unfortunately, this creates a resulting map that is too short by 1 tile and too wide by 1 tile.  So, we increase the height of one cell for every column, and decrease the width of one cell for every row, allowing the generated map to fit in the exact dimensions of the original game.
</p>

<p>
Shown in the above diagrams titled "Height Adjustments" and "Width Adjustments", the highlighted cells are the candidate cells whose size can be changed without creating ugly walls (i.e. walls that have non-uniform thickness).
</p>

<p>
Arrows occupy cells which have been chosen for size adjustment.  Care is taken to prevent discontinuities in the edges as a result of the shifting of cells from the size change.
</p>

<h2>Border Cells and Tunnels</h2>

<p>
I won't explain too much about this right now.  But the above diagram titled "Border Cells and Tunnels" has arrows to indicate the tunnel candidates.  The highlighted cells show the type of tunnel candidates by color.  Some cell edges are erased to create some variation in how walls connect with the boundary of the map (shown in green).  The tunnel creation algorithm is sophisticated in how it chooses different types of tunnels.
</p>

<h2>Final Paths</h2>

<p>
When the cells are finally transformed into tiles, what you are left with is shown in the diagram above titled "Final Paths".  Here you can directly map a cell to a 3x3 group of tiles.  You can even pick out the cells whose height are width have been adjusted by 1 tile in this map.
</p>

<h2>Final Tiles</h2>

<p>
See how the above diagram titled "Final Tiles" differs from "Final Paths".  The paths are shifted from the tile <em>edges</em> toward the tile <em>centers</em>.  Each tile with a path going through its center is turned into a path tile.  Finally, any tile that touches a path tile becomes a wall tile.  The map structure is now complete.

<p>Terra Nil is a relaxing city builder about ecosystem reconstruction.</p>
<p>Turn a barren wasteland into an ecological paradise complete with different flora and fauna, then clean up after yourself to leave the environment pristine.&nbsp;This strategy game/city builder/puzzler subverts the conventional goal of the city builder genre.&nbsp;Terra Nil is about the restoration of a ravaged environment, where the lightest touch is best.</p>

<p>The whole game can be played with the mouse:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>left/right click select/deselect</li><li>middle button to pan&nbsp;</li><li>scroll wheel to rotate / zoom</li></ul>
<p>There are also keyboard controls:</p>
<ul><li>arrows or wasd to pan&nbsp;</li><li>z/x to zoom&nbsp;</li><li>r to rotate</li></ul>

<p>We live in a world where we are being looked at all the time. I say “looked at” because that kind of sounds less harsh compared to “tracked and surveilled”. The phones and smart devices that we ourselves make sure are with us all the time are always listening to us - even when we are no talking to them. Google and Apple, even Instagram and Tiktok, know where you are all the time even when you are not even using their apps. Google has access to all your emails and can shut you out of your life just because. You cannot escape the Facebook mafia. If you stop using Facebook, they catch you with Instagram. If you don’t use Instagram they will catch you with Whatsapp. If you somehow even escape that. Facebook now owns “Giphy”  the gif search engine that is built in your phone keyboard. Hell, let’s say you don’t even use that they can track you with their integrations in every single website and app that you are using. They have a profile of you even if you never made it and it is more detailed than it would have been if you have provided that data yourself. </p>
<p>All conveniences come at a <em>tradeoff</em>. You have to give up something to get something in return. We as a society have, for most cases out of ignorance and in many cases willingly, traded our privacy for the benefits that the technologies provide. We allow apps, websites, and devices to constantly gather data about us which they can then use to profile us and subsequently sell more products to us using targeted advertising. And if you think that you, an adult, are impervious to advertising and are not influenced by it one bit then you, my friend, are wrong. Billions of dollars would not have been spent on advertising every year if you, the target, was not affected by it. With the advent of sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Google as a whole which know every single thing about you they know with much high precision which ad to show you and when. Technology has become so very advanced that it can now show you the ad for a product which you yourself don’t know that you need.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="How I keep ads away from me" src="https://akhil.me/uploads/images/Privacy%20ads.jpg">
<figcaption>Ads all around us</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you really don’t give it much thought, it doesn’t seem to be that big a deal. Sure they are collecting data on us but what’s the harm in that. Targeted advertising, theoretically, should be beneficial to us considering it takes away the pain of finding a product ourselves by showing as ads of products we are more likely to buy. Sure we might be persuaded to buy something that we didn’t really need but that has been done by pushy, persistent salespeople for ages. If you really think like this, and only like this, then the benefits of using tech if well worth the loss of privacy which even happens behind the scenes. </p>
<p>I, for one, am somewhat of a <em>privacy-conscious</em> person. I am not saying that I do not use new tech or tools that have the capability of tracking. I still use Gmail and a smartphone as well as many such apps or sites that I know for a fact are tracking me. But every such instance has been a decision on my part and not blind submission. </p>
<p>My first stance is to avoid using anything that can track me and invade my privacy. I do not use any social media platform directly at all. Any and all posts that you see on my Social Media come from a syndication app that allows me to not have social media apps on my phone. I do not install unnecessary apps and regularly delete apps that I don’t see myself using frequently. </p>
<p>Then come the things I have to use because the disruption of quality of life by not using them is much higher than the threshold that I have set for privacy. I will have to use Gmail, Whatsapp, and Amazon. I will have to visit other sites that use all sorts of tracking scripts. For these items, I have measures that ensure that I let as little tracking data go out as I can. It starts with only using a privacy-centric, ad-blocking browser on all platforms and goes to extent of having actual physical hardware whose sole purpose is to block tracking, ads, and malicious scripts from even reaching my network. I have gone to the extent of even self-hosting my own DNS to the amount of data any third party DNS provider can theoretically capture. I have, by doing this, found a balance between being able to enjoy the convenience that comes with using tech and knowing that I have not entirely given up on my privacy. The ability to completely De-Google, De-Amazon or De-Facebook myself would have been nice but this is a satisfactory second best. </p>
<p>I am listing down all the things/actions that I personally follow broken down into basic and advanced on the basis of how easy they are to setup. Everyone should be doing everything mentioned in the Basic section at the very least and as much as possible from the advanced section.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use adblockers</strong> - You will immediately see how much your life will get better as soon as you install the adblocker on your browser. Not only will you be saved from all the ads and annoying popups but your webpages will start loading much faster. Below you can see how much ad content is being pushed to you by the sites that you use daily. I recommend uBlock Origin which you can download here - <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation</a>. Download the version specific to your browser.</li>
<li><strong>Use a better browser</strong> - Chrome is good. Really good. But it is still a product of Google which they own and control. If you want the best features of Chrome without the privacy issues you can use Brave(<a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://brave.com/</a>). I use brave on all my devices - laptops and phones as the default browser. It has inbuilt ad and tracker blocking and since it is built on the same open-source framework as Chrome you still get the features you love. Having said this Brave has its minor issues as well so if you can use Firefox with the adblocker plugin. </li>
<li><strong>Avoid smart devices if possible</strong> - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazons-alexa-never-stops-listening-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexa is always listening to you</a>. Always. And she is sending everything that she hears to Amazon servers. Google Home is doing the same. So is Siri. If you can live without them, that’s the best-case scenario. If you don’t want to be left out of the whole smart house times use them wisely. Keep your Alexa and Google homes off at all times and turn on only when you want to use them. That’s what I do with my Amazon Echo. </li>
<li><strong>Use paid/ad-free services wherever possible</strong> - We use a lot of apps and services which use ads as their source of income to offer their service for free. Most of them also have a paid ad-free version which might offer you a little extra functionality as well. I am a big proponent of paying for an app or service if it really adds value to my life. It also supports smaller developers financially without having to rely on shady techniques like ads and data gathering. For me, no ads is the biggest perk. The biggest example for me for this is Youtube. I have been paying for Youtube premium for a very long time. Even though <a href="https://akhil.me/2020/Breaking-out-of-the-Baby-Shark-trap/">I have weaned my daughter off her Youtube habit</a> there was a time when we used to watch youtube for at least a couple of hours every day. I did not want to expose her, or myself as a matter of fact, to any advertising for as long as it was possible so I upgraded to Youtube premium. In the same spirit, there are a bunch of apps that I have paid for even though they would have functioned exactly the same if I had gone for the free version. More on this in a future post.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t install anything you don’t need</strong> - I am not sure if you have noticed but every single business out there is trying to get you to install their app. Everyone from my local grocer to my pediatrician now has an app. And they want that to be on my phone. The reason they are pushing for you to install these apps is so that they can gather more data about you and use the apps to send you targeted notifications. You do not need to install every app just because it prompted you to install it. Even if you have to install an app because the web version was not satisfactory you now have the option of removing immediately after use. Looking at how fast and cheap internet connections we have with us all the time you can now install and remove apps on demand. </li>
<li><strong>Don’t click on random links</strong> - This is just plain common sense. No there are no scandalous photos or videos of your favorite celebrities behind that shady looking link. No one is giving you a BMW worth 1Cr just for clicking a link and sharing a photo. High-quality copies of movies that have not even released cannot be downloaded from torrent sites. Use a little common sense.</li>
<li><strong>Do not connect to random free wifis</strong> - There are no free things in this world. At least not anymore.</li>
<li>Keep your phones, laptops, software, and apps up to date. <br>

</li>

Skip to next section if you find talking about computers and networks boring)"></a>(Good to have. Skip to next section if you find talking about computers and networks boring)</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Use Ad-blocking DNS</strong> - Although my first preference would have been network-wide adblocking using a PiHole (next point) this is still a good option for people who don’t want to mess with hardware and their router. By changing a few, simple settings on your device you can start blocking ads and trackers at a DNS level. Sure your adblocker could already be blocking those but it is limited to the browser only. It cannot block ads and trackers embedded in the apps and games that you have installed on your phone. Blocking trackers using a privacy-centric DNS takes care of that. The setup process is fairly easy and you should be running in a couple on minutes. I personally recommend Adguard DNS (<a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html</a>). I have tried in the past and considering that the configuration is easy and no hardware or servers are needed it is a good way to start. I recommend that you configure your router to use Adguard as the upstream DNS (all instructions are present in the link shared) so that you don’t have to make changes in each device individually. Else you always have the option of setting it up on the …</p></li></ol></section></article></div></div></div></div>

<article>
    <p>This is the 2nd post in a series on how Swift’s calling conventions work on ARM64. If you have not read <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/">my first post on Swift’s calling conventions</a> for <code>Int</code> and <code>Bool</code> types, please read that first.</p>
<p>To try out the examples in this article, please make sure you have done the following set up first:</p>

<p>Item #3 is very important. If you set a breakpoint in Xcode’s UI the following steps may not work.</p>
<h2 id="the-code-we-will-investigate">The Code We Will Investigate</h2>
<p>In this post we will investigate the calling conventions used in the following code. In the <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#the-project-we-will-use">iOS app project you created</a>, replace the contents of <code>ViewController.swift</code> with the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>UIKit</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Before continuing, make sure you can build and run the project.</p>
<h2 id="background-information">Background Information</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0055/c/">“Procedure Call Standard for the ARM 64-bit Architecture”</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The base standard provides for passing arguments in general-purpose registers (<code>r0</code>-<code>r7</code>), SIMD/floating-point registers (<code>v0</code>-<code>v7</code>) and on the stack. For subroutines that take a small number of small parameters, only registers are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically the document does say that floating-point arguments will be stored in registers <code>v0</code>-<code>v7</code>, but its actually a little more complicated than that. Each <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> register holds 128bits, and there are different registers which reference different chunks of this memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/a/advanced-simd-and-floating-point-programming/extension-register-bank-mapping-in-aarch64-state">These docs</a> explain how these other registers work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mapping between the registers is as follows: <br>
<code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> <br>
<code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> <br>
<code>h&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> <br>
<code>b&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>h&lt;n&gt;</code> <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the register <code>d0</code> maps to the least significant 64 bits of <code>v0</code>. Similarly <code>s0</code> maps to the least significant 32 bits of <code>d0</code> (transitively, <code>s0</code> also maps the least significant 32 bits of <code>v0</code>).</p>
<p>Since <code>Float</code>s only need 32 bits, Swift will store them in <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> registers. Similarly Swift will use <code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> registers to store <code>Doubles</code> since they need 64 bits.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, we should expect that <code>Float</code> arguments will be stored in registers <code>s0</code>-<code>s7</code>. Let’s try it out.</p>
<h2 id="float">Float</h2>
<h3 id="argument-values">Argument Values</h3>
<p>Use the approach <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#placing-breakpoints-on-swift-functions">described here</a> to place a breakpoint on <code>testFloat</code>, and run the project until the breakpoint triggers. Then run the following commands in LLDB:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read s0 s1 -f f
      s0 = 100.111
      s1 = 100.222
</code></pre></div><p>This confirms our hypothesis! We can find <code>Float</code> arguments in the <code>s0</code>-<code>s7</code> registers.</p>
<p>We can also confirm the relationship between <code>s0</code>, <code>d0</code>, and <code>v0</code> below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read s0 -f h
      s0 = 0x42c838d5
(lldb) register read d0 -f h
      d0 = 0x0000000042c838d5
(lldb) register read v0 -f h
      v0 = 0x00000000000000000000000042c838d5
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how the larger registers contain the same data, just padded.</p>
<h3 id="return-value">Return Value</h3>
<p>Just like we learned in my <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#return-value">previous article</a>, <code>Float</code> return values will be stored the same way that the first <code>Float</code> argument is stored. This means that a <code>Float</code> return value should be stored in <code>s0</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s confirm:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) thread step-out
(lldb) register read s0 -f f
      s0 = 200.333
</code></pre></div><p>Great! This is exactly what we expect. Just to remind you, <code>thread step-out</code> will execute the rest of the current function, pop the call stack, and then pause the debugger. At this point, the return value should be correctly stored in the intended register.</p>
<h2 id="double">Double</h2>
<h3 id="argument-values-1">Argument Values</h3>
<p><code>Double</code> works exactly the same as <code>Float</code> execpt that values are stored in the 64bit <code>d0</code>-<code>d7</code> registers. This means that the arguments to <code>testDouble</code> will be stored in <code>d0</code> and <code>d1</code>.</p>
<p>You can verify this by setting a breakpoint on <code>testDouble</code> and running:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read d0 d1 -f f
      d0 = 200.111
      d1 = 200.222
</code></pre></div><h3 id="return-value-1">Return Value</h3>
<p>The return value works exactly the same as with <code>Float</code>, execpt it uses the <code>d0</code> register.</p>
<p>You can use these commands to try it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) thread step-out 
(lldb) register read d0 -f f
      d0 = 400.333
</code></pre></div><h2 id="mixed-argument-types">Mixed Argument Types</h2>
<p>What happens if a function has mixed argument types?</p>
<p>This works as you would probably expect. <code>Float</code>/<code>Double</code> arguments are stored in the floating point registers, and <code>Int</code>/<code>Bool</code> arguments are stored in the general purpose registers.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out to see what happens:</p>
<h3 id="float-int">Float, Int</h3>
<p>Set a breakpoint on <code>testFloatInt</code> and run the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read s0 s1 -f f
      s0 = 300.111
      s1 = 300.222
(lldb) register read x0 x1 -f d
      x0 = 300333
      x1 = 300444
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how the <code>Int</code> arguments are stored in registers <code>x0</code>, and <code>x1</code> even though they are the 3rd, and 4th arguments respectively. This is because they are the 1st and 2nd <em><code>Int</code></em> arguments.</p>
<p>Also notice how Swift chose to put the floaing point values in the floating point registers <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> even though the general purpose registers <code>x&lt;n&gt;</code> would have had enough space to store these values.</p>
<h3 id="int-float-double-int">Int, Float, Double Int</h3>
<p>Let’s try out a more complex example in which integer and floating point values are interleaved.</p>
<p>Set a breakpoint on <code>testIntFloatDoubleInt</code> and run the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read x0 -f d
      x0 = 400111
(lldb) register read s0 -f f
      s0 = 400.222
(lldb) register read d1 -f f
      d1 = 400.333
(lldb) register read x1 -f d
      x1 = 400444
</code></pre></div><p>Again, Swift puts the 1st and 2nd <code>Int</code> values in <code>x0</code> and <code>x1</code> respectively.</p>
<p>Also notice how the first floating point value is in <code>s0</code>, but the 2nd one is in <code>d1</code>. This is beacause the <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code>, and <code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> registers actually just represent a smaller section of a <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> register. Once Swift uses <code>s0</code> for one argument it means that <code>d0</code>, and <code>v0</code> are used up too. It must store the next floaing point argument in <code>s1</code> / <code>d1</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I hope this article helped explain how Swift stores its floating point arguments on ARM64! If you’ve read <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/">my first article</a> too you should now understand how Swift stores <code>Int</code>, <code>Bool</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Double</code> types as arguments and return values.</p>
<p><code>Int</code> and <code>Bool</code> values are stored in the <code>x&lt;n&gt;</code> registers, and floaing point values are stored in the <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> registers (or the smaller variants if possible).</p>
<p>In my next article I’m planning to cover how Swift stores <code>Strings</code> on ARM64.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you use <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#placing-breakpoints-on-swift-functions">the approach desribed here</a> to set breakpoints. Setting breakpoints using the UI or using <code>breakpoint set --name &lt;func_name&gt;</code> may not work because LLDB may not pause the function on the first instruction. If other instructions execute, there’s a chance that the register values may get overwritten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you are running this code on a real iOS device. If you run this code on the iOS simulator, Swift will likely be running on a x86 CPU which has a different calling convention.</p>

  <section>



    <article>
      

      <p>I recently had the opportunity to dive down into <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad">Hashicorp’s Nomad</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. We are looking into replacing a manually provisioned setup that is currently configured by <a href="https://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a>. While Salt already offers us easy deployment and configuration of all our environments from a Salt server, we lack rolling updates, horizontal scaling and an easy way to roll back to an earlier version. We also want to do cool stuff, like deploy all of our features in pull requests for our non-developer teams to review.</p>

<p>Last but not least, being a small team, we would also like to avoid becoming system administrators of a small cluster of linux servers, requiring hardening and maintenance. This made us have a keen eye towards managed services, and becoming truly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing">Cloud Native™</a>.</p>

<p>Our application is already containerized with docker, so picking a container orchestrator to handle deployment is the default move, it is just a matter of which one.</p>



<h2 id="why-not-docker-compose-or-docker-swarm">Why not Docker Compose or Docker Swarm?</h2>
<p>We have built the entire application stack using docker containers, both provided by images readily available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">dockerhub</a> and our own containerized code. This led us to a natural usage of docker-compose to orchestrate our stack when developing. The entire application stack includes rabbitmq, redis, celery and our product based on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> fronted by a gunicorn wsgi.</p>

<p>Docker Compose is great as it allows us to spin up all of our containers and dependent applications in unison. It is simple to configure and we keep our compose file source controlled in the same repository as our code. However, while it is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/">certainly possible to use compose in production</a>, we were hesitant as it doesn’t quite qualify as an orchestrator, lacking replication, load balancing or rolling updates.</p>

<p>The next natural thing to explore would be <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a>. Swarm is native to docker and fulfills almost all of our requirements, aside from being managed by a provider. We did however steer clear off it after discussing potential requirements not involving docker containers.</p>


<p>My team, and especially the CTO, is not afraid of adopting new tech and likes to emphasize the fun-factor of working with software. So while Nomad currently is nowhere to be seen as a service on any of the big cloud providers, it deserved a thorough investigation before being cast aside. Especially considering Hashicorp’s track record of delightful products like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-nomad">Getting to know Nomad</h2>
<p>Nomad offers great terminology, and when learning new software, terminology and to some degree analogy is key. Nomad uses Job, Task Groups and Tasks when defining what should actually be run on the cluster. This is great, as it immediately conveys an inheritance relationship and instills some sort of workflow in the mind of the user.</p>

<p>Example Nomad job file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>job</span><span> </span><span>"example"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>datacenters</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"dc1"</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"service"</span><span>
  </span><span>group</span><span> </span><span>"caching-group"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>task</span><span> </span><span>"redis"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>driver</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"docker"</span><span>
      </span><span>config</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>image</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"redis:3.2"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>task</span><span> </span><span>"rabbitmq"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>driver</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"docker"</span><span>
      </span><span>config</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>image</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"rabbitmq:latest"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After reading some documentation, writing a simple job file, deploying it to your local development cluster, you open up the dashboard. Here, Nomad is a clear winner again. It offers an intuitive and inviting user interface, that quickly explains to you what you have running on your cluster and it’s current state.</p>

<p>Writing a job specification does however feel unpolished, as I was left with having to <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/2811">duplicate environment variables between Tasks</a> if multiple containers needed the same env vars.</p>

<p>Nomad’s container networking is also in need of some love. As with Kubernetes, Nomad offers an extra layer of networking to isolate and communicate between task allocations. However, as Container Network Interfacing just <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-hashicorp-nomad-0-12">made it in this July</a>, it unfortunately ended up scaring me off as being too bleeding edge.</p>


<p>Kubernetes is ubiquitous. It is everywhere, on all the cloud providers as a service. It is hugely popular and with that popularity comes add-ons, modifications and a ton of guides and experiences to lean on. It does however also come with a legacy.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-kubernetes">Getting to know Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Deployments, Jobs, ReplicaSets, ReplicationController, Pods, etc. It just doesn’t explain itself as nicely as terminology in Nomad. It requires the user to painstainkingly read all of the documentation before getting an idea about how they are connected, or not. This is of course only an issue when first learning Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Scowering through the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/">‘Getting Started’</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/">‘Concepts’</a> documentation of Kubernetes however, it also becomes apparent that it is wildly unopionated. This further slows my “time-to-market”, and I am left rather overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Now where Kubernetes shines: it is wildly unopinionated! You can configure and connect your resources (or kubernetes objects depending on the page of documentation you are on) in a multitude of ways. You can control your cluster in a multitude of ways, and you can write your yaml split into multiple files or in one big file if that fits your fancy.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is huge. I think it is described best by the quote on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/what-is-kubernetes">Ubuntu’s website</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Kubernetes ... started as a simple container orchestration tool but has grown into a cloud-native platform. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The deep cloud integration also means that spinning up a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer">Service</a> of type LoadBalancer actually creates a Load Balancer instance on your chosen cloud provider. How wild is that?</p>

<p>In 2020, it is <a href="https://twitter.com/ktheilgaard/status/1304703249610571777">unfair to call Kubernetes a Container Orchestrator</a>, it is simply so much more. It is a standardization of interacting with a cloud provider, and thus must be unopionated to allow for some inversion of control.</p>


<p>Nomad is far from mature and is simply not ready for a customer-facing production workload in my humble opinion. It already has large early adopters, but it appears to be for internal use. Had the networking and task configuration felt complete, as well as perhaps being offered as a managed service, I would probably have preferred working with Nomad, simply due to it being more opionated and thus simpler.</p>

<p>It is great to see the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad">rapid development</a> that Nomad is undergoing, and I look forward to seeing it as a managed service sometime in the future.</p>

<p>For now though, Kubernetes is king.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<div>
			<div><p>Rasa is an open source library for building conversational interfaces, most commonly called “chatbots”. Building a good chatbot is not an easy task and people at Rasa knows it, that’s why their library contains a lot of different components working together.</p>
<p>One of these components is the NLU (Natural Language Understanding) that resulted to be the best choice for a set of projects where I needed to build a model to do Named Entity Recognition. In this post I’d tell you some of the reasons I decided to go with Rasa.</p>
<p>Rasa has been built to create chatbots, so an important concept in this kind of tools is the “intent”. What the NLU tries to do is to distinguish between different “intentions” the user has when her inputs some text.</p>
<p>For example, if the user input is:</p>
<ul>
<li>hi</li>
<li>what’s up?</li>
<li>how you doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>The desired intent can be called “greet”.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to order a burger with fries on the side</li>
<li>I’d like to order an hamburger with fries</li>
<li>I want a burger and some fries too</li>
</ul>
<p>The desired intent can be called “order”.</p>
<p>As you can see, the intents mechanism works like a classification model where the input is the users text and the predicted intent is the output.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The way Rasa is built makes it very easy to add examples to train the NLU. You don’t need to be a programmer nor have technical expertise to help, with a good documentation almost everyone could be capable to contribute(*). This allows a cheaper and faster way to move your project forward.</p>
<p>(*) There are exceptions like adding regular expressions or things from external components.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>The NLU training is made through several files located in the /data folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>intents: within each intent type it’s possible to add several claims, tagging the existing entities within the text.</li>
<li>synonyms: you can define synonyms between different words/tokens in order to normalize them into a single token.</li>
<li>lookup tables: you can add a list of words/tokens for each type of entity you’d like to extract, this kind of lists help improving the performance of the ML CRF model component included in Rasa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see an example:</p>
<p><code>- intent: check_balance<br>
examples: |<br>
- What's my [credit](account) balance?<br>
- What's the balance on my [credit card account]{"entity":"account","value":"credit"}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the code above we can see that for the “check_balance” intent we want to extract the account entity type. The words/tokens “credit” and “credit card account” both refer to the same “account” entity type.</p>
<p><code>- synonym: credit<br>
examples: |<br>
- credit card account<br>
- credit account</code></p>
<p>This way you can clearly tell the NLU to consider “credit card account” and “credit account” as synonyms to “credit”.</p>
<p>Then we can train the nlu with this command:</p>
<p><code>rasa train nlu</code></p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>In order to use this NLU component you need to run the service this way:</p>
<p><code>rasa run --enable-api -m models/CURRENTMODEL.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>Once the service is up and running we can make requests:</p>
<p><code>curl SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT/model/parse -d '{"text": "SENTENCE"}'</code></p>
<p>Beautiful, we don’t need to build a custom API, we already have the service ready to use as it is.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p><code>rasa test nlu --config config.yml --nlu data/ --cross-validation</code></p>
<p>This command takes the “config.yml” file, where you can customize the pipeline with all the components and uses all the training files in the /data folder to evaluate the NLU model and generate the performance results. You don’t need to split the data into training and test sets, that’s done automatically by using the –cross-validation parameter.</p>
<p>The beauty of this is that it automatically generates files with all the metrics (f-score, precision, recall) for each entity type. It’s amazing the amount of time this can save you.</p>
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>Adding components to the pipeline is really simple and transparent. Each component is represented by an independent Python script so you don’t have integration problems.</p>
<p>For example the Duckling component, an open source library developed by Facebook which allows you to extract time, date, number, duration and other features from text is easily integrated to Rasa by adding the following lines to the config.yml file:<code>- name: "DucklingHTTPExtractor"<br>
url: "http://0.0.0.0:8000"<br>
locale: "en_GB"<br>
dimensions: ["time", "amount-of-money", "duration", "ordinal", "number"]</code></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are some of the features that made me decide for Rasa for my last named entity recognition related projects. I encourage you to try it for yourself.</p>

<![CDATA[Should You Care About IPv6 Connectivity for Your Web Server?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content-area">
<figure id="attachment_4836"><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/43b24700a36c52cd86ef021786d6a667/p/uploads/2020/02/c8961522.png" alt="city network illustration" width="1400" height="680" data-crediturl="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/wireless-communication-network-concept-iotinternet-things-1007765257" data-credittext="metamorworks"><figcaption><span><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/wireless-communication-network-concept-iotinternet-things-1007765257">metamorworks</a></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, replacing the outdated IPv4 that still powers the majority of the web, and solving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">IP exhaustion issue</a>. Is it really faster, and should you care about it for your server?</p>
<h2>Is IPv6 Faster?</h2>
<p>There’s a bit of debate surrounding this question. On paper, IPv6 should be marginally slower. <a href="https://www.omnisecu.com/tcpip/ipv6/comparison-between-ipv4-header-and-ipv6-header.php">The header size is much larger</a>, due to IPv6 needing 128 bits for the source and destination addresses compared to IPv4’s 32 bits. Overall, IPv6’s header size is nearly doubled.</p>
<p>This isn’t really an issue in practice though, since&nbsp;IPv6 is not just an increase in address size—it greatly simplifies the handling of traffic, and in some cases can lead to actual performance increases due to bottlenecks in IPv4 infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the past, IPv6 used to be terribly slow, but it’s getting better year by year. According to Facebook in 2015, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/networking-traffic/ipv6-it-s-time-to-get-on-board/">IPv6 improved TCP connect response times by up to 15%</a>. However, this is on the order of a few milliseconds, which isn’t nothing, but isn’t such a radical speed benefit that would require you turn it on immediately.</p>
<p>In some cases though, IPv6 can actually be a bit slower than IPv4, not to mention the fact that some users may not be able to access IPv6 content.</p>
<h2>Verdict: It Doesn’t Hurt to Enable It</h2>
<p>The good news is, we don’t need to settle this debate here, since the question doesn’t actually matter. You don’t have to choose one or the other. Most modern browsers will <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1199141">send out TCP handshake requests to both the IPv4 and IPv6</a> addresses of your web server (as well as any other alternate addresses). Whichever one responds first is chosen to make the full connection.</p>
<p>If an older browser doesn’t support this, it will simply connect to the IPv4 address. This is known as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs">Happy Eyeballs</a>&nbsp;(or Fast Fallback) algorithm, and it’s the major reason that makes IPv6 adoptable in the first place.</p>
<p>Overall, if you can’t enable IPv6 for some reason, or simply don’t care, you won’t be missing out on much. However, enabling it is very simple, and with potential performance improvements on the table, it’s worth taking a few minutes to turn it on. After all, it can’t hurt.</p>

<h2>How To Turn On IPv6 in NGINX and Apache</h2>
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need to make sure your web server is even accessible over IPv6. This will usually involve you requesting an IPv6 address from your VPS provider. For AWS, IPv6 addresses are created automatically for EC2 instances, and are assigned to the ENI—not the instance itself.</p>
<p>After that, you’ll need to create an&nbsp;<strong>AAAA Record</strong> (four times IPv4) in your DNS, so that users will know what address to connect to. Your DNS provider should have an option for this. For AWS, you can even create AAAA Alias records, which will map dynamically to an AWS resource over IPv6.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/4fc49a91d112d63154ba425628de515a/p/uploads/2020/02/51480353.png" alt="dns aaaa record" width="532" height="322"></p>
<p>For NGINX, you can enable IPv6 by listening on your server’s available IPv6 addresses, with the following notation:</p>
<pre>server {
  listen [::]:80;
}</pre>
<p>Optionally, you can listen on a single manual address using <code>listen [ADDRESS]:80</code>, or only enable IPv6 using <code>ipv6only=on</code>.</p>
<p>For Apache, you can turn it on in the same manner using an additional <code>Listen</code> directive in your <code>httpd.conf</code>:</p>
<pre>Listen [ADDRESS]:80</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I admit it: I haven’t taken notes in a while. Back in university I was generally using OneNote and drawing quick illustrations on the touch screen of my Lenovo. But that was a while ago, and I just recently found a reason to take notes again.</p>
<p>I began the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coursera machine learning</a> course and ended up looking into note-taking solutions, trying to figure out which would suit my style and the content of the course best. After bouncing between a few different tools, my final “stack” is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> for taking notes (you can see the notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Notes-fe3bb4e0fab84020a151739f6033e785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Excalidraw</a> for illustrations (I won’t discuss this further, but it is a great way to generate quick and easy graphics for notes without getting caught up on perfectionism — for an example see the graphics on <a href="https://www.notion.so/Linear-Regression-with-One-Variable-c6742a27450f41118b8eb953c99275cf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this page</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a> for running Python code (not actually required for the course, but I do it anyways so I can learn Python as I work through the course — you can view the notebooks <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/liamross/machine-learning-notes/tree/master/notes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose these because they ended up working best for me personally, but they may not be the best fit for everyone. However, I’ll discuss more why I made the choices I did, and you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>First, some requirements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The tool should allow me to take notes easily and quickly</li>
<li>It should have good support for code snippets and math</li>
<li>Notes should look good with minimal intervention</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been an abundance of note-taking apps released recently (or not so recently), and many of them overlap in terms of functionality. I’m going to go through the ones I considered and explain why I ended up choosing Notion.</p>

<p>Now for the options that I immediately ruled out:</p>
<h3 id="onenote"><a href="#onenote" aria-label="onenote permalink"></a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OneNote</a></h3>
<p>Even though it served me well in university, I decided not to use OneNote for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No native code snippet support (although it can be added with a plugin)</li>
<li>I wasn’t really a fan of the infinite canvas approach, I like some more structure</li>
<li>It feels pretty geared towards touch screens, and I’m not drawing my illustrations any more</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evernote"><a href="#evernote" aria-label="evernote permalink"></a><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a></h3>
<p>The old reliable option. Definitely the most well-known out of all the options. Also probably the worst. I almost immediately ruled it out because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No syntax highlighting</li>
<li>No latex support (necessary for a course like machine learning with lots of math)</li>
<li>Limited formatting options (or at least obvious easy-to-use ones from my quick check)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="roam"><a href="#roam" aria-label="roam permalink"></a><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a></h3>
<p>The hyped new note-taking tool / early cult formation. People have been going wild for it on twitter, so I figured I’d look into it. At the end of the day I ruled it out for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It costs money ($165 USD a year for “Professional”, or $500 USD for 5 years if you choose the “Believer” package… Hmmm)</li>
<li>Notes taken with it don’t actually look that good (but that’s just personal preference, they don’t look terrible)</li>
<li>It doesn’t offer me anything that other free options don’t have (or at least anything that I’d find useful for the kind of notes I’m taking)</li>
</ol>

<p>And now the options that actually worked. One common pro for all of these options is they are free, or at least offer a free tier which I fall under.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a><a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a></h3>
<p>I actually started taking notes with Obsidian, since it had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backlinks</a> which I thought would be useful, especially if I wanted to organize my notes by topic rather than by lecture. However, I ended up switching to <a href="#Jupyter">Jupyter</a> in order to be able to have the notes be public, and in order to run Python code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-obsidian"><a href="#pros-of-obsidian" aria-label="pros of obsidian permalink"></a>Pros of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Super easy to link between pages using the <code>[[Some other page]]</code> syntax. Can also use that syntax for images which is nice</li>
<li>Since Obsidian is just a file editor, you own the Markdown files it produces</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-obsidian"><a href="#cons-of-obsidian" aria-label="cons of obsidian permalink"></a>Cons of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Limited by the fact it’s a Markdown editor in terms of formatting and syntax (also no way to format attached images so they aren’t full width)</li>
<li>Since it is a local application that uses a unique syntax for Markdown, you can’t easily share the notes</li>
<li>Even though I’m very proficient with Markdown (this blog is written in it!), it sucks to take bad Markdown-looking notes and have the actual nice notes in a different view</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jupyter"><a href="#jupyter" aria-label="jupyter permalink"></a><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a></h3>
<p>I switched to Jupyter to share the notes publicly and to run Python algorithms in-line. However, it suffered from the same Markdown weaknesses as Obsidian, and was an even worse tool for actual note-taking. I ended up switching to <a href="#Notion">Notion</a>, but continue to use Jupyter for supplementary Python examples related to my notes. All in all this isn’t really Jupyter’s fault, since it was never really designed for heavy-duty multi-notebook note-taking. However in my dreams there will one day be a tool with the features of Notion but with the ability for running in-line code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-jupyter"><a href="#pros-of-jupyter" aria-label="pros of jupyter permalink"></a>Pros of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Being able to run Python code in-line is by far the largest benefit of using Jupyter</li>
<li>You own the files</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-jupyter"><a href="#cons-of-jupyter" aria-label="cons of jupyter permalink"></a>Cons of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Absolutely terrible for linking between files. Have to basically do <code>[Other page](./other_page.ipynd)</code> each time, and obviously that’s even worse if the path isn’t that simple. Jupyter definitely wasn’t made for that kind of note-taking. Same for images</li>
<li>Same cons as Obsidian with relation to being a Markdown editor, although Jupyter has a edit mode for blocks rather than persistent Markdown, so the experience is a bit better. Nonetheless, I still found myself constantly editing then “running” blocks which was slightly inconvenient</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a></h3>
<p>Finally, I ended up trying out Notion and it stuck.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-notion"><a href="#pros-of-notion" aria-label="pros of notion permalink"></a>Pros of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Notes look immediately good, and there are more formatting options </li>
<li>Decent latex support. Slightly worse than Obsidian and Jupyter since it only has Katex support, but still good enough for my use cases so far</li>
<li>They just recently introduced backlinks which I’ve found to be quite nice</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-notion"><a href="#cons-of-notion" aria-label="cons of notion permalink"></a>Cons of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Takes a while to index new pages so linking to them can be slow for the first bit</li>
<li>A con that is specific to moving to Notion from Jupyter is I can no longer run in-line Python. However I still have Jupyter notebooks containing live Python code, and I link to them from the Notion notes so I still get the benefits of Notion and Jupyter</li>
<li>No support for tables that aren’t databases. A bit of a bummer if you just want to make a simple Markdown table to display some information (like a training set which comes up a lot in the machine learning course)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m very happy with Notion so far. It allows me to take notes quickly, and hits all the requirement checkboxes. Additionally, it’s easy to share as a public site for my notes, which is an added benefit. To see the notes click <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Notes-fe3bb4e0fab84020a151739f6033e785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and to visit the repository with code examples and Jupyter notebooks click <a href="https://github.com/liamross/machine-learning-notes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

Sometimes. But not always. Consider the following snippet of code:</p><div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>I intentionally do not define <code>g</code> in this translation unit since otherwise, the compiler will be too smart and inline everything.
Nevertheless, all the major C++ compilers can figure out that <code>f</code> only contains a tail-call to <code>g</code> and generate codes like this:</p><p>Now lets consider the following code:</p><div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>noexcept</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Since the compilers have no idea if <code>g</code> would throw or not, they are forced to generate codes that invoke <code>std::terminate</code> in case bad things happened.
Here is the result codegen from various compilers:</p><p>msvc</p><div data-language="nasm"><pre><code><span>$</span>ip2state<span>$</span>int f(void) DB <span>02H</span>

        call    __cxa_begin_catch
        call    std::terminate()</code></pre></div><h2>How to deal with C functions?</h2><p>Now we know that <code>noexcept</code> can cause overhead if we call a non-noexcept function inside, how do we deal with functions that will not throw but are not mark as <code>noexcept</code>? Fortunately, the venerable <a href="https://twitter.com/hankadusikova?s=20">Hana Dusíková</a> came up with a clever solution:</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Did you ever get an suboptimal code, because you were calling external C function in your noexcept code?</p><p>Suffer no more:<a href="https://t.co/LA7C76a063">https://t.co/LA7C76a063</a></p></div>— Hana Dusíková 🍊 (@hankadusikova) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankadusikova/status/1276828584179642368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2020</a></blockquote><p>You can mark the <code>noexcept_cast</code> function force inline by compiler-specific extensions so it will not decrease performance in debug mode.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Don't spam <code>noexcept</code> if you don't have a project-wise "no exception" policy. And be especially careful with higher-order functions that may invoke user-defined functions. All in all, <code>noexcept</code> is a part of the type system and the contract of your API. Only add <code>noexcept</code> to function that you want to guarantee not to throw.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>All data and engineering teams are faced with a constant inflow of organizational, technical, and interpersonal problems and the ability of your team to have business impact will depend largely on how effectively it can move towards optimal solutions to those problems.&nbsp; In this article, I discuss<em> four communication techniques</em> that improve the ability of a team to solve problems.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://documents.app.lucidchart.com/documents/4a162d92-9c91-4478-91b4-b893591b316f/pages/0_0?a=624&amp;x=109&amp;y=38&amp;w=844&amp;h=253&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2015c6c000cf3d2ca79ca0f2238c9ccfd56666e1b7-ts%3D1600622689" alt="" width="553" height="164"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Work from the problem to the solution:&nbsp; move in the right direction.</em></strong></p>



<p>When presented with a problem, first spend time elucidating the problem space before addressing potential solutions.&nbsp; Interestingly, I think the intuitive and most common approach is to do the opposite: present and advocate for your solution. &nbsp; I think the reason for this is that people tend to assume that others understand the problem as clearly as you do, that you have a full understanding of the problem, and that you understand which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve for the business.&nbsp; Thus, the only thing that is interesting is the solution you came up with – a solution that is either clever or based on your notable experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem though is that these assumptions are usually wrong.&nbsp; Typically if you spend time first fleshing out the problem, you will realize that other people on the team have context on the problem that you don’t have.&nbsp; Or that they do not share an understanding of what the problem is or that there is disagreement about what aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve first.&nbsp; Often you will realize that people are focused on solving the technical problem but that they do not have a good understanding of the <em>business </em>problem.&nbsp; It is critical that the business problem is clearly fleshed out before addressing the technical problem.</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Spend time talking about the problem before anyone presents solutions.&nbsp; It will make sure everyone has the same context.&nbsp; It ensures that the business problem is the focus and that people will agree – <em>before presenting their solution ideas</em> – which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve. This process helps remove ego from the conversation, which can develop when a group of smart highly experienced present different solutions that incidentally emphasize different aspects of the problem.&nbsp; Time spent on the problem space consistently will help you identify better solutions, more efficiently, and with less drama.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://documents.app.lucidchart.com/documents/4a162d92-9c91-4478-91b4-b893591b316f/pages/0_0?a=624&amp;x=121&amp;y=330&amp;w=853&amp;h=272&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2025c83fef8709e6b41929b2f07e7877b84a6ba280-ts%3D1600622689" alt="" width="576" height="183"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Split-tracking – prevent circular and chaotic conversations.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I have seen a number of conversations about thorny problems go in circles and not only fail to identify good solutions but even make little progress towards a shared understanding of the problem space.&nbsp; How do you prevent this from happening?&nbsp; The primary thing to do is to keep your conversation organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to do so is to use a technique called <em>split-tracking</em>.&nbsp; Split-tracking is a technique, in which you identify that more than one issue or concern has been raised, bring group awareness to this observation, generate consensus that there is more than one issue at play, and then push others to focus on one issue at a time. &nbsp; Why does this help? &nbsp; People often don’t realize that they are conflating two issues so they don’t realize when they are jumping back and forth between these issues.&nbsp; If these issues are not explicitly identified and separated, it can be hard to probe and press a person’s thinking on an issue – they can unconsciously side-step into the second issue. If there are multiple people discussing a problem, it is possible for people to start going in circles if different people re-direct the group to a secondary issue and then another person brings it back to the first issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Be on the lookout for multiple underlying issues and concerns.&nbsp; If you see them, stop the conversation and say,  “I am hearing two issues here.&nbsp; One is issue $X and other is issues $Y.&nbsp; Which one should we focus on first?” &nbsp; Make sure other people realize that there are separate issues – even if they are correlated – and get them to agree to work on them separately.&nbsp; In general, think like a scientist – care about the taxonomy of your problem and neatly classify all the sub-problems that exist and their relation to each other (i.e., this is a subproblem of this bigger problem).&nbsp; You can work towards a solution much more effectively, if the problem space is well organized and explicitly understood by everyone in the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Empathy – prevent friction and “land mines” from stopping forward progress.</em></strong></p>



<p>Have you ever been in a meeting discussing a problem, making some progress, and then just suddenly had all forward progress come screeching to a halt? &nbsp; Usually this happens when people become defensive or if the conversation triggered an emotional response in someone.&nbsp; How do we prevent this from happening?&nbsp; Although each individual needs to work to keep the bigger picture in mind and to keep their ego out of the conversation, you cannot control other people’s reactions.&nbsp; So what can you do?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Work on being more empathetic in your communication.&nbsp; Carefully consider how others view the problem and how some aspects of the problem may impact them and their work more than you.&nbsp; Consider that even if they have less relevant experience than you, that they still want their viewpoints to be considered and valued.&nbsp; In general, approach people and their thoughts with curiosity.&nbsp; Try to clarify your understanding of their perspective and make it clear that you are spending time trying to understand their views.</p>



<p>If you do this, you will be less likely to trigger an emotional response that will put a lot of friction between you and your solution.&nbsp; You will make people feel heard even if the solution that is ultimately arrived at doesn’t solve their main pain points. When you approach problems empathetically, it is also easier to build consensus and excitement in the group, which is critical. Identifying the solution is not the final step – implementing the solution is, and you want a motivated team to tackle that step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emphasizing empathy when working with others has a few other advantages.&nbsp; One, because empathy is driven by curiosity about someone’s perspective, it makes it easier to identify genuine issues that you hadn’t been considering previously, thereby enriching your understanding of the problem.&nbsp; Two, it will help you identify nuances in the concerns of others, providing opportunities for split-tracking and organization of the conversation.&nbsp; Three, empathetic communication enhances psychological safety of the group, which in turn means that all people will feel comfortable voicing their concerns and insights. A group that can communicate openly will be better at fleshing out the full problem space and thereby will be better at identifying the optimal solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, I would like to note although people inherently vary in how empathetic they are, it is also a skill that can be cultivated. &nbsp; So make it a mindset that you work actively to engage in.&nbsp; Cultivate your curiosity. If you struggle with it, try meditation. Its core teaching is the power of developing an open loving curiosity about the world.&nbsp; I’ve spent a week in silent meditation, and I can tell you that if you can find the in and out flow of your breath to be fascinating, then it becomes easy to be intrigued by the perspective of your peers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring – keep the conversation on track</strong></p>



<p>The part of the brain involved in understanding and solving a problem, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is distinct from the part of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex, that is involved in monitoring your environment and behavior for errors that signal a course correction is needed.&nbsp; I have noticed that leaders, who are great at moving a team towards optimal solutions, are able to keep this monitoring brain area highly activated even as they also help the team move towards a solution.&nbsp; They tend to be constantly scanning the conversation at a meta-level looking for issues that will derail it.&nbsp; So what type of issues are they monitoring for?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Establish what you are monitoring for and set the conditions.&nbsp; </em>To know what to monitor for, you first need to clearly identify, at the start of a meeting, what your agenda is and what the basic problem(s) is that you will address.&nbsp; Once there is consensus here, it will be clearer to you if the conversation has moved off track and what you should be monitoring for.&nbsp; Moreover, it also ensures that you have needed conditions for keeping the conversation on track.&nbsp; For example, given your agenda, you should evaluate whether you even have the right decision makers in the room.&nbsp; Do you have unnecessary people who can push the conversation into tangents or are you lacking the needed people so that even if you make a decision, you may not be able to act upon that decision?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation below the right level?&nbsp; </em>Is someone “going into the weeds” by diving into a technical explanation that isn’t needed right now? &nbsp; Monitor for this and pull the group out quickly. &nbsp; At best, it is just a waste of time.&nbsp; At worst, it will derail the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation above the right level?&nbsp; </em>Similarly, thoughts can steer the conversation to a level above the agenda.&nbsp; For example, if your company recently switched to a pods organization and there is some question about how to best handle ownership of one line of work in this new pod structure, it can be easy for the conversation to suddenly be about the pods themselves – whether they are good and how to change and improve the pods.&nbsp; This level of conversation would be above the one set in your agenda, is not one that you want to or are capable of addressing in your current meeting, and if you even were interested in addressing it, you probably don’t have the right people in the room to do so.&nbsp; Pull …</p></div></article></div>

<article>
  <p>Nearly a century ago, Alonzo Church invented the simple, elegant, and yet elusive lambda calculus. Along with Alan Turing, he then proved the Church-Turing thesis: that anything computable with a Turing machine can also be computed in the lambda calculus. However, nearly as soon as we had digital computers, we started inventing programming languages, and with them a vast treasure of features, beautiful and terrible, many of which seem very hard to relate to the fundamental nature of computability, let alone the lambda calculus specifically.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While it’s true that anything which can be computed, period, can be computed in the lambda calculus, you might not want to: it’s austere, to say the least, and was not designed with modern sensibilities regarding readability in mind. We developed all those languages and features for a reason! Still, Church demonstrated not just that it was possible to compute anything computable with the lambda calculus, but also <em>how</em> one might do so.</p>
<p>In this series, we’ll examine some ways to express common programming language features using the minimalistic tools of the lambda calculus. We begin with perhaps the most ubiquitous type: booleans.</p>
<h2 id="λ-is-blind">λ is blind</h2>
<p>The lambda calculus’s austerity is extreme: you don’t even have booleans. All you have are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lambda abstractions;</p></li>
<li><p>Applications; and</p></li>
<li><p>Variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll now review these in some detail; feel free to skip this section if you’re already familiar with the lambda calculus.</p>
<h3 id="lambda-abstractions">Lambda abstractions</h3>
<p>Lambda abstractions (“lambdas,” “abstractions,” and “functions” will also be used interchangeably) introduce a function of a single variable.</p>
<p>Abstractions are written <code>λ x . y</code>, for variable <code>x</code> and expression <code>y</code>, where <code>x</code> is now available as a bound variable in the body, and any enclosing definition of <code>x</code> is shadowed (i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ x . x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . y</code> ≠ <code>λ x . λ y . x</code>). (We shall assume strictly lexical scoping for the time being.)</p>
<p>In Haskell, we would write <code>\ x -&gt; y</code> instead; in JavaScript, <code>function (x) { return y }</code> or <code>(x) =&gt; y</code>.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Applications (“function application” and “function call” will be used interchangeably) apply the result of the expression on the left to the expression on the right.</p>
<p>Applications are written as <code>x y</code>, for expressions x and y, and left-associated, i.e.&nbsp;<code>a b c</code> = <code>(a b) c</code> ≠ <code>a (b c)</code>. Function application binds tighter than lambda abstraction, i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ y . y x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . (y x)</code> ≠ <code>λ x . (λ y . y) x</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is the same in Haskell; in JavaScript, we would write <code>x(y)</code> or <code>a(b, c)</code>. Note however that since lambda calculus functions are all single-argument functions, a more direct (though less idiomatic) equivalent for the latter would be <code>a(b)(c)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Variables introduced by enclosing lambdas.</p>
<p>Variable are written as more or less arbitrary names, typically alphanumeric (e.g.&nbsp;<code>x</code> or <code>y0</code> or <code>thing</code>); however, we will feel free to include non-alphanumeric characters in names as we see fit, since the paucity of syntax means there’s little risk of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Since the only available variables are those bound by enclosing lambdas, we can also infer that there are no <code>let</code> bindings for local variables, and no globals of any sort; the lambda calculus doesn’t come with a standard library.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In quasi-BNF, the grammar for the lambda calculus is extremely minimal:</p>
<figure>
<p><em>e</em> <strong>:=</strong> <code>λ</code> <em>x</em> <code>.</code> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>e</em> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>x</em> <strong>|</strong> (<em>e</em>)</p>
</figure>
<p>And finally, this table gives a side-by-side comparison of the syntax of the lambda calculus with the corresponding syntax in Haskell &amp; JavaScript:</p>

<p>Lambdas are the only way to introduce values—they’re the only “literal” syntax in the language. We can therefore infer that the only kinds of runtime values must be closures. In an interpreter for the lambda calculus, closures might consist of the name of the introduced variable, the body of the lambda, &amp; a map relating the names and values of any variables it closed over when constructed (again, we assume strict lexical scoping). There are no bits, bytes, words, pointers, or objects in the language’s semantics; only this runtime representation of lambdas.</p>
<p>Likewise, lambdas are also the only way to introduce variables—there’s no standard library, built-ins, primitives, prelude, or global environment to provide common definitions. We’re truly baking the apple pie from scratch.</p>
<p>All of this raises the question: how do you <em>do</em> anything when you don’t even have <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>? Lambdas and variables don’t <em>do</em>, they merely <em>are</em>, so that leaves application. When all you have is application, everything looks like a lambda abstraction, so we’ll represent booleans using lambdas.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not <em>just</em> booleans we’re after; <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> aren’t much use without <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>if</code>, and all the rest. To be useful, our representation of booleans should therefore suffice to define these, as well. But how do you define <code>if</code> without using <code>if</code>? In a lazy language like Haskell, we might define <code>if</code> as a function something like so:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>if_ ::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">if_ cond then_ else_ <span>=</span> <span>if</span> cond <span>then</span> then_ <span>else</span> else_</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a strict language like JavaScript, we’d instead take functions for the alternatives:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>function</span> <span>if_</span>(cond<span>,</span> then_<span>,</span> else_) {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  <span>if</span> (cond) {</span>
<span id="cb2-3">    <span>then_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb2-5">    <span>else_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">  }</span>
<span id="cb2-7">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Both these definitions use the language’s native booleans and <code>if</code> syntax (a tactic for implementing embedded DSLs known as “meta-circularity”), and thus aren’t viable in the lambda calculus. However, they do give us a hint: in both cases we have a function taking a condition, consequence, and alternative, and using the first to select one of the latter two. In the lambda calculus, we might start by writing:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . ?</code></pre>
<p>(Note: there aren’t any keywords in the lambda calculus, so there’s nothing stopping me from naming variables things like <code>if</code>, a fact which I will take free advantage of.)</p>
<p>We’ve introduced a definition for <code>if</code>, as a function of three parameters; now what do we do with them? The lambda calculus’s stark palette makes it easy to enumerate <em>all</em> the things we can do with some variable <code>a</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ignore it, whether by simply not mentioning it at all (as in <code>λ a . λ b . b</code>), or by shadowing it with another lambda which binds the same name (as in <code>λ a . λ a . a</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Mention it, whether on its own in the body of a lambda (as in <code>λ a . a</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . a</code>), somewhere within either side of an application (as in <code>λ a . λ b . a b</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . b a</code>), or some combination of both (as in <code>λ a . (λ b . a) a</code>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We could for example simply return <code>then</code> or <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . then
if = λ cond then else . else</code></pre>
<p>But in that case the conditional isn’t conditional at all—the value in no way depends on <code>cond</code>. Clearly the body must make use of all three variables if we want it to behave like the <code>if</code>s we know and love from other languages.</p>
<p>Taking a step back for a moment, let’s examine the roles of <code>if</code>’s arguments. <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> are passive; we only want to use or evaluate one or the other depending on the value of <code>cond</code>. <code>cond</code>, then, is the key: it takes the active role.</p>
<p>Thus, in the same way that our <code>if_</code> functions in Haskell &amp; JavaScript employed those language’s features to implement, we’re going to define <code>if cond then else</code> as the application of the condition to the other two parameters:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . cond then else</code></pre>

<p>This feels strangely like cheating: surely we’ve only moved the problem around. Now instead of <code>if</code> making the decision about which argument to return, we’ve deferred it to <code>cond</code>. But <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code> aren’t the same, semantically; <code>if</code> takes a boolean and two other arguments and returns one of the latter, while <code>cond</code> <em>is</em> a boolean—albeit evidently a boolean represented as a function. Let’s make that precise by writing down <code>if</code>’s type:</p>
<pre><code>if : Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Notwithstanding our use of the yet-to-be-defined name <code>Bool</code> for the type of the condition, this is the same type as we gave <code>if_</code> in Haskell; that’s a good sign that we’re on the right track! It takes a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments of type <code>a</code>, and it must return one of those because that’s the only way for it to come up with the <code>a</code> that it returns. But what <em>is</em> <code>Bool</code>?</p>
<p>Working backwards from the type and definition of <code>if</code>, we see that <code>cond</code> is applied to two arguments, and therefore must be a function of two parameters. Further, these are both of type <code>a</code>, and the value it returns must also be of type <code>a</code> for <code>if</code>’s type to hold. Thus, we can define the type <code>Bool</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>Bool = ∀ a . a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>

<p>If a given <code>Bool</code> is a function of two arguments of arbitrary type, returning the same type, it must therefore select one of its arguments to return. There are only two distinguishable inhabitants of <code>Bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, so we can therefore deduce that since <code>if</code> defers the selection of the result to the <code>Bool</code>, for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to actually differ they must make opposite selections. In other words, <code>true</code> must return the <code>then</code> parameter, while <code>false</code> must return the <code>else</code> one:</p>
<pre><code>true, false : Bool
true  = λ then else . then
false = λ then else . else</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t move the problem around after all; we solved it. What we noticed was a deeper insight: this encoding of booleans makes <code>if</code> redundant, since if we can apply <code>if</code> to a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments, we could equally apply the <code>Bool</code> to those arguments directly.</p>

<p>It’s frequently convenient to conflate booleans with bits, their minimal representation, but in truth they’re not the same at all. Practically, some programming languages define booleans as a byte in memory, perhaps clamping its values to 0 and 1; others define them as instances of some boolean class, or constructors of an algebraic datatype. Some provide no formal relationship between <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> at all, save for a common interface—duck typing.</p>
<p>Mathematically, booleans are the values in propositional logic; the upper and lower bounds of a lattice; the zero and one of a semiring; the members of the set with cardinality 2; …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Pikchr (pronounced "picture") is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_language">PIC</a>-like markup
language for diagrams in technical documentation.  Pikchr is
designed to be embedded in <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced code blocks</a> of
Markdown or similar mechanisms of other documentation markup languages.</p>

<p>For example, the diagram:</p>

<p>Pikchr diagrams can appear in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Wiki pages</li>
<li>Tickets and bug reports</li>
<li>Forum posts</li>
<li>Check-in comments</li>
<li>Anywhere else that Markdown or similar markup languages are used</li>
</ul>

<p>Pikchr diagrams are easy to generate.  The language is simple.
There is lots of documentation and examples on-line (links below).
Anyone who is comfortable using Markdown should be able to pick up Pikchr
with minimal extra effort.</p>

<p>Pikchr is safe for use in internet-facing applications.  Hostile
Pikchr scripts cause no harm (apart from generating ugly diagrams).</p>

<h2>Demos</h2>

<li><a href="https://pikchr.org/home/pikchrshow">/pikchrshow</a> ← Enter Pikchr text and see the result on-line</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Is A Work In Progress</h2>
<p>As of 2020-09-16, the Pikchr code is stable and is in active use.
However, documentation is still under development.
We are using Pikchr to write the Pikchr documentation (in Markdown),
hence it was necessary to deploy Pikchr into a working content
management system (<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil">Fossil</a> in this case) prior to having
complete documentation available.  Volunteer assistance is welcomed!</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">


  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first line of a PyTorch training loop normally looks like this:</p>

<p><code>text, hypothesis, judgement = current_batch</code></p>

<p>Or it might look like this 🤔:</p>

<p><code>hypothesis, text, judgement = current_batch</code></p>

<p>It’s easy to forget the correct order and I prefer to make the components of my minibatch explicit.</p>

<p><code>current_batch.hypothesis</code></p>

<p>This blog post is going to demonstrate how to use <code>NamedTuples</code> to allow the above access.</p>

<p>We will implement a custom <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> and will pass it to the <code>data.DataLoader</code>.</p>

<p>Our <code>InferenceDataset</code> is just a wrapper over <code>pandas.DataFrame</code> that returns <code>namedtuples</code> :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>InferenceDataset</span><span>(</span><span>Dataset</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>df</span><span>:</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__len__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>df</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__getitem__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>key</span><span>):</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>is</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>f"Non-intiger key (</span><span>{</span><span>key</span><span>}</span><span>)"</span>
        <span>current_row</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>iloc</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span>

        <span>InfRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>namedtuple</span><span>(</span><span>"InfRow"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>"text"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hypothesis"</span><span>,</span> <span>"judgement"</span><span>))</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>InfRow</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>=</span><span>current_row</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>,</span>
                      <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>current_row</span><span>.</span><span>hypothesis</span><span>,</span>
                      <span>judgement</span><span>=</span><span>current_row</span><span>.</span><span>judgement</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re not familiar with <code>namedtuple</code>s, returning an instance of <code>InfRow</code> might seem confusing, however, it just acts like a regular tuple with the added benefit of named access to fields.</p>

<p>Consequently, the vanilla tuple operations work:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>row</span> <span>=</span> <span>InfRow</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>=</span><span>"I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."</span><span>,</span>
	     <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>"I've believed in three impossible things before breakfast."</span><span>,</span>
	     <span>judgement</span><span>=</span><span>"implication"</span><span>)</span>

<span># integer indexation is the same as for vanilla tuples
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>I</span><span>'ve believed in three impossible things before breakfast

# and so is unpacking
text, hypothesis, judgement = row
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above is great news for backwards compatability, ensuring that you can modify and test your <code>DataLoaders</code> one at a time, while keeping the old code for training and inference.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard access methods, <code>namedtuples</code> provide the named fields, that we’re after:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># cont. from above
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>.</span><span>hypothesis</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>I</span><span>'ve believed in three impossible things before breakfast
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We construct the <code>InferenceDataset</code> by loading our dataset files into a <code>DataFrame</code> and passing the <code>DataFrame</code> to the <code>InferenceDataset</code> constructor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>train_df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>dataset_path</span><span>)</span>
<span>train_dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>InferenceDataset</span><span>(</span><span>train_df</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then pass it to the <code>DataLoader</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>train_dataloader</span> <span>=</span> <span>DataLoader</span><span>(</span>
        <span>train_dataset</span><span>,</span>
        <span>sampler</span><span>=</span><span>RandomSampler</span><span>(</span><span>train_dataset</span><span>),</span>
        <span>batch_size</span><span>=</span><span>batch_size</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And within normal iteration, we can access the minibatch fields by names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>batch</span> <span>in</span> <span>train_dataloader</span><span>:</span>
    <span>prediction</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>(</span><span>batch</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>batch</span><span>.</span><span>hypothesis</span><span>)</span>
    <span>....</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Printers are cool because they are, but I have friends that remind me at least weekly that hacking a printer is not useful. Every time it’s mostly the same thing all over again, find a 1990 type bug, write a stupid script, done.
Some months ago, I started a new project, a wild ride inside Google’s humongous codebase. While most of Google code, especially Android, is open source, some parts are not.
I’ll try to talk about one such case, the bootloader of a Pixel 3 phone.</p>

<p>What you are about to read mostly applies to Android 10 and later versions. Much has changed, but the exciting part for us is that now fastboot can run in userspace mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/fastbootd">Here</a> you can find the nitty-gritty details, the TL;DR is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recovery and Fastboot partitions are now the same thing. One less partition, more code reuse. Nice.</li>
<li>The mechanisms to start Recovery or Fastboot is now slightly different, but this is taken care of by the bootloader.</li>
<li>Userspace Fastboot can’t issue some types of commands, namely OEM.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because Userspace fastboot can’t issue OEM commands, we will have to dig into the bootloader code.</p>

<p>Ok, we got a binary, let’s see what’s inside.</p>

</code></pre><p>As soon as I saw that, I started wondering when phones started using UEFI. UEFI and EDK2 are cool, but when did they end up being used in phones?</p>
<p><a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/qcomxbl/">Here</a> there are some notes on the history of why QC uses UEFI. If I understand it correctly, it’s because they want to support Windows on ARM.</p>
<p>Now that we know it’s UEFI, and we satisfied our curiosity on why it’s UEFI, we can start working on it.</p>

<p>Binwalk on the bootloader image will yield precisely zero. UEFI images are very structured, support compression, and allow for nested volumes. Ether, you know what you are looking at, or you are not going to get far.</p>
<p>Get uefi-firmware-parser from pip with</p>
<p><code>python -m pip install --user uefi-firmware-parser</code></p>
<p>uefi-firmware-parser it’s more of a framework and can be used in scripts. Fortunately, they provide a super nice and handy wrapper. The script can brute force <code>-b</code> any unknown image type, searching for known UEFI magic numbers.</p>

            <p>Mr. Jobs had a fascinating desire to make the internals of his Macintosh computer as aesthetically pleasing as the outside. There is something uniquely meaningful to us about this aim that at first thought one cannot describe. The affect of his aim lies in something we call "artisanship". That is: a perception of additional value that is orthogonal to the perceivable value that could have otherwise have been excavated if the producer had chosen to invest time in it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.robsdomain.com/content/images/2020/05/Artboard-1.jpg"></figure><p>Perhaps because we realize time is finite and intrinsically meaningful we perceive the time invested into the intrinsic beauty of the totality of the object as aesthetic and are more willing to ascribe it a higher value. </p><p>Software is different from hardware in that a physical product is, in a way, an authoritative truth: it is materially in front of you as a "thing" that isn't easily transformed into something else. Software, on the other hand, &nbsp;suffers (and benefits) from the attribute of being an "iterable truth". It has little to no material cost besides time and due to its non-material anchoring is infinitely malleable. Unlike a physical good, software does not trigger the instinctive quality heuristic to "measure twice cut once". An incorrect cut may be metaphorically "undone" by throwing away the wood because the wood costs little to nothing. There is no penalty for the failure to prepare and measure it seems.</p><p>In the continued search for universal principles of application I often wonder whether the artisanal dimension of a product is applicable to the digital world. While that would be my hope – as there is little more satisfying than the comfort of a universal principle to justify your stubborn investment in perfection – evidence continues to suggest the contrary. </p><p>Perhaps the phenomenon of artisanal beauty is unique only to products that exist in material domains; however, at times I wonder if the contemporary technology myth of "moving quickly and allowing things to break" has become too saturated in the collective compass to see other approaches. Does real world artisanal software exist? Would the end customer even care?</p><p>Maybe artisanal software is produced for the joy in craft of the creator rather than the consumer. Comically a lot like life in a way.</p><hr><p>Kind thanks to <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/statue-inside-room-2661943/">Alex Y</a> of Pexels for the cover image</p>

      <p>A few days ago I re-published on the Chrome Web Store a small browser extension "HackerNews No Pressure". You can find the store listing <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackernews-no-pressure/bonmddkjpellaijbbpejnboedneopbgp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>It's purpose is to hide user scores, comment scores, and link scores when browsing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>. The implementation is ridiculously simple, it doesn't have any logic, and only consists in a small stylesheet that hides a few elements. It doesn't have any impact other than this and is fairly stable, I'm using it as a side-loaded extension since around 5 years now with zero maintenance.</p>
<p>Someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24455242">asked about that feature</a> in a recent thread, so I felt that would be nice to make it available again to more people.</p>
<p>And that's how HN looks when enabled.</p>

  <p>Plastic is really bad for the environment. It takes 450 to 1000 years to degrade[1]. It affects marine life and litters our streets. Only around 9% of plastic is being recycled every year in the US. We are in Chicago. Everywhere we look, there's a piece of plastic stuck somewhere. We started an experiment to go plastic free grocery shopping for 1 month. These are our findings.</p>

<h4>1 - Our cost of food has gone down 70%.</h4>

<p>We are surprised. We thought we would have to pay more for our grocery. Here is a comparison of food prices with and without plastic packaging. The prices are from 5 popular grocery stores in Chicago.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtvIGXgAEs5cY?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) </p>

<p>Interesting, right?</p>

<p>Another reason behind this result is that plastic wrap food usually comes in bulk. We end up buying more food than we need. Buying food per pound helps us think about how much we will eat. For a family of 2, we usually buy about 1-2 pounds of each produce. Here are the price differences.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtUosXsAU8LjX?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Food prices per pound vs per package in Chicago. September 2020 Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Food prices per pound vs per package (September 2020, Chicago)</p>

<p>We save so much if we go for zero packaging food. After all, people are paying a premium for the plastic package without thinking. We also don't waste as much of food. It's win-win!</p>

<h4>2 - We eat healthier</h4>

<p>We can't order food delivery anymore. It used to be a big chunk of our monthly bill. Most of the time we cook at home. We make homemade french fries instead of buying chips. It tastes better! We bring our own containers to restaurants when we order takeout.</p>

<h4>3 - Opt out a lot of options for shopping</h4>

<p>I don't know if it's only us feeling this way, but a lot of products have too many options.<br>
Opting out of plastic leaves only a handful of brands. Saves a ton of time for shopping.</p>

<h4>4 - We create a lot less trash</h4>

<p>Less packaging. Less trash.</p>

<p>Here are the cons.</p>

<h4>1 - It was difficult to find meat and bread that don't use plastic or styrofoam.</h4>

<p>Only 1-2 stores of the 5 have paper packaging for meat. For bread, we have to look for a local bakery for zero plastic options.</p>

<h4>2 - Food delivery is no longer an option.</h4>

<p>I put it as a pro and con in this section. Pro is that we saved a lot of money.<br>
Con is that we can only do takeout and bring our own food containers, which is not convenient.</p>

<p>Overall it has more pros than cons. <br>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In a <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/06/10/playing-codenames-with-rust/">previous post</a> I implemented the game of Codenames in Rust, allowing a human player to interact with the computer playing randomly. Now let's implement a smarter computer agent, using word vectors. </p><p>Word vectors (or word embeddings) are a way of converting words into a high dimensional vector of numbers. This means that each word will have a long list of numbers associated with it and those numbers aren't completely random. Words that are related usually have values closer to each other in the vector space as well. Getting those numbers from raw data takes a long time, but there are many pretrained embeddings on the internet you can just use and there are also libraries that help you find other words that are close to a target word. </p><h2 id="word-vectors-in-rust">Word vectors in Rust</h2><p>Machine learning has embraced the Python programming language, so most ML tools, libraries and frameworks are in Python, but some are starting to show up in Rust as well. Rust's performance focus attracts people, because ML is usually computationally intensive. </p><p>There is one library in Rust that does exactly what we want: <a href="https://github.com/finalfusion/finalfusion-rust">FinalFusion</a>. It has a set of pretrained word vectors (quite fancy ones, with subword embeddings) and it has a library to load them and to make efficient nearest neighbor queries. </p><p>The pretrained embeddings come in a 5 GB file, because they pretty much literally have everything, including the kitchen sink, so the download will take a while. Let's start using the library (after adding it to our <code>Cargo.toml</code> file) to get the nearest neighboring words for "cat":</p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::WordSimilarity;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =
        Embeddings::read_embeddings(&amp;mut reader)
            .unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", embeddings.word_similarity("cat", 5).unwrap());
}</code></pre><p>After running it we get the following output:</p><pre><code>[WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.81729543), word: "cats" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.812261), word: "kitten" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7768222), word: "feline" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7760824), word: "kitty" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7667354), word: "dog" }]</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    
    <p>Loading a 5GB file from disk will take some time. If you have enough RAM, it should be in the OS's file cache after the first run, so it will load faster. Also, compiling this program with --release (turning on optimizations and removing debug information) will speed it up significantly. 
    </p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>One of the rules of Codenames is that hints can't be any of the words on the board or direct derivatives of them (such as plural forms). The <code>finalfusion</code> library has support for masking some words out, but to get plural forms I resorted to another library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Inflector"><code>inflector</code> </a>which has a method called <code><a href="https://docs.rs/Inflector/0.11.4/inflector/string/pluralize/index.html">to_plural</a></code>, which does exactly what's written on the box. </p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::EmbeddingSimilarity;
use std::collections::HashSet;
use inflector::string::pluralize::to_plural;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =
        Embeddings::read_embeddings(&amp;mut reader)
            .unwrap();
    let word = "cat";
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    let words = embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), 5, &amp;skip).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", words);
}</code></pre><p>This is a slightly lower level interface, where we first have to obtain the embedding of the word, we build the set of words to skip and then we search for the most similar words to the vector that we give it. The output is:</p><pre><code>[WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.812261), word: "kitten" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7768222), word: "feline" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7760824), word: "kitty" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7667354), word: "dog" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7471396), word: "kittens" }]</code></pre><p>It's better. Ideally, we could also somehow remove all composite words based on words from the table, but that's a bit more complicated.</p><p>This can be wrapped in a function, because it's a common use case:</p><pre><code>fn find_similar_words&lt;'a&gt;(word: &amp;str, embeddings: &amp;'a Embedding, limit: usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;WordSimilarityResult&lt;'a&gt;&gt; {
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(&amp;word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(&amp;word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), limit, &amp;skip).unwrap()
}
</code></pre><h2 id="implementing-the-first-spymaster">Implementing the first spymaster</h2><p>Let's implement our first spymaster which uses word vectors! First, let's define a type alias for the embedding type, because it's long and we'll use it many times.</p><pre><code>type Embedding = Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt;;</code></pre><p>Our spymaster will have two fields: the embeddings and the color of the player. The <code>Spymaster</code> trait requires only the <code>give_hint</code> function to be implemented.</p><pre><code>pub struct BestWordVectorSpymaster&lt;'a&gt; {
    pub embeddings: &amp;'a Embedding,
    pub color: Color,
}

impl Spymaster for BestWordVectorSpymaster&lt;'_&gt; {
    fn give_hint(&amp;mut self, map: &amp;Map) -&gt; Hint {
        let enemy_color = opposite_player(self.color);
        let remaining_words = map.remaining_words_of_color(enemy_color);
        let mut best_sim = NotNan::new(-1f32).unwrap();
        let mut best_word = "";
        for word in remaining_words {
            let words = find_similar_words(&amp;word, self.embeddings, 1);
            let hint = words.get(0).unwrap();
            if hint.similarity &gt; best_sim {
                best_sim = hint.similarity;
                best_word = hint.word;
            }
        }
        return Hint{count: 1, word: best_word.to_string()};
    }
}</code></pre><p>This spymaster uses a simple greedy algorithm. It takes each word that has to be guessed and find's the most similar word to it, while keeping track of the similarity. It returns as hint the word that had the highest similarity to any of the words that belong to the opposite team. </p><p>How does it do? I drew some random boards with a fixed seed and ran this spymaster on them. If you hover over the hint, it shows what are the words it's based on. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

       </div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unfortunately, the CC embeddings give even worse results.</p><h2 id="cleaning-up-the-embeddings">Cleaning up the embeddings</h2><p>My fix for this was to write a script to prune down the embeddings to only "real" words (ones made of only letters). First, I had to get a set of all these words. </p><pre><code>    let words = embeddings.vocab().words();
    let mut total = 0;
    let mut lowercase = 0;
    let mut select = HashSet::new();

            select.insert(w.clone());
        }
    }
    println!("{} {}", total,  lowercase);</code></pre><p>Then I had to get the embeddings and the norms for each of these words:</p><pre><code>    let mut selected_vocab = Vec::new();
    let mut selected_storage = Array2::zeros((select.len(), embeddings.dims()));
    let mut selected_norms = Array1::zeros((select.len(),));

    for (idx, word) in select.into_iter().enumerate() {
        match embeddings.embedding_with_norm(&amp;word) {
            Some(embed_with_norm) =&gt; {

                    .assign(&amp;embed_with_norm.embedding);
                selected_norms[idx] = embed_with_norm.norm;
            }
            None =&gt; panic!("Cannot get embedding for: {}", word),
        }

        selected_vocab.push(word);
    }
</code></pre><p>And finally write the now much smaller embedding file:</p><pre><code>    let new_embs = Embeddings::new(
        None,
        SimpleVocab::new(selected_vocab),
        NdArray::from(selected_storage),

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		    <div id="attachment_2355"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2355" src="http://micawberprinciple.com/wp-content/uploads/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning_USAF-e1509685065667.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2355">Lockheed P-38 Lightning. My Father Built these Planes During WWII, and He Always Loved Them.</p></div>
<p><span>The year is 1943 and America is deep in the desperate struggle to save the world from tyranny. The United States had entered World War II a little more than a year earlier following the December 7, 1941 attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor.</span></p>
<p><span>As the United States ramped up the war effort the government decided that to win this fight, in addition to brave soldiers and superior equipment, they would also need help from the brightest minds in the world. This lead to the founding of the Statistical Research Group (SRG). The SRG was located in Manhattan, just a block away from Columbia University, and before long many of the best mathematicians in the world were working there.</span></p>
<p><span>How smart were the people working at the SRG? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milton Friedman</a>, a future winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, worked at the SRG and it was later joked that while he was there he was often only the fourth smartest person in the room.</span></p>
<p><span>And who was the smartest? That was widely recognized to be the brilliant mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Wald</a>, a Jew who had fled Europe prior to the start of the war.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force came to Wald with a problem. Too many of their planes were being shot down so they wanted to add extra armor to the vulnerable parts of the planes. Too much armor would make the planes too heavy to fly properly, so they couldn’t add extra armor over the entire plane. They asked Wald to tell them how much extra armor to add to the parts of the planes that were being hit most often.</span></p>
<p><span>To help Wald they had collected statistics on the bullet holes in planes returning from combat. They presented him the following statistics:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Section of Plane</span></strong></span></td>
<td><span><strong><span>Bullet Holes Per Sq. Ft.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Engine</span></td>
<td><span>1.11</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuselage</span></td>
<td><span>1.73</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuel System</span></td>
<td><span>1.55</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Rest of Plan</span></td>
<td><span>1.80</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>Given these statistics, what would you tell the Air Force?</span></p>
<p><span>The answer Wald came up with&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;them. He instructed the Air Force to put the extra armor not where the bullet holes were, but were they weren’t – on the engines! And how did Wald come up with this answer. Simple. He considered the missing bullet holes. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force had presented him with statistics on planes that had returned safely from combat. Wald recognized this as biased sample that told a distorted and incomplete story. There were also a lot of planes at the bottom of the ocean, and Wald correctly guessed that these planes were full of bullet holes in the engines.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force followed his advice and the results were stunning. Immediately more planes started returning safely from combat saving the lives of countless pilots and crew members.</span></p>
<p><span>Wald correctly identified this as not so much a math problem but as a problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survivorship bias</a>, and once you understand this concept you start seeing it everywhere. Survivorship bias tells a lot of distorted and incomplete stories and looking for the missing bullet holes, as Wald had done, can save you from making bad decisions based on inaccurate and incomplete information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fortune Cookie Lottery Winners</strong></h2>
<p><span>On March 30, 2005 the Powerball lottery drawing produced 110 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners who had picked 5 of the 6 numbers correctly. This entitled each of them to winnings of over $100,000. Lottery officials found this strange since, based on the number of tickets sold, there should have only been about 5 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners.</span></p>
<p><span>Searching for an explanation the officials asked winners how they had picked their numbers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/world/americas/as-the-cookie-crumbles-winners-galore-in-lottery.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An article</a> in The New York Times described what happened next:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Our first winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie,” said Rebecca Paul, chief executive of the Tennessee Lottery. “The second winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie. The third winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie.” </em></span></p>
<p><span>The fortune cookie with the lucky numbers was eventually traced to a factory in Long Island City, owned by Wonton Food, which produces four million fortune cookies a day.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“That’s ours,” said Derrick Wong, of Wonton Food, when shown a picture of a winner’s cookie slip. “That’s very nice, 110 people won the lottery from the numbers.”</em></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/10/taking-financial-advice-from-a-lottery-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reporting</a> on the incident <a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Carlson</a> wrote cynically, but more truthfully than we care to admit, “If any of these 110 people worked in the investment business they probably would have started their own newsletter – </span><em><span>My Secret Formula for Winning the Lottery.”</span> </em></p>
<p><span>And they could have made the newsletter sound very convincing. After all, the author could have pointed to109 other people who also followed this formula and won big. But you wouldn’t fall for it, because you would look for the missing bullet holes, and you understand that there are thousands of planes piloted by fortune-cookie-lottery-number-picking pilots laying at the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Other Examples of Survivorship Bias</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Many investing companies start new mutual funds in what are known as “fund incubators.” These funds, employing various strategies, are kept small and are not available for public investing. After several years in the incubator the most successful ones are rolled out to the public touting their stellar investment records. The underperformers are discontinued in an attempt to keep the missing bullet holes hidden forever.</span></li>
<li><span>In the classic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00CLT31D6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509685860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Millionaire Next Door </em></a>authors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Stanley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas J. Stanley</a> and William D. Danko state that business owners make up the largest group of millionaires next door. But this is not the same as saying that most business owners are millionaires. Most businesses fail and the ocean floor is littered with planes piloted by brave but ultimately unsuccessful entrepreneurs. So before jumping in and starting your own business, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
<li><span>My wife and daughter love the real estate shows on HGTV. These shows make flipping houses look effortless and exciting. And there is no shortage of books and infomercials telling you how easy it is to make money buying real estate with little or no money down. While it is certainly possible to make money in real estate, it is not easy. Don’t forget to look for the missing bullet holes. They are not difficult to find. Lots of would-be real estate tycoons, including personal finance radio guru Dave Ramsey, have crashed in spectacular fiery fashion. Before you start flipping houses, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>My purpose in discussing survivorship bias is not to talk you out of taking risks. Indeed, I believe that anything worth doing involves risk. I just don’t think you should take risks based on the distorted and incomplete picture that survivorship bias presents.</span></p>
<p><span>Speaking of this Ben Carlson said, “Every inspirational speech by someone successful should have to start with a disclaimer about survivorship bias.”</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, clear up the picture first by searching out the missing bullet holes and seeing what you can learn from them. They often tell the most interesting and useful part of the story. This won’t guarantee you success but it will increase your chances for a safe return by allowing you to put some extra armor on the vulnerable areas of your plane. After doing that, buckle your seat belt and prepare for takeoff!</span></p>
<p>Note: I read the story of the missing bullet holes in the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509686186&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+not+to+be+wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</a>, </em>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Ellenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Ellenberg</a>.</p>

You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. </p><p>If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on. </p><p>I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. </p><p>This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an hour’s worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the information and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard over ten years, you’ll get what you want.&nbsp;[77]</p><blockquote><h2>How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):</h2><h2> ↓ </h2><h2>Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” </h2><h2>—Archimedes </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. <br>↓ </h2><h2>Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.&nbsp;[11] </h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2>Summary: Productize Yourself </h2></blockquote><p><strong>Your summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that mean?</strong> </p><p>“Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself ” has uniqueness. “Productize” has leverage. “Yourself” has accountability. “Productize” has specific knowledge. “Yourself ” also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.</p><p>If you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic.&nbsp;[78] </p><p>This is hard. This is why I say it takes decades—I’m not saying it takes decades to execute, but the better part of a decade may be figuring out what you can uniquely provide.&nbsp;[10] </p><p><strong>What’s the difference between wealth and money? </strong></p><p>Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time. </p><p>If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.”&nbsp;[78] </p><p>Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. </p><p>Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise. </p><p>So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.&nbsp;[78]</p><blockquote><h2>Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone. </h2></blockquote><p>Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.</p><p>Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich. </p><p>So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet&nbsp;[correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities. </p><p>Then, you have to figure out how to scale it because if you only build one, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them so everybody can have one. Steve Jobs (and his team, of course) figured out society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times one hundred and was easy to use. So, they figured out how to build it, and then they figured out how to scale it.&nbsp;[78]</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>To increase the reliability of deploys and safely deploy broad-reaching changes, we need to change something about our engineering culture around creating changes.</p>

<p>Often, when someone works on changes that span multiple services, they think of it as a separate Pull Request for every <em>project</em>. Then, when it comes to deploy day, there’s a concern: We want to make a change to X but Y also needs that change to work - how do we deploy these at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>We don’t.</strong></p>
<p>No matter how much of our time or you brilliant engineers we dedicate to this topic, there’s no way to guarantee that changes to two projects takes effect at the <em>exact same time</em>. There will always be, at minimum, valuable seconds (and hundreds of requests) between one service starting up with the new version and another.</p>

<p>To fix this, we need to modify how we think about our changes from not just per-feature but to per-phase per-feature. What I mean is, there are actually two phases to every feature’s deployment:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Migration</strong>: We add or modify behaviour while retaining backwards-compatibility with what currently exists.</li>
<li><strong>The Cleanup</strong>: We remove the old behaviour and only keep the backwards-<em>in</em>compatible change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="example-one-databases">Example One: Databases</h2>
<p>Around databases is somewhere this concept is used extensively. When you make a change to an existing database schema, you need to temporarily have your app support both versions of the schema until the change is complete.</p>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Our customers database needs to change two columns first_name and surname into one column full_name as some places don’t have the concept of first/last names.</p>
<p><strong>The Method:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, we need to understand that two services need a change: our database and our application. We need to change the schema of our database tables and change our application to write those new values to the right column.</p>
<p>For our database:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[DB1]</strong> that <em>adds</em> a new <code>full_name</code> optional column and <em>changes</em> the <code>first_name</code> and <code>surname</code> columns to be optional (by accepting a <code>null</code> or empty value).</li>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[DB2]</strong> that <em>removes</em> <code>first_name</code> and <code>surname</code>, and <em>changes</em> the <code>full_name</code> column to be mandatory (by requiring a non-empty value).</li>
</ul>
<p>For our application:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[APP1]</strong> that <em>removes</em> the <code>first_name</code> and <code>surname</code> columns from the data it writes, and <em>adds</em> the <code>full_name</code> column to the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we deploy them in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[DB1]</strong> - all columns exist and our app is writing to the first and surname columns.</li>
<li><strong>[APP1]</strong> - our application stops writing to the first and surname columns, now it will start writing to the full name column instead.</li>
<li><strong>[DB2]</strong> - the app is writing to the new column so we can remove the old columns now.</li>
</ol>
<p>By splitting our database changes into a migration and cleanup step, we were able to deploy our changes without having to worry about if the app was writing to the old or new columns.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this is that we can have <em>any</em> amount of time between merging the PRs as long as they’re in the above order.</p>
<h2 id="example-two-dependent-applications">Example Two: Dependent Applications</h2>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>We have two applications Auth and App. We’re going to be changing from usernames to email addresses for our authentication and need to change the API.</p>
<p><strong>The Method:</strong></p>
<p>Although we could do something really hacky and support email addresses in the <code>username</code> field, it’s probably not the right thing to do and would confuse people later for sure.</p>
<p>For Auth:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[Auth1]</strong> that <em>changes</em> the API validation for the <code>username</code> field to be optional, and <em>adds</em> the new <code>email</code> field as well as an if-branch that checks against an email if it’s specified, else it checks against the username as normal.</li>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[Auth2]</strong> that <em>removes</em> <code>username</code> from the API validation, and makes the <code>email</code> field mandatory, as well as removing the if-branch - only leaving the branch that authenticates with emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>For App:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[App1]</strong> that <em>changes</em> the request from using <code>username</code> to using <code>email</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we deploy them in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[Auth1]</strong> - the application is still using <code>username</code> for auth.</li>
<li><strong>[App1]</strong> - the application switches to using <code>email</code> instead.</li>
<li><strong>[Auth2]</strong> - we are no longer using the <code>username</code> field so we can remove it now.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another method we could use to solve this is to create a new API endpoint in [Auth1] (leaving the current endpoint) and then remove the old endpoint in [Auth2]. The PR [App1] would then be to use the <code>email</code> field and change the request’s API endpoint. The order would remain the same though.</p>
<p>Something you may have noticed about this example is that I didn’t include the changes you would probably also have to make to your database. If you’d like, as a thought exercise: just on a high level, try to think about what PRs we’d make to change the <code>username</code> column to an <code>email</code> column and figure out where you would insert those PRs into the above deployment steps.</p>

<p>An API-breaking change is anything that alters the contract between two services. It is anything that would require the consumer of your API to make a change in order to keep working properly. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A REST API endpoint’s path/URL changes</li>
<li>An API introduces new, <em>required</em> fields or changes the current set of required fields</li>
<li>An API <em>removes</em> a field</li>
<li>An API changes the data it returns</li>
<li>An API changes the structure or status code of a response</li>
</ul>
<p>What is <strong>not</strong> an API-breaking change?</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing new, <em>optional</em> fields</li>
<li>Changing currently-required fields to be optional</li>
<li>Changing what an API does as long as it doesn’t affect a dependent service/application</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community. I hope all these information can help people to understand the situation, and help potential contributors to take part in.</p><p>Of course, Rust on LLVM has gone so far away, but what would I

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

      <p>Every developer needs access to some servers for example to check the application logs.</p>
<p>Usually, this is done using public-private key encryption where each developer generates their own public-private key pair.
The public keys of each developer are added to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file on each server they should have access to.</p>
<h2 id="painful-manual-changes">Painful manual changes</h2>
<p>So far so good. However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?</p>
<p>In that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers. This could be quite a bit of work depending on how many servers they had access to.
And even worse, if it’s done manually, there is quite some risk that the key is still forgotten on some server, so the access remains open.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-solutions">Alternative solutions</h2>
<p>There are some commercial and open source solutions out there which want to help out with this problem. The basic idea is that you add and maintain the keys and the access lists on that service and when you remove a key, they will remove it from all your servers.</p>
<p>Sounds good, but it has one very big disadvantage: it’s a potential single source of failure. If someone captures access to that service, they can gain access to all your servers. And if you lose access to that service, you also lose access to all your servers in the worst case.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-signing-keys">The solution: signing keys</h2>
<p>When I was facing this problem, I asked on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24157180">HackerNews</a> how others are tackling this problem.</p>
<p>There were some great suggestions and insights from the community and the best solution to the problem seems to be the signing of keys which I will present to you here in detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-rough-idea">The rough idea</h3>
<p>The rough idea is this: You still generate a public-private key pair for each developer. However, you don’t upload the public keys to your servers.</p>
<p>Instead, you sign the public keys with a so-called certificate authority (CA) key which you generate before. This signing simply generates a third certificate file which you give back to the developer and they put it inside of their <code>.ssh/</code> folder next to the private and public key.</p>
<p>On the servers, you simply tell the server the public key of your CA and the server can detect if a user has a properly signed certificate and only allows access to the developers who have such a signed certificate.</p>
<h3 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h3>
<p>When you sign a certificate, you can determine how long that signing is valid. So if you sign it with a validity of 3 months and the developer leaves the company, then after 3 months they won’t have access to any of the servers for sure.</p>
<p>Now you say: well, but I don’t want to sign keys of everyone every 3 months which is a fair point.</p>
<p>One possibility is to automate the process for example by building a service where a user can automatically get a signed certificate when they authorize with their company e-mail and password, but that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>The simple alternative is that you issue certificates that are valid longer and then if someone leaves the company, you can revoke the certificate, i.e. invalidate it. You can put a list of invalid certificates on your servers and they will not accept the user any more.
This could for example be done by having this list on AWS S3 or some other storage and a cronjob on each server that regularly pulls this.</p>
<h3 id="show-me-how-to-do-this">Show me how to do this</h3>
<p>Glad that you asked!</p>
<p>It’s actually super simple once you know the drill.</p>
<p>First, you generate a certificate authority public-private key pair of which you should keep the private key very secure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">umask <span>77</span>                        <span># you want it to be private</span>
mkdir ~/my-ca <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd ~/my-ca
ssh-keygen -C CA -f ca -b <span>4096</span>  <span># be sure to use a passphrase and store it securely</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then on your server you specify that all users signed by your CA are allowed to access the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the public key of your CA on your server, e.g. at <code>/etc/ssh/ca.pub</code></li>
<li>Tell the server to allow access to users signed by it by adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub <span># Trust all with a certificate signed by ca.pub</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>Now if a developer generated their public-private key pair (e.g. <code>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521</code>), they simply send you their public key (note that you never need to send any private keys around!).
Then you sign their public key to generate their certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Inside your ~/my-ca folder, sign their public key (here: id_ecdsa.pub)</span>
ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -V +12w -z <span>1</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>Quick explanation for the different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s ca</code> - you want to use your CA to sign</li>
<li><code>-I USER_ID</code> - the id of your user / the username</li>
<li><code>-V +12w</code> - how long before the certificate expires - here valid for 12 weeks</li>
<li><code>-z 1</code> - the serial number of this certificate - can be used to make this particular certificate invalid later, should be unique</li>
<li><code>id_ecdsa.pub</code>: the public key of the developer which you want to sign</li>
</ul>
<p>It will generate the certificate <code>id_ecdsa-cert.pub</code> which you can send to the developer and they put it into their <code>~/.ssh</code> folder next to their public-private key pair.</p>
<h3 id="it-gets-even-better">It gets even better</h3>
<p>Sounds cool, right? But you can do even better!</p>
<p>You probably have developers with different experience and different teams and roles and not everyone accessing the same servers.</p>
<p>So let’s add roles into the signing process!</p>
<p>That way, on the server you specify which roles are allowed to access the server and during the signing process you specify the roles of the developer you are signing.</p>
<p>Then, that developer can access all servers matching to their roles.</p>
<p>When you on board a new developer, you only need to generate that one certificate and boom they have access to all relevant servers without adding anything on those servers.</p>
<p>Here is how this looks like schematically:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/how-to-properly-manage-ssh-keys-for-server-access/ssh-keys-with-roles.png" alt="ssh certificate signing with roles">
    
      <figcaption>ssh certificate signing with roles</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>This is how you configure roles on a server:</p>
<p>First, create the folder to configure access: <code>sudo mkdir /etc/ssh/auth_principals</code>
Inside that folder, you can create files with the name of the server user that someone could login as. For example to grant root access to some roles, add the file <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code>.</p>
<p>Inside <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code> you simply list all roles which should be able to login as root with one role per line:</p>
<p>Finally, configure on the server to use roles by again adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">AuthorizedPrincipalsFile /etc/ssh/auth_principals/%u
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>This is how you sign a key with roles (they are added to the certificate):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -n ROLE1,ROLE2 -V +12w -z <span>2</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>It’s the same as before, but with the <code>-n ROLE1,ROLE2</code> flag. Important: there can’t be spaces between the comma for different roles!</p>
<p>Now, that developer could log onto any server where <code>ROLE1</code> or <code>ROLE2</code> are in an auth_principals file for a user name they try to login as.</p>
<h3 id="revoking-keys">Revoking keys</h3>
<p>Finally, if you want to invalidate a certificate, you can do that by the user name or the serial number of the certicate (<code>-z</code> flag). It’s recommended to make a list of generated certificates in an Excel spreadsheet or have a database depending on the number of your peeps.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -k -f revoked-keys -u -s ca list-to-revoke
</code></pre></div><p>This is when you already have a <code>revoked-keys</code> list and want to update it (<code>-u</code> flag). For the initial generation, use it without the update flag.</p>
<p>The <code>list-to-revoke</code> needs to consist of usernames (ids) or serial numbers (<code>-z</code> flag during generation) like this:</p>
<pre><code>serial: 1
id: test.user
</code></pre><p>This would revoke access to the certificate with serial 1 and all certificates with id <code>test.user</code>.</p>
<p>To make the server respect revoked keys, you need to add the generated / updated <code>revoked keys</code> file to <code>/etc/ssh/revoked-keys</code> and configure it again in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<p>Warning: make sure that the <code>revoked-keys</code> file is accessable and readable, otherwise you might lose access to your server</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked-keys
</code></pre></div><h2 id="summary-good-ssh-key-management">Summary: good ssh key management</h2>
<p>In my opinion, this solution is as good as it gets. You have the option to manage the access to your servers via ssh based on roles. You only need to configure your servers once (which roles are allowed to access it). For each new developer, you only need to generate a signed certificate and they immediately have access to all relevant machines matching their role / experience.
And when they leave the company, you can revoke their access also in a simple way.</p>
<p>And even if a mishap occurs and a developer leaves without having their access revoked, their certificate will expire after some time, so they also lose access automatically.</p>
<p>For small teams, you can do these steps manually as they are very fast to do; then as you grow, you can automate the certificate signing with a login service based on company authentication details.</p>
<p>Happy ssh-ing!</p>

<p>AWS Lightsail doesn’t usually show up in a list of AWS’ most popular services. However, Lightsail can be a great service to use especially if you are looking for a service that is easy to set up and has low maintenance. In this article, we will take a deeper look into Lightsail, when to use it and compare it to some of its competitors.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail is a collection of building blocks that make it easy to get a web application up and running pretty quickly. These building blocks are:</p>

<h2 id="lightsail-instances">Lightsail Instances</h2>
<p>These instances are analogous to Virtual Private Servers (VPS) which are backed by EC2 instances (most likely the t2/t3 family) under the hood. AWS provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing what kind of instance you want to run.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail can be created in the following AWS Regions (as of September, 2020):</p>
<ul>
<li>US East (Ohio) (us-east-2)</li>
<li>US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)</li>
<li>US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Mumbai) (ap-south-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Seoul) (ap-northeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)</li>
<li>Canada (Central) (ca-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Frankfurt) (eu-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)</li>
<li>EU (London) (eu-west-2)</li>
<li>EU (Paris) (eu-west-3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lightsail also provides several options for the base image that you use for instance. You can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Only</strong>: You can choose from various Linux/Unix-based or a Windows-based OS</li>
<li><strong>Apps + OS</strong>: If you are planning to run a CMS like Wordpress or application on top of Django or Node, you can choose an image that installs these applications by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about Lightsail instance images can be found <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-1.png" alt="instance-1" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-2.png" alt="instance-2" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p>One of the best features of Lightsail is its clear and transparent pricing. You can create an instance that best fits your needs and you can be confident of how much it will cost you at the end of the month. AWS is notorious for complex billing and this can put off a lot of new customers.</p>
<p>Lightsail instances come with generous data transfer limits which is definitely a big improvement.</p>
<p>AWS recently added <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms">support for alarms in Lightsail</a>. This is a big improvement since previously there was no way to set up an alert for Lightsail system metrics such as CPU utilization.</p>
<p>You also have the flexibility of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/features/upgrade-to-ec2/">upgrading your instance</a> to EC2 in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-3.png" alt="instance-3" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<h3 id="loadbalancers">Loadbalancers</h3>
<p>Lightsail provides the option of adding a loadbalancer to your stack if you need to distribute traffic across your instances. Lightsail also lets you generate free SSL certificates from the UI itself and they work seamlessly with the loadbalancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/loadbalancer-1.png" alt="loadbalancer-1" title="AWS Lightsail Loadbalancer"></p>
<h3 id="managed-database">Managed Database</h3>
<p>Lightsail lets you create a managed MySQL or PostgreSQL database easily. Lightsail makes certain database administration tasks much simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated database snapshots</li>
<li>Resize your database from a snapshot</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/database-1.png" alt="database-1" title="AWS Lightsail Database"></p>
<h3 id="dns-management">DNS Management</h3>
<p>Lightsail makes it easy to direct traffic from your custom domain to your instances. This can be done by either creating a static IP or a DNS zone for your domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/dns-1.png" alt="dns-1" title="AWS Lightsail DNS"></p>
<h3 id="lightsail-pros--cons">Lightsail: Pros &amp; Cons</h3>
<p>Like with any cloud service, Lightsail has its pros and cons. Some of the more obvious ones are:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</strong>: Pricing is clear and you have a good idea of what your monthly expenses would be.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: Lightsail’s UI is straightforward and easy to use especially when compared to the AWS console.</li>
<li><strong>Low maintenance:</strong> Most of the lightsail services (DNS, Loadbalancers, Database) are managed and thus the operational burden of running your application in Lightsail is pretty low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightsail is missing some advanced features such as:
<ul>
<li>Security groups: there is no support for security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. You need to use firewalls to achieve the same.</li>
<li>If the rest of your infrastructure is on Terraform, it might be hard to fully provision all Lightsail services using Terraform since some of the services <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+lightsail">aren’t yet supported</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, it is not possible to upgrade your Lightsail database to RDS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lightsail-alternative-lightsail-vs-digitalocean">Lightsail Alternative: Lightsail vs DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean is LightSail’s main competitor. The target audience for both of these services are developers who want to be able to spin up their web services easily. We will try to compare these two offerings to get a better idea of how these services stack up against each other.</p>
<p>They’ve taken the relatively complex process of deploying servers to the cloud and simplified the entire process. Their UI is beautifully designed and cloud servers can be deployed within minutes. Pricing has always been transparent and you know what you’ll be paying each month upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Lightsail and DigitalOcean are pretty comparable when it comes to the features they both offer. They both provide an easy-to-use interface for setting up as well as APIs for any programmatic setup. When it comes to choosing a server, they both provide a lot of choices. One can go with a The table below compares the two across various dimensions:</p>

<p><a href="https://joshtronic.com/2020/09/06/vps-showdown-digitalocean-lightsail-linode-upcloud-vultr/">The blog post</a> does a comprehensive performance comparion between various VPS providers. Lightsail and DigitalOcean performed comparably in these tests.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-lightsail">When to use Lightsail</h3>
<p>When it comes to choosing between Lightsail and DigitalOcean, there are a few factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are already using AWS, it makes sense to use Lightsail.</li>
<li>If you are planning to use other AWS services or you might upgrade from Lightsail to EC2, it makes sense to use LightSail.</li>
<li>If you haven’t used either of these services before, you are probably better off starting with DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is simple and straightforward to use and this is their main business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Lightsail is a service targeted towards developers who probably haven’t used AWS before or want a service that is easy to use with minimal maintenance overhead.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons to use Lightsail:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need for prior AWS knowledge</li>
<li>Get a complete web service up &amp; running in less than an hour</li>
<li>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/09/vscode-remote-ssh/">rediscovered</a> the ability of Visual Studio Code to develop on remote machines. Just connect to a server via SSH and develop there.</p><p>Even though I’m using Git, I don’t have to commit everything immediately to continue development on another machine, I don’t have to take care to keep all my development tools up to date on all my machines, and I can continue working from my Surface Go with Windows exactly where I left off with my Ubuntu desktop. And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.</p><p>All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.</p><hr><p>But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:</p><p>To program in Go, I mainly used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA Ultimate</a> from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.</p><p>However, since I won’t be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoLand</a> from JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t very cheap</a> (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.</p><p>The second best option for developing Go is probably <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>. The Go team took over the development of <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go extension</a> not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.</p><p>VS Code is free, partly even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.</p><p>For VS Code there is an extension called “Remote - SSH” (documentation is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It’s like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.</p><p>As a server I use the cheapest option from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner Cloud</a>. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don’t need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.</p><p>This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don’t have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the “Remote - SSH” extension.</p><p>It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server <code>gopls</code> is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.</p><p>My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.</p><p>The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6682ce0e9be9292fb093d16e4b89a6cbec481554/1fe8d/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons.png" alt="SaaS Startups Using Sign Up Buttons"></p>

<p>The fate of many&nbsp;startups depends almost entirely on one&nbsp;conversion point: When a visitor becomes a user.</p>

<p>All too often, this pivotal role&nbsp;falls on the shoulders of a pitifully generic “sign up” button that’s lucky to get even a minute of consideration during development.</p>

<p>If you take a moment to consider the wording of your signup button, you can drastically increase how many of your visitors turn into users.</p>

<p><em>(What happens after the conversion is important, too, but things get significantly easier once you have someone’s email and opt-in.)</em></p>
<h2>Why "Sign Up" buttons don't work.</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>They're&nbsp;ignored.&nbsp;</strong>When visitors see common elements repeated on many sites, they begin unconsciously ignoring those elements (aka "habituation").&nbsp;Doesn't matter if they're blue or green or hell-fire-orange.</li>
  <li><strong>You're asking for blind commitment.</strong>&nbsp;Don't&nbsp;assume visitors&nbsp;know what you're asking them to sign up for. People don't read pages, they skim. They could've easily missed the part where you mention a&nbsp;free trial or key benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>You're not offering any value.</strong> Asking someone to "sign up" offers no help in changing the visitor's thinking from "Why should I?" to "I want this!"</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get more signups&nbsp;from your signup button:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tie it to your product.</strong> If you have a SaaS for trading bitcoins: "Start Trading Bitcoins." If&nbsp;you have a marketplace for artists: "Start Selling Art." This helps prevent the button from being overlooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Give, don't take.</strong> "Get Access" and "Sign Up" both lead to the same thing, but one makes the visitor feel they're getting something, while the other doesn't.</li>
  <li><strong>Compel people to act.</strong> Use action verbs such as <em>get</em>, <em>start</em>, and <em>try</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples from startups that get it right:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a5e786dc725cdf0d2cc7d265cf2130fd5e785f5e/09f83/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons-2.png" alt="Startups with Good Signup Buttons"></p>

<p>(I especially like gliffy’s “Start Drawing,” which implies how quickly you can get started, and directly relates to&nbsp;their product: <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">an app for easily drawing diagrams</a>.)</p>
<h2>Case study: Getting 3x more clicks by changing two words.</h2>
<p>Take this example from one of my clients. Like many software companies, Scalyr—a <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/">log aggregation and monitoring tool</a>—asked its visitors to “sign up.” I suggested that we test a version of the button that <em>gives</em> and <em>compels</em>: “Try it Free”. Here’s what happened:</p>

<p><strong>Asking visitors to <em>Try it Free</em> <span>increased clicks by 212%</span>.</strong></p>

<p>Complete obliteration of the old “Sign Up” button, and a&nbsp;huge win for a test that took two minutes to set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7562f9ce9e08b024e6c838126e1d6f54e24e07ed/7465d/images/uploads/scalyr-test-result.png" alt="A/B test on Scalyr resulted in 212% increase in clicks."></p>
<h2>Now try it yourself...</h2>
<p>Test a variation of your “sign up” button with something that <em>gives</em>,&nbsp;<em>compels</em>, and is <em>tied to your product</em>. It’s one of the easiest things to test, and could have a huge effect on your conversion rates. If you follow my advice then you’re almost certain to do better than asking visitors to “sign up.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a followup to my post about a year ago, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/ui/druid/2019/11/22/reactive-ui.html">Towards a unified theory of reactive UI</a>. It is a deeper exploration of the question: “what is the best way to express reactive UI in Rust?”</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is an astonishing diversity of “literature” on reactive UI systems. I put “literature” in quotes here, because, with some exceptions, the best primary sources are the code of open source projects. Some of the diversity comes from differences in goals, but some of it is accidental. In many cases, it’s simply because the designers didn’t have insight at the time about better solutions. My post last year attempted to put some order to this diversity, by discovering common patterns.</p>

<p>I believe it’s likely that the answer to “the best way to express reactive UI in Rust” is to be found in the existing literature, at least by combining major themes, if not in a single existing system to copy. It seems unlikely we’ll have to invent something completely new. But sorting through it is not easy. It is not the intent of this post to provide a comprehensive review of the literature (though I think such a thing would be interesting), it is to guide inquiry into the most promising avenues. I want to do mining, not stamp collecting. Where is the richest vein of ore?</p>

<p>To focus the inquiry, I will start by listing some goals. While in general these goals all seem like good things, it’s important to understand them as tradeoffs. Prioritizing different goals will lead you to different places, and not everyone has the same needs. Take overall system complexity, for example. If you’re a trillion dollar corporation, then a complex system is merely a question of allocating resources, and may even be strategically useful as a moat to discourage competition. But if you’re an indie game developer trying to integrate basic UI, you have a very different perspective.</p>

<p>Each goal will be presented primarily as a way to introduce design decisions made by existing reactive systems, and filter the ones that seem most promising as sources and inspiration.</p>

<p>Then I will go into deeper into three principles, which I feel are critically important in any reactive UI framework: whether to use “observable objects,” how to express the mutation of the render object tree (or trees in general), and the notion of stable identity of nodes in that tree.</p>

<p>Finally, I will introduce <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/crochet">Crochet</a>, a research prototype built for the purpose of exploring these ideas.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="concise-expression-of-application-logic">Concise expression of application logic</h3>

<p>The main point of a reactive UI architecture is so that the app can express its logic clearly and concisely, and the results can drive the rest of the UI stack in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>A central feature of reactive UI is for the app to declaratively express the current state of the view tree. In traditional object-oriented UI, it’s more common to specify the initial state (often as a static document, not even code), plus additional logic for state changes. I think the debate is now essentially over, the reactive approach is winning.</p>

<p>SwiftUI has gained considerable attention due to its excellent ergonomics in this regard. But other approaches are also worth studying. In particular, immediate mode GUI (<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">imgui</a>) is nearly as declarative, it just achieves it in a very different way (about which more below). And React and its many derivatives are also “good enough.” <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> is another example from the JS world that deserves praise, though considerably more difficult to adapt to Rust because of its reliance on a sophisticated compiler.</p>

<p>It’s very popular in Rust GUI land to adapt <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm</a> patterns; we see clear influence in <a href="https://github.com/antoyo/relm">relm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bodil/vgtk">vgtk</a>, and others. But I think much of the conciseness and friendliness of Elm comes from the language itself, particularly its facility with higher-order composition. When adapting to a more pragmatic language such as Rust, I consider each subtask of view building and dispatching messages to components as each a half-lens, requiring the writing out of two pieces of logic to integrate a component. For this reason, I find Rust UI code adapted from Elm to be not as clear and concise as possible.</p>

<p>A great resource for comparing the concision of different toolkits is <a href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs</a>. We don’t have these ported to Crochet yet, except for counter, but plan to. For reference, here’s the <code>run</code> method for that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>fn</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>cx</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Label</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"current count: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.count</span><span>))</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>Button</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Increment"</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="actually-being-incremental">Actually being incremental</h3>

<p>While imgui can express UI concisely, it cheats somewhat by not being incremental. Generally, it makes up for this by being able to repaint the world very quickly (using GPU acceleration), but there are downsides, including power consumption. In the context of a game which is actively using the GPU anyway, it’s fine, but is a good reason not to choose imgui outside that context.</p>

<p>The documentation of <a href="https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod">Conrod</a> expresses a goal fairly well: “Conrod aims to adopt the best of both worlds by providing an immediate mode API over a hidden, retained widget state graph.” And once you have that, doing efficient incremental updates in the retained widget graph is a solved problem, though the details can be intricate. Unfortunately, I do not believe Conrod delivers on this promise, because app logic does an awful lot of explicit graph construction and juggling of node id’s, neither of which you would find in an actual immediate mode API.</p>

<p>On the other side, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, while having many desirable properties, does not satisfy the “actually incremental” goal: while there is caching in the renderer, it builds a full view tree every 16ms (actually twice when there are incoming events). This is fine when the view tree is relatively small, but is a serious problem at scale.</p>

<p>The popularity of “virtual DOM” approaches requires a discussion of diffing, which I feel is (modulo escape hatches for lower level direct tree mutation) a form of half-incrementality. The idea is that it should be cheap to produce a full view tree, then a reconciliation engine computes a minimal diff between that and the old tree, which is then be applied, through DOM mutation or some other means. Because DOM is slow, it’s certainly faster than ham-handed direct DOM mutation (which is difficult to make truly minimal), but still creates performance problems as the view tree grows. React programmers should be well familiar with this issue.</p>

<p>When escape hatches are provided, are they a reasonably principled way to achieve lower level access to tree mutation, simply shifting some tracking of state to the component (often a list view or similar collection), or are they a dirty hack to work around fundamental architectural decisions that limit performance? Both are represented in the literature.</p>

<h3 id="tab-focusing">Tab focusing</h3>

<p>It seems like a relatively simple feature, but proper implementation of tab focusing requires fairly deep architectural support (or, in the case of Web-based UI, it is punted to the browser). Basically, it requires the toolkit to maintain state of which widget is focused, and to query enough of the entire view tree to determine which is the next in tab focus order. Proponents of imgui have suggested a very hacky partial solution (see <a href="http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html">johno on IMGUI</a>), but I find such things unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Again, Iced is an example of an existing Rust GUI toolkit that is lacking this feature, and I think would require nontrivial architectural work to address, at least in a systematic way that would satisfy similar future needs. Down the line, those needs include accessibility, a serious Achilles heel for imgui-flavored designs in particular.</p>

<p>I believe a proper approach to this problem involves stable identity of widgets, about which much more below.</p>

<h3 id="simple-types">Simple types</h3>

<p>Now we get into more controversial goals. One that I personally am finding increasingly important is expressing the interface between app logic and UI toolkit using simple types.</p>

<p>Rust in particular invites the use of complex types, largely because it has a rich type system that is capable of expressing many concepts as types. By contrast, it’s traditional in object oriented UI to have very loosely coupled dynamic typing; a lot of the values being passed around have a type which is some variant of “any.”</p>

<p>A great example of complex types is SwiftUI, in which a component returns a statically-known type implementing the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view"><code>View</code></a> protocol. As a consequence, the concrete return type of a component generally encodes its entire view hierarchy, including special conditional and looping combinators; this is explained well in the <a href="https://www.objc.io/blog/2019/11/05/static-types-in-swiftui/">Static Types in SwiftUI</a> blog.</p>

<p>There are advantages to such a scheme, but also serious downsides. Error messages from the compiler get… interesting. And it also has a serious impact on compile times, as (at least in Rust) the compiler has to monomorphize the types before even starting to generate code.</p>

<p>To me, one of the most serious drawbacks to the complex type approach is that scripting languages can’t easily play, as the types must be known at compile time.</p>

<p>Again, imgui is an example of an architecture that avoids complex types, by drawing the UI directly rather than constructing an intermediate tree of view objects. But imgui is not the only such; another compelling example to learn from is <a href="https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/under-the-hood-of-jetpack-compose-part-2-of-2-37b2c20c6cdd">Jetpack Compose</a>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-control-flow">Simple control flow</h3>

<p>It is very tempting to use complex control flow patterns: putting significant logic in callbacks, using higher order composition techniques, or using a compiler to significantly transform the code. Yet, such techniques have downsides.</p>

<p>The first is simply that this complexity leaks out into the app. In current Druid, we use some higher order composition techniques such as lenses. While fairly simple by Haskell standards, and our users with Haskell background tend to like them, a lot of people coming to Druid find them confusing.</p>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>

<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>

<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success. The complete list of commands is in the  <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/SmarterCoffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;So just for illustration, by issuing this command:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="396" height="78" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption><em>making a nice cup of coffee with “default” settings</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker. As you can see, there is no security, so anyone who has access to the network and is able to reach the IP address of the coffee maker can control it. What is more interesting, is that all these commands are also available through that default opened Wi-Fi network when the device is not joined to a home network yet.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Let’s return to our main goal of hijacking the coffee maker for nefarious purposes. How secure is the updating process? Can we break into it? Can we even change the firmware to do something else than was originally intended? Can we turn the device into a physically dangerous device? Can we do it remotely? As I said in the beginning, the weakest link always compromises the whole system. Either it’s a network or a device. The goal is answering all the above questions and prove that IoT devices could be also compromised at the firmware level.</p>



<p>To start, we wanted to learn how the update process works. We have several options to do this, but we already have a recipe for this based on similar past research we have done. The general rule is to make it as simple as possible; here is our to-do list when trying to reverse the update process of a piece of firmware.</p>



<ol><li>Get it (the file with the firmware)</li><li>Unpack it (if it is packed/encrypted)</li><li>Reverse engineer it (translate those zeroes and ones into meaningful code)</li><li>Modify it (add the malicious content)</li><li>Upload it (and push it back to the device)</li></ol>



<p>It’s simple right?</p>







<p>First, we need to get the firmware somehow, and again there are several options. Let’s stick to the rule, the simplest option first:</p>



<ol><li>Google it – as obvious as it seems,&nbsp; sometimes security researchers omit this step which could save them a lot of work. Firmware is often available on the internet to be downloaded.</li><li>Capture and analyze network traffic – if the protocol is unencrypted the easiest way is to just capture the network traffic, in that case, we have three more options where to look<ul><li>traffic between the device and the internet</li><li>traffic between device and companion app, if there is any</li><li>traffic between the companion app and the internet</li></ul></li><li>Analyze and reverse engineer the companion app. Before we dive deeply into the device, it’s advisable to first peek into the device’s companion app, it’s usually the easiest solution for grabbing the communication protocol and commands.

It’s time to dismount the device, trace the board to identify all the components, get datasheets to find debugging ports, and possibly dump the firmware directly from the chip. This is really an adventure in hardware and not for everyone.</li></ol>



<p>Life is not so simple, and neither is reverse engineering IoT devices. It turned out that we had to use a combination of all the aforementioned techniques. First, we googled it, and as the commands have already been documented, we found a command that says <code>“update the firmware.”</code> But the command itself (its parameters and format) had not been documented. So by issuing:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png" alt="" width="396" height="78" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption>t<em>his simple (two bytes) command switches coffee maker into update mode</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>the coffee maker goes into an update mode (on the newer firmware you have to push a button to actually start the update, but this is not the case with older versions !)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zt-eEhReRyN8xe20y_NoBwNR_TCZ02Y87hyXVZDDiU6WtGGW2s4bmTBy37tdaIS9TBm5hLoBKwqcc1iE0tHjhC4HzVqqhSX_DB1bRUvGy9QTeuwGiYuSRVXTuoWxnkGFwOn57tVX" alt=""></figure></div>







<p>Hmm nice, but nothing happens. By analyzing network traffic, we concluded that there is nothing to analyze, as there is no traffic coming out of the coffee maker at this stage. So we tried the Android companion app.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png"><figcaption><em>Android application for smart coffee maker, right picture shows an update screen</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You can see the update button is grayed out, so obviously, the firmware is up-to-date and there is no easy option to push the firmware update to be able to see what’s in the network traffic. What’s interesting here is what’s missing. There was no communication to the internet neither from the coffee maker nor from the app. So how is it possible that the app knows that the coffee maker has the latest firmware? The only packets of data that went through were those between the machine and app when the app had been asking the machine for the version of the firmware.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="677" height="177" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png 677w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4-300x78.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"><figcaption>Typical traffic analysis of IoT with companion app: we are interested in traffic between app and internet and app and device.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/reUvllV7KNcZW0e9A4E_XljR0jknTZL-CLUbS3vJx0uiyArpgKdEVSpK1vEUUG0Q6Tu00I0wUlZMdQ8nG1w_Mdxz611TUCxA2DozEy0wftaC0qynZhhx8_pKNc6VeST1djzBgVti" alt=""><figcaption><em>Files inside the apk: You can see firmware for both products are contained in the two files with suffix .bin&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>The firmware is part of the Android app and it also means that new versions of the firmware always come with new versions of the app. This makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. The new firmware usually adds new functionality, which has to be reflected somehow inside the user interface of the app, and it allows us to find a file containing the firmware without even touching the device. That’s nice and not very common.</p>







<p>In the next step of my research we try to figure out …</p></div></article></div>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="111" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png 593w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>







<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>

<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success. The complete list of commands is in the  <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/SmarterCoffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>

<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker.

<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The firmware is part of the Android app and it also means that new versions of the firmware always come with new versions of the app. This makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. The new firmware usually adds new functionality, which has to be reflected somehow inside the user interface of the app, and it allows us to find a file containing the firmware without even touching the device. That’s nice and not very common.</p>

<p>MovingPandas is a Python library for handling movement data based on Pandas and <a href="https://geopandas.org/">GeoPandas</a>. 
It provides trajectory data structures and functions for analysis and visualization.</p>

<p>The MovingPandas repository is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/anitagraser/movingpandas">Github</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on individual releases, check out the <a href="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/changelog">Changelog</a>.</p>

<p>The official documentation is hosted on <a href="https://movingpandas.readthedocs.io/">ReadTheDocs</a>.</p>

<p>For an example use case, check out our <a href="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/3_horse_collar.html">movement data exploration tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>MovingPandas development started as a QGIS plugin idea in 2018. 
The resulting Trajectools plugin was first published in 2019. 
However, it became clear that the core trajectory handling classes should be extracted into 
in a separate library to make them usable outside the context of QGIS. 
This was the birth of MovingPandas.</p>

<p>In 2020, MovingPandas was approved for <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/">pyOpenSci</a>.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Convert GeoPandas GeoDataFrames of time-stamped points into MovingPandas Trajectories and TrajectoryCollections</li>
  <li>Add trajectory properties, such as movement speed and direction</li>
  <li>Split continuous observations into individual trips</li>
  <li>Generalize Trajectories</li>
  <li>Aggregate TrajectoryCollections into flow maps</li>
  <li>Create static and interactive visualizations for data exploration</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/pics/movingpandas_hvplot2.gif" alt="Interactive trajectory visualization using hvplot"></p>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>The MovingPandas repository contains multiple tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks that 
illustrate diverse analysis capabilities using different datasets, including: tracking data of ships, 
migration of birds, and tracks from a horse’s GPS collar. 
All MovingPandas tutorials are available on MyBinder - no installation required: 
<a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/anitagraser/movingpandas/binder-tag?filepath=tutorials/0_getting_started.ipynb"><img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="Binder"></a></p>

<p>MovingPandas Trajectory objects are created from GeoPandas GeoDataFrames. A minimal example would be:</p>

<p>MovingPandas provides static plots using Matplotlib and interactive plots using hvplot:</p>



<p><img src="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/pics/mp_fig1.png" alt="The trajectory is plotted as a blue line on a white background with latitude and longitude values labeled on the axes."></p>

<p>Matplotlib and hvplot parameters are passed along to the underlying libraries to enable extensive customization of plots:</p>

<h3 id="exploring-movement-characteristics">Exploring Movement Characteristics</h3>

<p>MovingPandas makes it straightforward to compute movement characteristics, such as trajectory length and duration, as well as movement speed and direction.</p>

<p>For example, we can explore the daily travelled distance as recorded by a GPS tracker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>read_file</span><span>(</span><span>'tracker.gpkg'</span><span>)</span>
<span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>.</span><span>set_index</span><span>(</span><span>'t'</span><span>)</span>
<span>tc</span> <span>=</span> <span>mpd</span><span>.</span><span>TrajectoryCollection</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>,</span> <span>'CollarID'</span><span>)</span>

<span>daily</span> <span>=</span> <span>mpd</span><span>.</span><span>TemporalSplitter</span><span>(</span><span>tc</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>mode</span><span>=</span><span>'day'</span><span>)</span>
<span>daily_lengths</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>traj</span><span>.</span><span>get_length</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>traj</span> <span>in</span> <span>daily</span><span>]</span>
<span>daily_t</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>traj</span><span>.</span><span>get_start_time</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>traj</span> <span>in</span> <span>daily</span><span>]</span>
<span>daily_lengths</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>daily_lengths</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>daily_t</span><span>,</span> <span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'length'</span><span>])</span>
<span>daily_lengths</span><span>.</span><span>hvplot</span><span>(</span><span>title</span><span>=</span><span>'Daily trajectory length'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/pics/mp_fig3.png" alt="The evolution of the length of the daily trajectories is plotted over the whole obseration period."></p>

<p>In this case, the movement data, which comes from a GPS collar of a horse, reveals that the animal tends to travel farther during summer days than during shorter winter days.</p>

<p>Other functions deal with trajectory generalization, splitting trajectories into subtrajectories, clipping trajectories to an area of interest, and extracting trajectory start and end times and locations.</p>

<p>God...dammit</p>


<p>It's hard to see a child outside today without some kind of iDevice pumping high fidelity 192kbps stereo lossless audio into their shiny white headphones, but <em>BACK IN MY</em> <em>DAY, </em>the iPod hadn't been invented yet. &nbsp;Pickings were slim. &nbsp;Walkmen were outdated, CD players were pricey and would skip if bumped around despite their ESP features, MiniDisk was another stillborn Sony format, and MP3 players were still ugly and ridiculously expensive (at least Apple fixed the ugly part).</p>
<p>Thus, Tiger Electronics, pioneers in the high tech market of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, invented "Hit Clips"</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="438" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9pgMmDmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hit Clips were small cheap digital audio players that could play music off of little plastic cartridges. &nbsp;The audio was mono, sounded terrible, and only included a 60 second sample of a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5621" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Better hold on to that patent Tiger...</p>
<p>Still, the songs were officially licensed and included bands like The Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Sugar Ray, and ...Dreamstreet</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Dream_street_blue_house" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="456" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg 635w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-300x215.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-417x300.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"></a></p>
<p>The 00s were a very strange time for all of us...</p>
<p>Anywho, while helping my 17 year old cousin move some furniture, we came across a large collection of hit clip cartridges, but no player. &nbsp;Struck with a wave of nostalgia, I asked if I could take one to do a tear down.</p>
<p>Thus this post.</p>

<p>The hit clip cartridge has 8 metal contacts on the back:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5620" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Taking it apart, I was hoping to find some identifiable piece of hardware, but instead found the chip-on-board construction that is so popular with super-low-cost low-power electronics along with a few discrete components.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5625" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Under this blob of epoxy is a wire-bonded chip of silicon. &nbsp;The song is likely hard coded directly into the silicon wafer rather than being programmed there after the fact using flash or OTP memory. &nbsp;It's cheaper that way if you make enough units.</p>
<p>This didn't give me a whole lot to work from, but assuming the capacitor is a bypass capacitor (decent assumption), I at least had some idea of how to power the thing. &nbsp;Poking around for a bit gave me this schematic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="hitclipschem" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what the two No Connect pins do, but apparently there was a version of the Hit Clip that allowed music to be recorded to special cartridges, so I'm guessing they have something to do with that.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much voltage the part needed, but a quick search on Ebay gave me some idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png"><img loading="lazy" title="ebay" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png" alt="" width="720" height="475" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png 720w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-300x197.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-454x300.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>3 AAAs means 4.5V. &nbsp;Also, can you believe people are bidding $40+ for these things?</p>
<p>Before I could get serious about debugging, I needed some way to connect traces to the board easily. &nbsp;I ended up soldering on some header pins and plugging it into a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5629" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>My original assumption was that the bottom-left pin was ground as it connected to the mystery chip more times than the other power-pin. &nbsp;You'll note the scratch-outs indicate that I was wrong. &nbsp;In that configuration, the chip drew 200+mA during the half-second that I left it connected. &nbsp;Presumably there's a reverse bias protection diode that I was blowing up.</p>
<p>Swapping the power pins around, the current started at around 280<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A before dropping to zero.</p>
<p>Convinced that I had it right, I moved to the other pins. &nbsp;There were four pins to chose from and a voltage measurement showed me that two of them were at the 4.5V rail while the other two were settled close to 0V.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since I had already identified my two power pins, I had to assume that these four pins were used for data somehow and that the two high pins had internal pull up resistors.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin1 to ground sinks about 12mA from that pin. &nbsp;12mA is much to high to be from a simple pull-up resistor. &nbsp;My guess is that it's some kind of output pin to tell the player that the cartridge is inserted all the way. I decided to leave it alone and move on to Pin 3.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin 3 to ground caused the circuit's current draw to rise from zero up to 300<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A. Removing this short did nothing to change the current increase although it did settle down after about 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This is when I knew I was on to something. &nbsp;60 seconds of current draw meant that this part was outputting its music sample! &nbsp;I was expecting the player to need to do something more complicated like pull bytes of music off the cartridge over a SPI bus or at least provide a clock source, but it turns out that the cartridge can handle that all by itself. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the two on-board series resistors are used for fine-tuning its internal clock source after the chip has been printed.</p>
<p>I quickly whipped out my oscilloscope and took a trace of Pin 2:</p>

<p>Data!</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><em>While doing a similar job on a different Hit Clip (Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men), I discovered different behavior. &nbsp;Connecting Pin 3 to ground did nothing while commenting pin 1 to&nbsp;ground toggled between data and no data. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there was a change in the Hit Clip design through generations, or if I took imprecise notes. &nbsp;The PCB layouts of the two clips is clearly different, and it looks like pin 3 is NC on the second clip.</em></p>
<p>I noticed an intermittent square wave with a period of almost exactly 24kHz and a duty cycle that varied with time. &nbsp;Pin 4 had similar data.</p>
<p>So there was definitely something going on here, and it was definitely digital somehow, but I needed some way to capture loads of digital data to later analyze. &nbsp;Fortunately, Santa gave me an 8 bit Saleae logic analyzer for Christmas:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I actually picked up the Hit Clip while looking for a good project to test this thing out. &nbsp;It's a really nice device, and the Windows/Mac/Linux compatible software is really slick.</p>
<p>Anywho, with the Saleae connected to Pin 2 and Pin 4, I reactivated the circuit and took a trace at a 24MHz sample rate. &nbsp;I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae trace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png" alt="" width="1647" height="986" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png 1647w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-300x179.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-1024x613.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px"></a></p>
<p>It was strange at first to see how the two data lines appeared to take turns, but once I remembered that Hit Clips only output in mono, it made a lot more sense. &nbsp;These two lines are encoding the same mono stream of audio.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the low-going blips, I noticed that they were quantized. &nbsp;The length of each blip was always near some integer multiple of 0.3333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about audio amplifiers, I theorized that these two outputs are meant to directly drive the push and pull FETs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a> in real time. &nbsp;In other words, a blip on one line pulls the waveform output voltage up while a blip on the other pulls it down. &nbsp;The width of the blip indicates how hard (or for how long) it pulls.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Redditor urquan points out that this kind of modulation is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation">Sigma-Delta Modulation</a>.</p>
<p>While it's technically a digital output, it's encoded in such a way that it can be fed directly into an analog circuit.</p>
<p>I figured that if I could give myself a stream of this data, I could probably simulate the output digitally. &nbsp;To cut down on the number of samples, I exported the trace to a CSV file that only records timestamps when something changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae output" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png" alt="" width="534" height="810" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png 534w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In order to make use of this data, I just needed to record how much time passed between a signal dropping low and rising up again, and I should have such data points arriving at almost exactly 24kHz. &nbsp;All of the data from one pin was given a positive value while the data from the other pin was given a negative value.</p>
<p>I also tried quantizing the data by dividing the time delays by 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s, and while this worked for small numbers, I noticed that some of the larger numbers fell pretty far from a solid integer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>It looked like 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s was a bad estimate of the actual quantization time. &nbsp;Thinking a little more critically, I noticed that a 24kHz wave has a period of 41.67<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s. &nbsp;When divided by my quantization time, this comes out to almost exactly 125 which is pretty darn close to 128, a power of two.</p>
<p>Changing my quantization time to 0.3255<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s or <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d7efcee3110178fb773e908bd2b03eda.gif" alt=""></span> yielded much better results:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3255" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>Now the question is what to do with these numbers.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved just pumping them into a WAV file and taking a listen. &nbsp;With this setup, all of the negative numbers were negative points on the waveform. &nbsp;Here's the first 400 samples:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png"><img loading="lazy" title="straightwav" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png" alt="" width="937" height="523" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png 937w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-300x167.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-500x279.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px"></a></p>
<p>I took these values, gained them up to fill a 16 bit WAV file and took a listen:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element</audio></p>
<p>Firstly, I was shocked to get anything even closely resembling audio. &nbsp;Especially something so recognizable. &nbsp;That being said, the audio quality isn't the best. &nbsp;The raw values out of the cartridge only extend from around -60 to +60 which leads me to believe that it's encoded as a 7-bit signed integer (-64 to +63). &nbsp;7-bit audio isn't exactly lossless, but I wasn't convinced that this was the best I could do.</p>
<p>I found two problems with the way I was decoding the audio:</p>
<h3>Empty samples</h3>
<p>I noticed looking at the Saleae trace that there were many periods in the 24kHz digital data stream where neither trace showed a blip.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png"><img loading="lazy" title="noblip" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png" alt="" width="1055" height="905" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png 1055w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-300x257.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-1024x878.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-349x300.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></a></p>
<p>Because my script was only looking at the blips, I simply skipped passed these data points. &nbsp;The end result was that the music played slightly faster than it should have. &nbsp;This was obvious when my output WAV file was shorter than my original trace.</p>
<p>I modified the script to detect when more than <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_e8eaa034768987e29c645972e4862a53.gif" alt=""></span> passed between consecutive blips and interpolate blips at the proper places by just repeating the previous value.</p>
<h3>Push Pull simulation</h3>
<p>I noticed later on that I wasn't really simulating the push-pull driver that the Hit Clip likely used. &nbsp;The digital encoding is actually more of a derivative of the output waveform rather than the waveform itself. &nbsp;In other words, a positive value doesn't guarantee that the output will be positive, but rather that it will have a positive slope. &nbsp;A larger value specifies a larger slope.</p>
<p>I modified my script to keep a running value starting from zero where the incoming value from the cartridge is added to the previous value to generate the next one. &nbsp;There was a problem of DC drift because the values don't all add up to zero. &nbsp;My first time through, I found that the largest value was 1 while the smallest value was somewhere around -50,000 which overflowed my signed 16 bit WAV output.</p>
<p>I solved this by …</p></div></div>

<h2>😠 Haters</h2>
<p><em>“Independent Micro-SaaS works with platforms.”<br></em>Some do. But they don’t <strong>depend</strong> on platforms.</p>
<p><em>“What about Medium-SaaS?”</em><br>Don’t take these definitions literally. These are heuristics. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fs.blog/2016/06/value-grey-thinking/" target="_blank">Think grey</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Integrated Micro-SaaS is maintenance hell.”</em><br>There’s no free lunch. The tradeoff is lower platform risk. Independent Micro-SaaS avoids platform risk. <em>And</em> distribution gains from ecosystems. Like <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Shopify's App Store (opens in a new tab)">Shopify’s App Store</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Everything has platform risk.”</em><br>Maybe <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp" target="_blank">systematic risk</a>. Ever-present. It almost isn’t worth talking about. </p>

<p>"Everyone gets the experience. Some get the lesson." T.S. Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to a project is not an easy task, especially if you're new to the project, new to coding in general, or
just not an active contributor.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

The following are benefits I've identified so far.</p><h3 id="heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response">It lessens the need for a client to process the response<a href="#heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>In most situations, we have a client to request the data from the GraphQL server and transform it into the required format.</p><p>For instance, a website on the client-side can process the data with JavaScript, as to transform fields <code>title</code> and <code>date</code> into a description:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> desc <span>=</span> <span><span>`Post </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>title <span>}</span></span><span> was published on </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>date <span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span></span></code></pre><p>However, in some situations we may need to retrieve the data for a service that we do not control, and which does not offer tools to process the results.</p><p>For instance, a newsletter service (such as Mailchimp) may accept to define an endpoint from which to retrieve the data for the newsletter. Whatever data is returned by the endpoint is final; it can't be manipulated before being injected into the newsletter.</p><p>In these situtations, the query could use embeddable fields to manipulate the response into the required format. This could be particularly useful when accessing <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http">GraphQL over HTTP</a>.</p><h3 id="heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema">It can help declutter the schema<a href="#heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The use case above could also be satisfied by adding an extra field <code>Post.descriptionForNewsletter</code> to the schema. But this solution clutters the schema, and embeddable fields could be considered a more elegant solution.</p><h3 id="heading-it-improves-the-development-experience">It improves the development experience<a href="#heading-it-improves-the-development-experience"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields could be compared to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_arrow_function.asp">arrow functions</a> in JavaScript, which is syntactic sugar over a feature already available in the language.</p><p>Arrow functions are not really needed, but they provide benefits:</p><ul><li>they shorten the amount of code needed to achieve something</li><li>they simplify the syntax</li></ul><p>As such, the feature becomes a welcome-to-have in the language, producing a better development experience.</p><h3 id="heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic">The <code>if</code> condition in <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> can become dynamic<a href="#heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Currently, argument <code>"if"</code> for the <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> directives can only be an actual boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) or a variable with the boolean value. This behavior is pretty static.</p><p>Embeddable fields would enable to make this behavior more dynamic, by evaluating the condition on some property from the object itself.</p><p>There is an issue to address: <code>if</code> is a <code>Boolean</code>, not a <code>String</code>, so to avoid type conflicts the GraphQL syntax may also need to accept the embedded field on its own, not wrapping it between string quotes:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>	  id</span><br><span>    title <span>@skip</span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>{</span> hasComments <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Removing the need to wrap <code>{{ }}</code> between quotes <code>" "</code> would solve this issue for every scalar type other than <code>String</code>, not just <code>Boolean</code> (check the example below with <code>droid</code>, using embeddable fields to resolve an <code>ID</code>).</p><h3 id="heading-it-enables-to-code-templates-within-the-graphql-query">It enables to code templates within the GraphQL query<a href="#heading-it-enables-to-code-templates-within-the-graphql-query"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields enable to embed a template within the GraphQL query itself, which would render the GraphQL service more configuration-friendly.</p><p>For instance, combined with the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/174">flat chain syntax</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/252">nested mutations</a> (two other features also proposed for the spec), we could produce the following query, which sends an email to the user notifying that his/her comment was replied to:</p><pre><code><span><span>mutation</span>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This is going to be a painfully cliched, but imagine that the American science and technology system is an engine. It’s just not performing as well as it used to. It’s making a lot of noise and when we push the accelerator it’s sluggish. This bill assumes the solution is STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR HARDER. That is, it wants to slam more money through a system shot through with friction and bad incentives. Slamming on the accelerator when your engine has problems doesn’t often fix the problem. I’ve tried it, and it ended up with my car ‘<a href="https://www.cartalk.com/content/what-does-it-mean-throw-rod#:~:text=The%20motion%20of%20that%20piston,one%20of%20two%20things%20occurs.">throwing a rod</a>.’</p>

<p>Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Congressman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) introduced “The Endless Frontier Act” a bipartisan bill to spend $100B to super-charge the National Science Foundation at the end of May. You can read an official announcement <a href="https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-schumer-unveil-endless-frontier-act-to-bolster-us-tech-leadership-and-combat-china">here</a> and Noah Smith’s summary on Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-01/the-u-s-gets-serious-about-catching-up-to-china-in-r-d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some thoughts after reading through the actual text of the bill. (My eyes will bleed so yours don’t need to.)</p>

<p>This bill is proposing to give money with risk-averse restrictions to a risk-averse organization (the NSF) to be dispersed among other risk-averse organizations (Universities) into a system with increasingly risk-averse incentives.  Note that I’m not saying “it’s all fubar’d lets burn it to the ground!” but I am suggesting that instead of slamming on the accelerator, we should be asking “what would a tune-up and an oil change look like instead? “</p>

<h3 id="the-bill">The Bill</h3>
<p>The bill comes back to its  <code>Key Technology Focus Areas</code> throughout the document:</p>

<p>(i) artificial intelligence and machine learning;
(ii) high performance computing, semiconductors, and advanced computer hardware
(iii) quantum computing and information systems
(iv) robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing
(v) natural or anthropogenic disaster prevention
(vi) advanced communications technology
(vii) biotechnology, genomics, and synthetic biology
(viii) cybersecurity, data storage, and data management technologies;
(ix) advanced energy
(x) materials science, engineering, and exploration relevant to the other key technology focus areas described in this subparagraph.</p>

<p>That list is pretty uncontroversial.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> And that should raise a flag. In other words, this is a list of “what are the top 10 hot technologies right now?” What if there is suddenly a huge opportunity in airship technology? Or underground construction? Or wormholes? It wouldn’t be too much of a problem but this list can only be changed <em>every four years</em>.  You could make the argument that these definitions are so broad that anything could fit in them - ok, then what’s the point of having the list in the first place?</p>

<p>The bill is heavy on bureaucratic requirements and light on science or organizational structure (“we’ll figure that out later.”)  Which reports need to be given to whom and when, how money can and can’t be spent, etc. I agree that this is the job of lawmakers, but it doesn’t feel like opening up an endless frontier, it feels like “here are the walls of your sandbox.”</p>

<p>We are very clear that the grant awards are going to happen on a competitive basis. The bill is shot through with the term <code>award grants, on a competitive basis</code> . This is code for “to get this money, amazing scientist, are going to need to spend a good chunk of your life writing grants” and interacting with websites that look like <a href="https://www.research.gov/research-web/">this.</a> or <a href="https://www.grants.gov/">this</a>.  Competition is good <em>when the output is valuable no matter who wins.</em> Failed grants are basically worthless except as the basis for other grant applications. Economist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XwBP_pqkGJA">Mike Munger does a great job explaining how grants can often end up burning more value than they create</a>.  Months of grant writing is one of the things that makes people think twice about academia.</p>

<p>The bill specifies exactly what the money can be used for <code>may be used for the purchase of equipment, the support of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and the salaries of staff. </code> Like the key areas, this sounds eminently reasonable. However, it means that grant money, unlike normal money, is not fully fungible. You need to track all of it and where it goes in case you are audited. It also means that if the project runs into an expense that doesn’t fall into one of these buckets - say you need a specialized service from a company to do an experiment - you’re stuck. Chilling effects are hard to measure, but my research experience has been shot through with being forced to pay more for an inferior product through a web portal that made your eyes bleed because we had to prioritize “approved vendors” for accounting reasons tied to restrictions like these.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters for this discussion but <code>$20B/year</code> is misleading - the actual bill specifies that the $100B will be backloaded: $2B in 2021, $8B in 2022, $20B in 2023, and $35B in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<h3 id="nstf">NS(T?)F</h3>
<p><code>“I share your feeling about this point,” I said with the fervor of conviction, “but then why not do something about the retardation of scientific progress?”</code></p>

<p><code>“That I would very much like to do,” Mark Gable said, “but how do I go about it?”</code></p>

<p><code>“Well,” I said, “I think that shouldn’t be very difficult. As a matter of fact, I think it would be quite easy. You could set up a foundation, with an annual endowment of thirty million dollars. Research workers in need of funds could apply for grants, if they could make out a convincing case. Have ten committees, each composed of twelve scientists, appointed to pass on these applications. Take the most active scientists out of the laboratory and make them members of these committees. And the very best men in the field should be appointed as chairmen at salaries of fifty thousand dollars each. Also have about twenty prizes of one hundred thousand dollars each for the best scientific papers of the year. This is just about all you would have to do. Your lawyers could easily prepare a charter for the foundation. As a matter of fact, any of the National Science Foundation bills which were introduced in the Seventy-ninth and Eightieth Congresses could perfectly well serve as a model.”</code></p>

<p><code>“I think you had better explain to Mr. Gable why this foundation would in fact retard the progress of science,” said a bespectacled young man sitting at the far end of the table, whose name I didn’t get at the time of introduction. It should be obvious,” I said. “First of all, the best scientists would be removed from their laboratories and kept busy on committees passing on applications for funds. Secondly, the scientific workers in need of funds would concentrate on problems which were considered promising and were pretty certain to lead to publishable results. For a few years there might be a great increase in scientific output; but by going after the obvious, pretty soon science would dry out. Science would become something like a parlor game. Some things would be considered interesting, others not. There would be fashions. Those who followed the fashion would get grants. Those who wouldn’t would not, and pretty soon they would learn to follow the fashion, too.”</code>
From <a href="https://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/619829573132107776/a-short-story-by-martian-physicist-le%C3%B3-szil%C3%A1rd">The Marla Gable Foundation</a> by Nobel Prize winning Physicist Leo Szilard, published in 1948.</p>

<p>The core idea of the bill is to increase the National Science Foundation’s funding and expand its mandate to include technology development as well as science.</p>

<p>Roughly, the National Science Foundation - NSF (and the NIH) decide what to work on by getting some of the ‘top people’ in a field together in a room and asking them “what programs should we pursue?” This process depends first on being able to identify the top people in a field and convincing them to stay in a shitty hotel in Washington. So the agenda is being set by ‘the top people in a field who are willing to come to Washington and stay in a shitty hotel.’ Additionally, who entails the ‘top people’ is up to the program officers and since professors have long term relationships with their NSF program officers, chances are that the professors who have put the work into those relationships are going to be the most salient.</p>

<p>All the incentives are set up so people probably push for their lines of research. Even if they are being completely intellectually honest, researchers probably think that their area of research is the most important thing to fund. If they are slightly less intellectually honest, they realize that they’re more likely to be funded if their priorities line up with the NSF’s.</p>

<p>The process is inherently conservative because if you’re consulting the top people in a field on what to fund, the chances they’ll suggest the weird new thing are low.</p>

<h4 id="but-will-be-like-darpa">But will be like DARPA!</h4>

<p>DARPA has a great track record of enabling paradigm shifting technology - it had its fingers in the creation of personal computing, the internet, modern robotics, gps, and autonomous cars, to name a few. Riffing on DARPA’s model to emulate its success is a worthy goal. However, there is only one section in the entire bill that gives a head nod to the DARPA model:</p>

<p><code>The Director shall have the authority to carry out a program of personnel management authority for the Directorate in the same manner, and subject to the same requirements, as the program of personnel management authority authorized for the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under section 1599h of title 10, United States Code, for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</code>
<code>(B) PROGRAM MANAGERS.—The employees of the Directorate may include program managers for the key technology focus areas, who shall perform a role similar to programs managers employed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the oversight and selection of programs supported by the Directorate. </code></p>

<p>DARPA’s program managers work because they are embedded in an organizational structure and culture that is tuned to empower them to explore high-risk opportunities. DARPA has ~125 staff and three layers of hierarchy while the NSF …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Almost half a year after releasing <a href="https://nico.dorfbrunnen.eu/posts/2020/briar-alpha/">the first alpha release of Briar GTK</a>, today marks the day of its first beta release. Much has happened in the meantime and many people, including me, were able to test Briar GTK and use it in regular occasions. Let’s have a look at how this first beta release looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://nico.dorfbrunnen.eu/images/posts/2020/briar-beta/briar-gtk-screenshot-1.png"><img src="https://nico.dorfbrunnen.eu/images/posts/2020/briar-beta/briar-gtk-screenshot-1.png" alt="Briar GTK in conversation view with two contacts on the left in list and an option to delete the contact"></a></p>
<p>For those not knowing, <a href="https://briar.app/">Briar</a> is a messaging system that keeps information flowing all the time. Whether your internet connection has been cut due to natural disasters or because of governmental censorship, Briar will try its best to get your messages out there to your peers.</p>
<p>As you might already anticipate from the screenshot, it’s now much clearer which messages belong to which author. Additionally, on the left side you can see that Alice is online while Bob is offline. Support for this has landed in earlier alpha releases already. Another huge improvements to Briar’s UX is that you’re now able to copy content from messages. Beside being fully translated to German and Spanish and allowing to delete contacts, this beta release of Briar GTK also offers basic notification support. However, it depends on your desktop environment whether this will work for you.</p>
<p>Note that Briar GTK currently only supports private chats. Support for private groups and forums isn’t yet available in the <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/-/tree/master/briar-headless">Briar Headless API</a> and therefore those features can’t be used in Briar GTK.</p>
<p>Updating to the new version is as easy as calling <code>flatpak update</code> or installing the new .deb files. If you’re new to Briar GTK, you might want to look at its <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-gtk/-/blob/main/README.md#installation">installation instructions</a> to learn how to install it.</p>

Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

Its terrible, and I'd hate to experience what the Kucoin owners would have felt seeing such a large volume go into the ether, but for us cryptocurrency users <a href="https://blockonomi.com/mt-gox-hack/">we've all seen this before</a>.</p><p>The typical security recommendations for holding cryptocurrencies tend to fall on deaf ears, as our human perception for risk management is pretty awful. Especially when you add the time factor on top - with enough time using a cryptocurrency exchange, the more complacent we become with the security of the system. This hack shows just how crucial it is to make sure you take the extra step to hold <em>outside</em> of exchanges, not in them, regardless of how much you trust them.</p><p>The power of cryptocurrency should always remain with the individual - that's why cryptocurrency exists in the first place. There's no need to hand give any power to 3rd parties, except if you need to make specific transactions like selling bitcoin for fiat currency (and even that might be a short-lived requirement with the fast-growing DeFi world).</p><p>We built <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a> to keep the power to yourself, the user. Signata is zero-knowledge when it comes to your cryptocurrency keys - we know we can't provide a guarantee that our service will never be compromised, so we've instead left the control to you. the user. Only you see your private keys, and only you control your crypto assets. We intentionally <strong>do not want to see your private keys </strong>- all that would ultimately achieve is putting a huge target on us.</p><p>Whilst I'm obligated to sell the product I've built to you on this blog, you still don't even need a service like Signata to keep yourself decentralised - <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a> is effectively a simplification of the paper wallet process with the ease-of-use of YubiKeys, but you can totally make <a href="https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/">paper</a> <a href="https://generatepaperwallet.com/ethereum/index.html">wallets</a> yourself, or use offline wallet software, transfer your assets to those, and then move them back into exchanges when you want to (assuming the exchanges will support importing private keys). Just make sure you take the additional steps on top to <em>back up</em> your wallets, otherwise something like a house fire or a failed hard drive could render you totally coinless.</p><blockquote>Note: those paper wallet links above are <strong>not endorsements </strong>of those services - do your own research into creating a paper wallet if you wish to do so, as you need to make sure the website you are using is not taking a copy of the keys that are generated.</blockquote><p>It's up to you as a cryptocurrency user on how much effort you want to take to protect your own assets, but at the very least I impore you to take action to move currency out of the control of exchanges. By all means keep <em>using </em>exchanges - there's no reason not to - but don't <em>hold </em>in exchanges. Hold in services that let you keep ownership of your assets, like <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/portal.jpg" alt="spider"></p><h2 id="preamble-why-are-drivers-still-a-valuable-target">Preamble - Why are drivers still a valuable target?</h2>

<p>Kernels are, no euphemism intended, complex piece of software and the Windows OS is no exception. Being one of the toughest to scrutinize due to its lack of source code and undocumented APIs, it is now being more documented thanks to the immense effort from the research community. Regrettably, during recent times, it has also increased in complexity and its mitigation way improved.
So why attacking drivers? Besides the ones shipped by Microsoft, third-party drivers are the only and more accessible means for third parties to get code execution into ring 0.
Starting from Windows 1607 Anniversary Update, only signed drivers through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/windows-driver-signing-tutorial" target="_blank">WHQL</a> certification process are now allowed to be loaded and, as a consequence of that, crafting and shipping your own bug door is not <del>possibile</del> straightforward anymore.
More information on the whole driver signing process can be found <a href="http://wrogn.com/tag/driver-signing/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this post I would like to cover the “low-hanging fruits”; those hidden and still undiscovered vulnerabilities in signed and trusted production drivers which are, too often than not, widely deployed on consumers and enterprise endpoints.</p>

<p>An exploitable kernel driver vulnerability can lead an unprivileged user to SYSTEM, just because the vulnerable driver is locally available to anyone.
(Well, sometimes the vulnerable driver or kernel component can be owned even remotely - EternalBlue anyone? :)</p>

<p>My goal here is to illustrate a general approach on performing the initial bug analysis through IDA and WinDbg, run a simple fuzzing test and then construct the exploit bottom-up.</p>

<p>The exploit I build is based on <a href="https://www.coresecurity.com/core-labs/advisories/msi-ambient-link-multiple-vulnerabilities" target="_blank">this</a> vulnerability discovered by Lucas Dominikow from CoreSecurity which impacts the MSI Ambient Link driver.
Even though I managed to build a reliable, yet no so elegant, exploit for Windows 7 SP1, our focus we’ll be on Windows 10 only.</p>

<p>These are the two Windows 10 builds I have tested, for both 1709 and 2004 version:</p>

<pre><code>19041.1.amd64fre.vb_release.191206-1406
16299.15.amd64fre.rs3_release.170928-1534
</code></pre>

<p>I have decided not to publish the 2004 version as it’s just almost identical to the 1709 one, apart from the ROP gadgets offsets.
The PoC can be found <a href="https://github.com/uf0o/CVE-2020-17382" target="_blank">on my Github</a></p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-driver">Anatomy of a driver</h2>

<p>In a different words, a driver is nothing but a loadable kernel modules, which means that, unless written to be fully independent, it will require some user land counterpart to interact with.
Before any real funk can commence, the user-mode application has to obtain a valid handle of the driver, which is just a safe way to communicate with ring0.</p>

<h3 id="device-objects">Device Objects</h3>

<p>As we’ll see shortly, the user application calls the <code>CreateFile</code> API to obtain a valid handle.
This function accepts a <em>symbolic link</em> which in our case is a <code>DEVICE_OBJECT</code> element. This <strong>device object</strong> is created by the driver itself as a communication channel available to any user application and, no surprise, it can increase the attack surface if not properly access controlled.</p>

<p>The actual device object is controlled by Windows I/O manager and once a valid request is made, it will return a valid handle to the user-mode application.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/handle2.png" alt="handle">
                                                        <em>Obtaining a driver handle</em></p>

<h3 id="driverentry-and-driver-object">DriverEntry and Driver Object</h3>

<p>The <strong>DriverEntry</strong>, which is present in every driver, is the driver’s entry point. This can be seen as the “main” driver function, similar to the classic <em>main</em> of a user mode application.</p>

<p>The first argument accepted by the <code>DriverEntry</code> function is a <code>DRIVER_OBJECT</code>structure.
This structure, created by the kernel and not entirely initialized, is then passed to the DriverEntry routine.
After loading, the driver can fill in the structure with its own functionalities
The second argument, <code>RegistryPath</code>, is a just a pointer to a string in the Registry where we can pass configuration <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/introduction-to-registry-keys-for-drivers" target="_blank">parameters key</a> to the driver.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>NTSTATUS</span> <span>DriverEntry</span><span>(</span><span>_In_</span> <span>PDRIVER_OBJECT</span> <span>DriverObject</span><span>,</span> <span>_In_</span> <span>PUNICODE_STRING</span> <span>RegistryPath</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the snippet above we can also notice how the <code>DriverEntry</code> routine is responsible for creating the <code>DeviceObject</code> and the symbolic link, which is ultimately provided to the user application in order to communicate with the driver.
Notice the <code>Io</code> prefix of both the APIs used by the driver, <code>IoCreateDevice</code> and <code>IoCreateSymbolicLink</code>, which indicate membership of the I/O Manager realm.</p>

<h3 id="major-functions">Major Functions</h3>

<p>The functions that needs are required to be initialized by the driver are actually called <strong>Dispatch Routines</strong> which is a function pointers array inside the <em>MajorFunction</em> member of the <code>DRIVER_OBJECT</code> structure.
This array depicts which functions the driver supports; a brief list of the most common ones are listed below (more information <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-major-function-codes" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>

<pre><code>IRP_MJ_CREATE (0)
IRP_MJ_CLOSE (2)
IRP_MJ_READ (3)
IRP_MJ_WRITE (4)
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL (14) 
IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL (15) 
IRP_MJ_PNP (31)
IRP_MJ_POWER (22)
</code></pre>

<p>We can view each one of these as a kernel mode counterpart of the user mode standard functions.
For example, <code>IRP_MJ_CREATE</code> is the equivalent of <code>CreateFile</code>, <code>IRP_MJ_CLOSE</code> of <code>CloseFile</code> and so on.</p>

<p>For the sake of our exploitation goals, we will now shift our focus to<code>IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</code> as it’s used as a ‘function dispatcher’ to execute most of the internal driver functionality.
We can notice that each <em>Major Function</em> has a <code>IRP</code> prefix in the name: this is due to the fact that these functions are made for handling different kind of IRPs.
Cool isn’it? but we haven’t mentioned anything about IRP so far, right?</p>

<h3 id="irp-and-ioctls">IRP and IOCTLs</h3>

<p>As we saw earlier, interacting with a driver from user-land code is accomplished though exported DLL functions and the I/O manager, which is the ultimate authority for managing the requests to and from the drivers.
Upon each request, the I/O Manager crafts an I/O request packer (<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp" target="_blank">IRP</a></strong>) that is an <em>opaque</em> structure partially documented on MSDN.
The driver will retrieve the IRP packet addressed to itself, and send it back to the IoManager once done with the routine.</p>

<p>As we saw earlier, once the user mode application obtains a valid driver handle it can start interacting with the driver by sending IRPs, which ultimately contains an IOCTL code that will call a specific driver routine.
The whole process can be simplified as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/flow.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now that we have built some knowledge on driver internals, let’s try to dissect a vulnerable driver and see if we can weaponize it by leveraging a full exploit.</p>

<h2 id="msio64-sys-under-the-microscope">MSIO64.sys under the microscope</h2>

<p>Wearing our new toolbelt we can draw a general approach on what to look for when searching for vulnerabilities in drivers. The following are some points I recommend to check when dealing with them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Driver allows low-privileged users to directly interact with it.</li>
<li>Either <code>MmMapIoSpace</code> or <code>ZwMapViewOfSection</code> are present in the Import Address Table (IAT).</li>
<li>It has some customized <code>memmove</code> or well-known unsafe function</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: this is just a very basic starting point which can be surely expanded above and beyond.</em></p>

<p>To verify the first bullet we should check the driver’s discretionary access control list (DACL) we can use this very handy tool called <a href="https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=97.htm" target="_blank">DeviceTree</a> from OSR.</p>

<p>We just need to search for the correct symbolic link and inspect the <code>DEV</code> tab nested under the <code>DRV</code> one.
From there we have to pop up the <code>Security Attributes</code> window, and check what kind of privileges has the <code>Everyone</code> group.
Good news here: the <code>MsIo</code> device object allows any kind of access between itself and any kind of user, meaning that the driver can be accessed even from a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/mandatory-integrity-contro" target="_blank">low integrity</a> process.
That’s a very good premise to begin with.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/DACL.png" alt="DACL"></p>

<p>I would like to talk about the two critical functions <code>MmMapIoSpace</code> and <code>ZwMapViewOfSection</code>on another occasion, since they are not present in our target driver.
For now, it will suffice to say that they can be used to map kernel memory into a user’s process (and yeah, that can be utterly dangerous)</p>

<p>Next, any function that deals with user mode buffer has to perform bounds checking or else we will incur in a classic buffer overflow, which is the exact same bug that affects <code>MSIO64.sys</code></p>

<h2 id="reversing-and-debugging-the-driver">Reversing and debugging the driver</h2>

<p>Let’s pretend we have no clue about what the advisory is stating, except that we are dealing with a vanilla buffer overflow that will be triggered at some point, after a specific function matches a given IOCTL code.</p>

<p>Before jumping to IOCTLs hunting, we should start analyzing the driver from its very beginning, or in other words the <code>DriverEntry</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/driverentry1.png" alt="driverentry1"></p>

<p>We immediately notice that this preliminary function it just a stub that points to the <code>RealDriverEntry</code> which I renamed aptly.
Let’s jump to that one:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/1.%20IDA%20symbolic%20link%20driver%20string.png" alt="1. IDA symbolic link driver string"></p>

<p>From within <code>RealDriverEntry</code> we can grab the correct symbolic link string, which in our case is <code>\\\Device\\MsIo</code> and note it down. We can also take note of the fifth line where rdi‘s offset is pointing to the <code>DriverObject</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/ida1.png" alt="ida1">
Moving on the next code block, we see that the address of the main function handler <code>sub_113F0</code> is copied into <code>rax</code> which is then referenced by <code>rdi/DriverObject</code> multiple times at different offsets, such as <code>0x68,0x70,0x80,0xE0</code>.
We can get the exact reference by verifying these offsets against the <code>DRIVER OBJECT</code> symbol in WinDBG</p>

<pre><code>0: kd&gt; dt _DRIVER_OBJECT
nt!_DRIVER_OBJECT
...
   +0x068 DriverUnload     : Ptr64     void 
   +0x070 MajorFunction    : [28] Ptr64     long 
</code></pre>

<p>We can already guess that the missing <code>0x80</code> and <code>0xE0</code> values are offsets within the <code>MajorFunction</code> routine itself, along with <code>0x70</code> which will be the first argument.
With <code>0x80</code> being 16 bytes away from the first argument we can then …</p></div></div>

    <div itemprop="articleBody" id="markdown">
      
      <p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/rIQHws2_lQg">recent lang team meeting</a> we discussed
the upcoming
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-core/0.3.5/futures_core/stream/trait.Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a>
RFC. We covered both the steps required to land it, and the steps we'd want
to take after that. One of the things we'd want eventually for streams is:
"async iteration syntax". Just like <code>for x in y</code> works for <code>Iterator</code>, we'd
want something similar to work for <code>Stream</code>. For example JavaScript support
both
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of">sync</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of">async</a>
iteration through <code>for..of</code> loops:</p>
<pre><span>// sync
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>num </span><span>of </span><span>iter</span><span>) {
  console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// async
</span><span>for await </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>event </span><span>of </span><span>emitter</span><span>) {
    console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>);
}
</span></pre>
<p>However when talking about async iteration syntax in Rust one question has
come up repeatedly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should async iteration be parallel or sequential by default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post I'd like to cover the challenges I see with parallel async
iteration, and make the case for, spoilers, defaulting to sequential
iteration semantics.</p>
<hr>
<p>However before we continue, the usual disclaimers: <strong>I'm not on the lang
team. I do not hold any direct decision making power about the Rust language.
I am a member of the Async Foundations WG, but I do not speak for anyone on
the team other than myself.</strong> This post is from my perspective only.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-space">The problem space</h2>
<p>So the core question we're trying to answer is: "should async iteration
default to sequential or parallel?" Putting this into code, it's a question
of what some hypothetical future "async iteration" syntax should compile down
to, and which semantics are provided:</p>
<pre><span>// This code...
</span><span>for</span><span> event.await in channel {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... should it lower into this? (sequential)
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>().await {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... or should it lower into this? (parallel)
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));
</span></pre>
<p>The "lowering" we're describing here is not the <em>precise</em> code we'd expect
the compiler to output. But hopefully it gets the point across. In the
"sequential" case we'd expect async iteration loops to behave much the same
as async <code>while let Some()</code> loops do today. And in the parallel case, we'd
expect something to work with semantics similar to those of
<a href="https://docs.rs/parallel-stream/2.1.1/parallel_stream/">parallel-stream</a>.</p>
<p>The main argument I've heard in favor of parallel async iteration semantics
is that in most cases it's what people want anyway. For example take the
following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream.await? in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Under sequential iteration semantics this loop would process at most 1 TCP
connection at the time, irregardless of system resources available. But under
parallel iteration semantics, this will have access to all resources
available. The idea is that parallel iteration semantics provide a language
level solution to this problem.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-operators">Control flow operators</h2>
<p>The first issue that arises with parallel async iteration is that the <code>break</code>
and <code>continue</code> control flow operators will have different semantics, or need
to be disallowed altogether. Take the following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>// Let's pretend this is valid syntax..
</span><span>for </span><span>(i, stream?).await in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {
    </span><span>if</span><span> i === </span><span>1000 </span><span>{
        </span><span>break</span><span>;
    }
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Say we have a few dozen parallel requests open when we hit <code>break</code>. We should
probably stop accepting new requests. What should happen to the still open
connections?</p>
<p>There is no right answer. We may want to drop them. We may want to keep them
running. More likely the desired behavior may depend on what you're doing.
But the semantics will <em>always</em> be different than in regular for loops
<em>because</em> of parallelism.</p>
<p>Adding new semantics to a well-established concept is tricky, and may
actually lead to subtle translation issues when converting existing
algorithms to async Rust. The safest option will be to disallow these
keywords in this context altogether.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-with-non-async-rust">Consistency with non-async Rust</h2>
<p>We may want to think of "parallel iteration semantics" as something unique to
async Rust, but in fact non-async Rust faces very similar challenges. To
give a very literal example, the TCP example we used earlier would not be
parallelized in non-async Rust as well:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> stream = stream?;
    </span><span>let </span><span>(reader, writer) = &amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>(&amp;stream, &amp;stream);
    io::copy(reader, writer)?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Networking in non-async Rust is not the best match, but for example a data
processing pipeline would be. And if we forget to parallelize at the right
points there, we'll face very similar issues.</p>
<p>The point being: I don't think "parallelism" is a problem unique to async
Rust. And because of that I don't think we should look for a solution that's
specific to async Rust, but instead look for a solution that can be applied
across domains. I think <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2930">RFC
2930 (<code>buf_read</code>)</a> is a great example of an
issue that was found in async Rust, but was determined to apply to non-async
Rust as well, and for which a solution was found that can be applied to both
domains.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-tasks-be-spawned">How would tasks be spawned?</h2>
<p>In order for tasks to be parallelized, they would need to be spawned on a
thread pool somehow. Which means a crucial step in enabling parallel
iteration at the language level is to have a notion of an executor as part of
the language.</p>
<p>C++ is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0761r2.pdf">in the process of
adding</a>
to the language (estimate is C++23), so it's not unthinkable for Rust to do
the same. In fact Boats <a href="https://without.boats/blog/global-executors/">has written about adding a <code>#[global_executor]</code>
before</a>.</p>
<pre><span>// The lowered code from the previous example...
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));

</span><span>// ... would in turn lower into this
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>() {
    task::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{
        dbg!(event);
    });
}
</span></pre>
<p>As you can see we're calling <code>task::spawn</code> for each event. That functionality
would need to come from somewhere, and because async iteration is a language
level concern this would mean that functionality would need to become part of
the language.</p>
<p>I think having a way to perform parallel iteration at the language level is a
<em>great</em> idea. And having a <code>#[global_executor]</code> hook with a default
implementation would solve a lot of issues the ecosystem currently has.</p>
<p>But if history is any indicator this would all take quite a while to shake
out. And I think making async iteration syntax depend on this landing (even
if unstable) would mean it might take a lot longer.</p>
<h2 id="parallelizing-send-streams">Parallelizing !Send streams</h2>
<p>Not all streams are <code>Send</code>, and async iteration should be able to work with
this as well. We can't <em>quite</em> propagate <code>!Send</code> the way we do for async
blocks; the global executor would need to support spawning <code>!Send</code> futures as
well. This is not a major hurdle as for example async-stc provides
<a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/1.6.3/async_std/task/fn.spawn_local.html"><code>spawn_local</code></a>
function. But it's part of the design space to consider.</p>
<h2 id="backpressure-concurency-control">Backpressure &amp; concurency control</h2>
<p>For all its warts something that Node.js streams got right was
<em>backpressure</em>. If for example writing to a file is slower than reading from
a file, the pipeline won't keep reading data if the writer isn't available.
This ensures your RAM doesn't fill up with bytes that are waiting to be written.</p>
<pre><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>');

</span><span>const </span><span>reader </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt</span><span>');
</span><span>const </span><span>compress </span><span>= zlib.</span><span>createGzip</span><span>();
</span><span>const </span><span>writer </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createWriteStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>');

</span><span>reader</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>compress</span><span>).</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>writer</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>In Rust sequential async iteration applies backpressure by default. A
translation of the above Node.js code would be somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> reader = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt</span><span>").await?;
</span><span>let</span><span> writer = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/async-compression/0.3.5/async_compression/stream/struct.GzipEncoder.html#impl-Stream"><code>async-compression</code>'s <code>Stream</code>
types</a>
already work somewhat like this. Because we're performing sequential async
iteration here, reading data from the stream is constrained by the speed at
which we can write. But also vice-versa: the stream is paused if no new data
is available to be read.</p>
<p>If async iteration syntax was parallel by default we would lose backpressure
by default. Which means if no constraints are specified, <strong>by default
parallel async iteration will keep reading data even if there is no consumer
ready to process the data</strong>. Instead limits will always need to be manually
set:</p>
<pre><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>There is a third solution to backpressure we haven't discussed yet: set
<em>some</em> limit by default. Instead of async iteration having unbounded
parallelism by default, we could say, enable <code>1000</code> items by default. This
limit will however almost always be wrong, and really should be set with
knowledge of the workload.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>max throughput</th><th>backpressure?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>sequential</td><td>1</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>bounded</td><td>n</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>unbounded</td><td>unlimited</td><td>no</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="how-common-is-parallel-iteration">How common is parallel iteration?</h2>
<p>A large part of the argument in favor of parallel semantics by default for
async iteration is that it is the most commonly desired semantics. Perhaps
that may be true today within certain domains; but how true do we expect that
to be in the future for across all domains async Rust will cover?</p>
<p>If we want to get a sense of where async Rust might be headed we can take a
look at Node.js streams: they've been around for a decade longer than Rust
streams have. A common kind of stream in the Node.js ecosystem is the
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform">transform
stream</a>: a
stream that takes an input stream and produces an output stream. Take for
example the <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser">csv-parser package</a>: it
takes a stream of CSV text, and produces an output stream of parsed elements:</p>
<pre><span>NAME,AGE
Daffy Duck,24
Bugs Bunny,22
</span></pre><pre><span>const </span><span>csv </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>csv-parser</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>results </span><span>= [];

fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>data.csv</span><span>')
  .</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>csv</span><span>())
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>data</span><span>', (data) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>))
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>end</span><span>', () </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
    console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>);
    </span><span>// [
    //   { NAME: 'Daffy Duck', AGE: '24' },
    //   { NAME: 'Bugs Bunny', AGE: '22' }

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.

It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!

In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network

one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been using Arch Linux since 2016. I got to understand the system better
since then, and installing Arch nowadays is rather a strain on my fingers than
on my brain. I automated my personal setup procedure to some extent with a
couple of shell scripts, which I'm adjusting as time goes and hardware changes.
I collect those scripts and setup instructions in a <a href="https://github.com/patrickbucher/docs/tree/master/arch-setup">GitHub
repo</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I've often taken my laptop with me, especially for
university, I never made the effort to encrypt my disk or a single partition
thereon. Sensitive data, such as passwords, are stored encrypted using GPG. And
my GPG private key is protected with a strong passphrase; so strong, that I
mistype it once in a while.</p>
<p>Having stored SSH keys on my laptop, however, is a risk in terms of data
protection. I do not protect most of my SSH keys with passwords. (<em>Not</em> having
to use passwords is one of the conveniences SSH gives you, after all.) But some
of those SSH keys are gateways to quite some important data, and therefore I
need to re-consider my security practices.</p>
<p>Protecting SSH keys with a passphrase is very inconvenient, especially if you do
a lot of <code>git push</code> operations via SSH. It's possible to use a password
protected SSH key for <code>git</code> only, but having to deal with multiple SSH keys is
inconvenient, too. (My rule is to use one SSH key per client machine.) So
encrypting the hard disk or at least some partitions of it might be the better
solution, because it only requires me to enter an additional password once
during startup, which is once or twice a day.</p>

<p>The Arch wiki provides an article on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">how to encrypt an entire
system</a>.
Such a setup is based on LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), a disk encryption
specification, and dm-crypt, the Linux kernel's device mapper for encrypted
devices.</p>
<p>The wiki mentions different
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Overview">scenarios</a>
for disk encryption. The first option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition">LUKS on a
partition</a>,
is very simple, but not ideal for me, because I'm not just using one giant root
partition, but separate partitions for <code>/var</code>, <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/home</code>. With this
setup, a process filling up my <code>/var/log</code> directory won't prevent me from
writing to <code>/home</code> or the root partition, which might be necessary to deal with
the issue.</p>
<p>One could argue that it's sufficient to just encrypt the <code>/home</code> partition,
which contains the most sensitive data, after all. However, it's possible that
some program logs sensitive data to <code>/var/log</code> or stores it under <code>/opt</code>, so
that an encrypted <code>/home</code> partition won't prevent sensitive data from being
leaked. An unencrypted root partition also makes it possible to tamper
programs, so that data is leaked later.</p>
<p>It's also possible to encrypt the partitions mentioned seperately, which would
require me to enter my password upon booting for every single partition. This is
highly impractical, and therefore I won't do it that way.</p>
<p>The second option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS">LVM on
LUKS</a>,
is a better fit for my purpose. Here, LUKS provides one single block device, on
top of which the encrypted partitions are created. The other, arguably more
sophisticated scenarios, are mostly useful when dealing with multiple disks, or
if an encrypted boot partition is required. So let's stick to scenario two: LVM
on LUKS.</p>

<p>My Lenovo Thinkpad X1 has a SSD with roughly 475 GB and 16 GB memory. This is
important when considering partition sizes. I usually create my partitions as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 256 MB <code>/boot</code> partition for the bootloader (FAT 32).</li>
<li>A 16 GB (the size of my memory) swap partition.</li>
<li>A 128 GB <code>/</code> (root) partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 64 GB <code>/var</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 8 GB <code>/tmp</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>And a <code>/home</code> partition with the remainder of the space, i.e. roughly 260 GB
   in my case (ext4).</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of partition sizes is subject to debate. Some prefer to have a swap
partition with twice the size of the physical memory. Some prefer to make the
root, <code>/var/</code>, and <code>/tmp</code> partitions smaller or bigger. But the above
partitioning scheme was never the cause of any trouble for me, so far.</p>
<p>With those decisions taken, let's proceed to the setup.</p>

<p>So let's go through the setup step by step.</p>
<h2>Prepare the Installation Medium</h2>
<p>First, I download the latest Arch amd64 image via BitTorrent <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:db56a13a6555179990837759ca27274d0be49aca&amp;dn=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso">Magnet
link</a>
from the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">download</a> page and verify its
checksum against the one on the website:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha1sum archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso
95ebacd83098b190e8f30cc28d8c57af0d0088a0
</code></pre>
<p>Then I copy the image on a USB dongle with a capacity of at least 700 MB:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dd if=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M
$ sync
</code></pre>
<p>Then I unplug my USB dongle and plug it into the Thinkpad X1 I'd like to setup,
and boot from it (UEFI boot). Once the installation environment is loaded, let's
continue with the setup.</p>
<p>My Thinkpad X1 has a US keyboard, which I <a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-16-compose-key-on-x.html">prefer to
use</a> nowadays.
However, it's possible to change the keyboard layout as follows (for Swiss
German), if wanted:</p>
<pre><code># loadkeys de_CH-latin1
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I establish a WiFi connection with <code>frzbxpdb5</code> being my network SSID, 
<code>wlan0</code> being my WiFi device, and <code>[topsecret]</code> being my password:</p>
<pre><code># iwctl --passphrase '[topsecret]' station wlan0 connect frzbxpdb5
</code></pre>
<p>Let's continue with the partitioning of the disk.</p>
<h2>Partitioning</h2>
<p>In order to partition the hard disk, one first needs to know the device name,
which can be found using <code>lsblk</code>:</p>
<pre><code># lsblk
</code></pre>
<p>This lists <code>sda</code>, the USB dongle, and <code>nvme0n1</code>, the 475 GB solid state drive
aforementioned.</p>
<h3>Filling the Disk with Junk Data</h3>
<p>As a first step, the disk shall be overwritten with random data.  Even though I
haven't used this laptop productively yet, and so there's no sensitive data
stored on it, it is still a good practice to fill it up once with random data.
This makes it harder for an attacker to distinguish between encrypted data and
random junk.</p>
<pre><code># shred --random-source=/dev/urandom --iterations=1 /dev/nvme0n1
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, using only one single iteration is sufficient. If there was actual
data stored on the disk, multiple iterations should be considered.</p>
<h3>Creating a Boot Partition</h3>
<p>Next, I create a new GPT partition scheme on that disk:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not going to encrypt my boot partition, so I create it as I do for a regular
setup without encryption (as a FAT 32 boot partition, that is):</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart boot fat32 1MiB 257MiB
# parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 set 1 esp on
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
</code></pre>
<p>I leave a gap of 1 MB at the beginning, so no matter what block size my SSD
uses, the boot partition will always be properly aligned. The <code>esp</code> flag
identifies the partition as a UEFI system partition.</p>
<h3>Creating a Partition for Encryption</h3>
<p>Now comes the crucial part. All the encrypted data is put into a single big
partition (<code>nvmen1p2</code>), taking up all of the remaining disk space, which is then
partitioned using a volume manager:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart cryptlvm 257MiB '100%'
</code></pre>
<p>The encryption is set up on this partition:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
</code></pre>
<p>Enter "YES" if asked for confirmation, and pick a strong passphrase to be
entered twice. (At this point, remember exactly which keyboard layout you're
on!).</p>
<p>To further work with the encrypted partition, let's open it, which requires to
enter the password chosen before:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsestup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now a physical volume for the volume mapping needs to be created:</p>
<pre><code># pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>The partitions are going to be managed in a volume group, which I simply call
<code>volgrp</code> for the sake of brevity:</p>
<pre><code># vgcreate volgrp /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now everything is set up to create the remaining, i.e. the encrypted partitions.</p>
<h3>Creating the Remaining Partitions</h3>
<p>Those are created using <code>lvcreate</code> by setting a size (<code>-L</code>/<code>-l</code> parameter) and a
name (<code>-n</code> parameter):</p>
<pre><code># lvcreate -L 16G volgrp -n swap
# lvcreate -L 128G volgrp -n root
# lvcreate -L 64G volgrp -n var
# lvcreate -L 8G volgrp -n tmp
# lvcreate -l '100%FREE' volgrp -n home
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As the user <em>fra-san</em> <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/611421/arch-linux-setup-with-encryption-lvm-on-luks">pointed
out</a>
in a comment on StackExchange, leaving some space open rather than using <code>-l
'100%FREE'</code> for the <code>/home</code> partition is useful when partition sizes should be
increased later.  Shrinking partitions requires to unmount them, whereas growing
them can happen with the affected partition still being mounted. (Check out
<code>lvresize</code> for details.)</p>
<p>The partitions are going to be formatted using the <code>swap</code> and <code>ext4</code> format,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># mkswap /dev/volgrp/swap
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/root
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/var
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/tmp
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/home
</code></pre>
<p>For the actual setup, those partitions (and the <code>/boot</code> partition created
before) need to be mounted to <code>/mnt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># mount /dev/volgrp/root /mnt

# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot

# swapon /dev/volgrp/swap

# mkdir /mnt/var
# mount /dev/volgrp/var /mnt/var

# mkdir /mnt/tmp
# mount /dev/volgrp/tmp /mnt/tmp

# mkdir /mnt/home
# mount /dev/volgrp/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>
<p>Now the partitions are ready for a regular bootstrap installation. (Setting up
the boot loader will require some more specific instructions to disk encryption
later on.)</p>
<h2>Bootstrap Installation</h2>
<p>Now let's install the base system, together with the <code>lvm2</code> package:</p>
<pre><code># pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware lvm2
</code></pre>
<p>In order to get the mounting done automatically upon restart, let's save it in
the <code>fstab</code> file:</p>
<pre><code># genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
</code></pre>
<p>When this is done, let's switch into the installed environment:</p>
<pre><code># arch-chroot /mnt
</code></pre>
<p>A password needs to be set for the <code>root</code> user:</p>
<pre><code># passwd
</code></pre>
<p>In order to have a WiFi connection after rebooting, let's install a couple of
networking packages (some of those specific to my Intel hardware):</p>
<pre><code># pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog intel-ucode netctl dhcpcd
</code></pre>
<p>I set the time zone to Zurich (Europe), update and save the system time:</p>
<pre><code># ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Zurich /etc/localtime
# timedatectl set-ntp true
# hwclock --systohc
</code></pre>
<p>For language and locale, I simply use <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> and <code>en_US-UTF-8 UTF-8</code>,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># echo 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' &gt;&gt; /etc/locale.gen
# locale-gen
# echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' &gt; /etc/locale.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the lack of imagination, I call my laptop simply <em>carbon</em>:</p>
<pre><code># echo carbon &gt; …</code></pre></div></div>

          <p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/">recently announced</a> it was adopting <a href="https://wicg.github.io/sms-one-time-codes/#origin-bound-one-time-codes">a draft standard for the format of SMS one-time passwords</a> (e.g. two-factor authentication codes) to help thwart phishing attacks.</p>
        </div><div>
          <p><strong>SMS Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Before we get to the details it’s important to note that using SMS for one-time passwords is <strong>less secure</strong> than using a dedicated app such as <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> as the approach is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-swap attacks</a>. They’re also l<strong>ess convenient</strong> – sometimes the messages take a while to arrive and won’t be received at all if the user is out of mobile phone range or has swapped their SIM card while traveling overseas.</p>
<p>That said, one-time passwords via SMS matter – they’re the most common way to deliver 2FA codes because they work with the technology that users already have. Downloading a dedicated app just to manage 2FA codes is beyond many users.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind the standard is a predefined SMS (text message) format that looks like this:</p>

          <p>The last line <strong>must </strong>match the format above, starting with <code>@</code> and in the format <code> @origin #code</code>.</p>
<p>Devices can then interpret this as an unambiguous one-time password. On your web app, you specify:</p>

        </figure><p>The browser can match the origin of the site <code>(example.com)</code> against the message received, and then autofill this value for the user.</p><div><figure>

          <p>Some mobile browsers already do this (Safari, for instance) but do so via guesswork and without any guarantee that the one-time password (OTP) you just received belongs to the right site. Without the <code>origin</code>, a phishing site could simply implement the <code>autocomplete="one-time-code"</code> on a bogus site to collect the OTP.</p>
<p><strong>Status of the Standard</strong></p>
<p>This is a draft standard published by Apple and Google earlier this year. Support seems to be growing. <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub adopted it</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;Draft standards can and do change, so make sure to do an up-to-date assessment before you attempt to implement it. (And, if you haven’t already, consider using an identity provider to handle this concern for you. Designing and building secure authentication is hard to do well and often not what differentiates your app.)</p>

  <p>I show how two domain-specific type systems, information flow control and two-party communication protocols, can be implemented in Rust using type-level programming. I explain how interesting properties of these domains can be verified at compile-time. Finally, I construct a general correspondence between type operators, logic programs, and their encoding in Rust.</p>
  <p>Typestate is the concept of encoding state machines in a programming language’s type system. While not specific to Rust, typestate has been <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/08-2-typestate">explored</a> <a href="https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-typestate/">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://blog.systems.ethz.ch/blog/2018/a-hammer-you-can-only-hold-by-the-handle.html">at length</a> in the context of Rust. Typestate boils down to four ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each state is represented as a unique type.</li>
  <li>State transitions are only available as methods for the corresponding state type.</li>
  <li>Taking a state transition returns a state machine of the new state type.</li>
  <li>State transitions invalidate old state.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here’s a state machine for a send-then-receive channel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each state is a unique type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Receiving</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Sending</span><span>;</span>

<span>// The state machine is parameterized by the state</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>chan</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>// Methods for the state are uniquely associated with only the state</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// recv consumes ownership, ensuring old state is invalidated</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>recv</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.chan</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// The state type changes after executing a transition</span>
    <span>(</span><span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.chan</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>);</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[test]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>channel_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>Channel</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>"hi"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
  <span>// and so on</span>
<span>}</span>

  <p>For a discussion about the use of <code>unsafe</code> in this example and the rest of the article, see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gaxlm3/typelevel_programming_in_rust/fp2gjhg/">/r/rust</a> thread.</p>

<p>This pattern works effectively for simple finite state machines, where the logic to determine the next state is straightforward. In this note, I will explore situations where determining the next state is not so simple. In the process, we’ll talk about <strong>type-level programming</strong>, or how you can use Rust’s type system to encode <strong>computations on types</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the goal of this note is to show the value of type-level programming in practice. These same mechanisms have already been used for more esoteric purposes like <a href="https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/">showing Rust’s type system is Turing complete</a>, but I think type-level programming can really help us design better systems!</p>

<h2 id="1-information-flow-control">1. Information flow control</h2>

<p>As a first example, consider a basic information flow control problem. In our program we have low security values (anyone can read them) and high security values (only authorized users can read them).</p>

<p>We represent this idea like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each security level is a type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>

<span>// An Item wraps an arbitrary type T, associating it with a Level</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Constructors for building items of a particular security</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Item</span> <span>{</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>high_sec</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Item</span> <span>{</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// For simplicity, a naked Item can be read by anyone</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Deref</span> <span>for</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Target</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>deref</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.t</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We would like to have a vector of these items with the following property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If all of the items are low security, anyone can read any item.</li>
  <li>If any of the items are high security, only an authorized user can read any item.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, our vector should pass this test:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hi</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>high_sec</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>lo</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is still low sec</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>   <span>// ok to read v</span>

<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>hi</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is now high sec</span>
<span>// assert_eq!(v.get(0), 1); // can't read any more, compiler error</span>

<span>let</span> <span>w</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>::</span><span>login</span><span>();</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>w</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span> <span>// can read after login</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A basic type-state attempt looks like this. We can create and read a low-security vector:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>SecureVec</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can protect a high-security vector through a witness:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// sprinkle some high-security authentication in here...</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>login</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>witness</span><span>:</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, to the main idea: how can we implement <code>push</code>? There are four possible state combinations: a high/low security vector with a high/low security item. While we can implement each combination as a separate method, it’s simpler to consider the underlying logic. <code>push</code> should return a vector of level <code>max(vec_level, item_level)</code> where <code>max(hi, lo) = hi</code>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to encode <code>max</code> as a <em>type-level computation</em>, i.e. an operator on types. The high-level idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traits definitions are function signatures from types to types.</li>
  <li>Trait type parameters represent inputs and associated types represent outputs.</li>
  <li>Trait implementations define individual mappings from inputs to outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are those ideas in action to compute the max security level:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Self (implicitly) is the left operand, Other is the right operand,</span>
<span>// and Output is the output</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Other</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// These impls define the core computation</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// The type alias gives us a more convenient way to "call" the type operator</span>
<span>type</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>L</span> <span>as</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most confusing part is the <code>MaxLevel</code> alias. In brief: <code>L as ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code> says “treat <code>L</code> as the trait object <code>ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code>”. This is necessary since multiple computation traits may have associated <code>Output</code> with <code>L</code>, so the explicit cast disambiguates the <code>MaxLevel</code> computation from the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an example of using the type operator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// type error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can implement <code>SecureVec::push</code> in one method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>push</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>ItemLevel</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>));</span>
      <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the usage of <code>MaxLevel</code> in the return type of <code>push</code>. This is the key use of the type operator as a type-level computation. The other main component is the <code>where</code> clause: when used generically (over any possible <code>ItemLevel</code>), we have to use a trait bound to ensure that <code>ComputeMaxLevel</code> can be “called” on <code>ItemLevel</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent! We’ve now used a type-level computation to more abstractly specify typestate in our information flow control API. Next, we’ll look at an example with a more complex type-level program.</p>

<h2 id="2-two-party-communication-protocols">2. Two-party communication protocols</h2>

<p>When two parties synchronously communicate with each other (e.g. a client and server exchanging information), that communication protocol can be modeled as a session type. We’re going to look at session types <a href="https://munksgaard.me/papers/laumann-munksgaard-larsen.pdf">implemented in Rust</a>. While their full implementation is beyond the scope of the post (see the linked paper or my <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/09-1-session-types">course notes</a>), I will focus on the aspects of session types that showcase type-level programming.</p>

<p>Session types are a domain-specific language of state machines, described by this grammar:</p>



<p>For example, this session type describes a ping server that sends and receives a ping in a loop, exiting on demand. The label/goto scheme uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">de Bruijn indices</a> to locally encode label names as integers.</p>



<p>The grammar, and this example, can be encoded in Rust like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Send</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Close</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The runtime communication API uses the type-state concept as a channel whose type changes as the protocol advances. Initially, a <code>Chan</code> is created for the server and the client (the “dual” of the server). Here’s an example where the type annotations show the change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_ping_server</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>):</span> <span>(</span><span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>PingServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>Dual</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PingServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Chan</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

        <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Recv</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>Ping</span><span>);</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>Ping</span><span>):</span> <span>(</span><span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Goto</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
        <span>c</span><span>.goto</span><span>()</span>
      <span>},</span>

        <span>c</span><span>.close</span><span>();</span>
        <span>return</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the <code>Chan</code> has two type arguments: an environment <code>Env</code> and a current action <code>Sigma</code>. The environment contains a list of session types generated by calls to <code>label</code>. When we <code>goto</code>, we look up the corresponding type in the <code>Env</code> list and make that the type of the current channel.</p>

<p>This is the last post in the series, now we’re going to design an <strong>edge computing platform</strong> using Lua, Nginx, and Redis cluster. Previously, we explained <a href="https://leandromoreira.com/2020/04/19/empowering-nginx-with-lua-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to add code, not dynamically, in nginx</a>.</p>







<p>The platform is meant to provide a way to attach Lua <strong>code dynamically</strong> into the edge servers. The starting point can be to take the authentication code and port it to this solution.</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, we need a Lua <strong>phase name</strong>, an&nbsp;<strong>identifier</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Lua code</strong>. Let’s call this abstraction the&nbsp;<strong>computing unit (CU)</strong>.</p>



<p>If we plan to add a computing unit dynamically to the <a href="https://github.com/leandromoreira/nott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOTT</a>, we need to persist it somewhere. A fast data store for this could be Redis.</p>

<p>We also need to find a way <strong>to encode the computing unit</strong> into some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis data types</a>. What we can do is to use the string to store the computing unit. The key will be the identity and the value will hold the Lua phase and code <strong>separated by the string “</strong>||<strong>“</strong>.</p>

<p>The platform needs to know all of the <strong>computing units</strong>, therefore, we need to <strong>list them</strong>. We could use the&nbsp;<a href="https://redis.io/commands/keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keys command</a> but it can be very slow depending on how much data we have.</p>



<p>A somewhat better solution would be to store all the identities in a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types#sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set data type</a>, providing an <a href="https://redis.io/commands/smembers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O(N) solution</a>, where N is the number of CUs.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>KEYS pattern</strong> would also be O(N) however with N being the total number of keys in the data store.</p></blockquote>

<p>To split a string we’ll use a function taken from Stackoverflow <img src="https://discordemoji.com/assets/emoji/6158_PepeLaugh.png" alt="PepeLaugh - Discord Emoji" width="19" height="19"> and for the <strong>code evaluation</strong>, Lua offers the <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loadstring</a> function.</p>



<p>But now some new questions arise, what happens if the code is <strong>syntactically invalid</strong> or when the <strong>CU </strong>raises an <strong>error</strong>? and how can we <a href="https://www.drdobbs.com/defensive-programming/184401915" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with these issues</a>?</p>

<p>To deal with <strong>syntax errors</strong>, we need to validate the returned values from the function loadstring where the first value is the function instance and the last is the error.</p>



<p>And to <strong>protect against runtime error</strong>, Lua has a builtin function called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/8.5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xpcall</a> (pcall meaning protected call) that receives a function to execute and a second argument which is an error handler function.</p>



<p>With all this in mind, we can <strong>develop the core of our platform</strong>. Somehow we need to get <strong>all the computing units</strong> from Redis, <strong>parse</strong> them to something easier to consume and finally, we can <strong>execute</strong> the given function.</p>



<p><strong>Before</strong> we start to code, we can create a <strong>prototype</strong> that will replicate the authorization token system we did before but now using Redis to add and fetch the computing unit as well as shielding the platform from broken code.</p>

<p><strong>To test</strong> these lines of code, we can go to the terminal and simulate calls to the proper nginx location. Therefore we can understand if the expected behavior is shown.</p>

<p>Since we’re comfortable with our experiment, we can start to <strong>brainstorm</strong> thoughts about the <strong>code design</strong> and <strong>performance trade-offs</strong>.</p>



<h2>Querying Computer Units</h2>



<p>The first decision we can take is about when we’re going to <strong>fetch all</strong> the computing units (<strong>CUs</strong>). For the sake of simplicity, we can gather all the CUs for <strong>every request</strong> but then we’re going <strong>to pay extra latency</strong> for every client’s request.</p>







<p>To overcome these challenges, we’ll rely on two known techniques, &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caching</a></strong> and <strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">background processing</a></strong>.</p>



<p>We’ll move the <strong>fetch</strong> and <strong>parse</strong> logic to run in the <strong>background</strong>. With that running periodically, we then <strong>store</strong> the <strong>CUs</strong> into a <strong>shared memory</strong> where the edge computing core can lookup without the need for additional network connections.</p>



<p>Openresty has a function called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerevery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ngx.timer.every(delay, callback)</a>, it runs a callback function every&nbsp;<strong>delay</strong>&nbsp;seconds in a “light thread” completely detached from the original request. This background job will do the fetch/parser instead of doing so for every request.</p>



<p>Once we got the CUs, we need to find a <strong>buffer</strong> that our fetcher background function will store them for later execution, openresty offers <strong>at least two</strong> ways to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#data-sharing-within-an-nginx-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share data:</a></p>



<ul><li>a declared <a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxshareddict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared memory</a> (lua_shared_dict) with all the Nginx workers</li><li>encapsulate the shared data into a Lua module and use the <strong>require</strong> function to import the module</li></ul>



<p>The nature of the first option&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/blob/master/src/ngx_http_lua_shdict.c#L604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires software locking</a>. To make it scalable, we need to try to avoid this lock contention.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Lua module sharing model also requires some care:</p><p><em>“to <strong>share changeable data</strong> among all the concurrent requests of each Nginx worker, there is <strong>must be no nonblocking I/O</strong> operations (including ngx.sleep) in the middle of the calculations. As long as you <strong>do not give the control back to the Nginx event loop</strong> and ngx_lua’s light thread scheduler (even implicitly), there <strong>can never be any race conditions</strong> in between. “</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#data-sharing-within-an-nginx-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></strong></p></blockquote>



<h2>Edge Computing Bootstrapping</h2>



<p>The usage of this edge computing lua library requires you to <strong>start</strong> the background process and also to explicitly call an <strong>execution</strong> function for each location and lua phase you want to add it to.</p>

                  <li><span color="#333333">We humbly acknowledge that old games 
                    are always better because inventing games is one of two human 
                    activities <i>excluded from progress</i>. The other one is the brain 
                    activity of people who subscribe to that point of view.</span>

                  <li><span color="#333333">We're more committed to strategy games than to tactical ones. 
                    Here's the difference:<br>
                    Strategy games have strategies varied enough to allow different 
                    styles of play, tactics varied enough to induce their own 
                    terminology, and a structure that allows advantageous sub-goals 
                    to be achieved as <em>calculable</em> signposts along the 
                    way.<br>
                    Tactical games have strategies that are either fairly obvious (however deep), 
                    like Pente, or fairly opaque, like Othello.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via AP</p></div><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>CORK, Ireland â€” Facebook has threatened to pack up its toys and go home if European regulators donâ€™t back down and let the social network get its own way.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In a court filing in Dublin, Facebook said that a decision by Irelandâ€™s Data Protection Commission (DPC) would force the company to pull up stakes and leave the 410 million people who use Facebook and photo-sharing service Instagram in the lurch.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>If the decision is upheld, â€œit is not clear to [Facebook] how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,â€� Yvonne Cunnane, who is Facebook Irelandâ€™s head of data protection and associate general counsel, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yngcdv99irbm5sr/Facebook%20DPC%20filing%20Sept%202020-rotated.pdf?dl=0">wrote in a sworn affidavit</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The decision Facebookâ€™s referring to is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v7gkgy/europe-ordered-facebook-to-stop-sending-user-data-to-the-united-states">a preliminary order handed down last month</a> to stop the transfer of data about European customers to servers in the U.S., over concerns about U.S. government surveillance of the data.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebook hit back by filing a lawsuit challenging the Irish DPCâ€™s ban, and in a sworn affidavit filed this week, the company leveled some very serious accusations about the Irish data-protection commissioner, including a lack of fairness and apparent bias in singling out Facebook.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane points out that Facebook was given only three weeks to respond to the decision, a period that is â€œmanifestly inadequate,â€� adding that Facebook wasnâ€™t contacted about the inquiry prior to judgment being handed down.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>She also raises concerns about the decision being made â€œsolelyâ€� by Helen Dixon, Irelandâ€™s data protection commissioner.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThe fact one person is responsible for the entire process is relevant to [Facebookâ€™s] concerns, in respect of the inadequacy of the investigative process engaged in and independence of the ultimate decision-making process,â€� Cunnane wrote.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane also complains that Facebook is being singled out, noting no other big tech company using similar methods to transfer data to the U.S. from the EU is under the same scrutiny.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThis gives rise to an apprehension that [Facebook] is not being treated equally,â€� Cullinane wrote. â€œIf [Facebook] alone is being investigated and subject to a suspension of data transfers to the U.S., this would be liable to create a serious distortion of competition.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The Irish DPC declined to comment to VICE News. Facebook denies that it is trying to force the regulator to change its decision with a threat with withdraw its services.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œFacebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe,â€� a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the court filing simply lays out how â€œFacebook, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A judge last week allowed Facebookâ€™s challenge to go ahead and put a stay on the DPCâ€™s ban on data transfers â€” though the DPC can challenge that decision.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Besides threatening to close down Facebook and Instagram completely, Cunnane also points out that Facebook is an important tool for the freedom of expression of its 410 million EU users â€” it also reportedly generated â‚¬208 billion in sales for companies who use the platforms.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>What she failed to mention, though, is that the service has also been weaponized to sow disinformation and conspiracy theories, as well as being used to influence the results of votes across the region, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cambridge-analytica-leave-eu-ukip-brexit-facebook/">including the U.K.â€™s decision to leave the EU</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebookâ€™s entire business model relies on being able to easily and quickly transfer data across the globe so that it can better target users with ads. By disrupting that flow of data, the EU is threatening Facebookâ€™s revenue potential, and as this lawsuit shows, that is something the company takes very seriously indeed.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But Facebookâ€™s ultimatum is little more than an empty threat, according to privacy experts.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThe idea that Facebook would withdraw from the European market is absurd brinksmanship that I donâ€™t think anyone truly believes,â€� Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London, told VICE News.</p>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue.

September 25, 2020 | https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0"> <div>  <div class="page"> <div id="main-content" role="main">  <p> <span>Updates</span> <span>CMS</span> </p>  <hr> <p>The W3C redesign project is an incredibly exciting one for us at Studio 24, it’s an honour to be working with an organisation we have looked up to for our whole career. But it’s also challenging, with many aspects coming under more scrutiny than we’re normally used to. It’s also made harder in this time of pandemic, with increased anxiety and challenges working effectively during this “new normal” we’re all living in.</p> <p>We’re happy to rise to this challenge. Yesterday a well written article was published by WordPress Tavern on <a href="https://wptavern.com/w3c-drops-wordpress-from-consideration-for-redesign-narrows-cms-shortlist-to-statamic-and-craft">W3C dropping WordPress from consideration</a> which I’d like to respond to.</p> <h2 id="in-context-of-the-project"> <a href="#in-context-of-the-project"></a> In context of the project </h2> <p>We’ve tackled a huge variety of work so far from initial Discovery, User Research, Information Architecture, Content Design and UX Design that has helped move the project forward.</p> <p>The CMS platform decision is just part of this and for the end website is one of the less visible aspects. As you can read from <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/cms-selection-report/">Marie’s report on the work we did to choose Craft CMS</a> you can see the steps we went through to help shortlist and choose a CMS.</p> <p>For us, and the requirements from W3C, the delivery of accessible HTML/CSS pages that meet user needs is the most important part of this project - and where we are focussing our time. All in, we spent around 15 days on the CMS platform choice. Enough to help evaluate a limited number of options, but not enough to do a thorough review of the state of accessibility in a wide range of CMSs.</p> <p>We were surprised by the accessibility issues that cropped up in CMS platforms after our <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/w3c-cms-selection-process-update/">initial CMS review</a>. This prompted us to prioritise accessibility above other requirements due to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#principles">principles and values of W3C</a>.</p> <h2 id="challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"> <a href="#challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"></a> Challenges of Gutenberg (for now) </h2> <p><a href="https://www.studio24.net/">Studio 24</a> is a firm supporter of open source software and we use <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> extensively for our client work. For this project we had committed to not selecting a CMS until we’d had the chance to better understand client requirements.</p> <p>An important consideration for WordPress was accessibility concerns with the new Gutenberg editor. Many have written about the <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/">accessibility issues</a> the project has had as well as the positive <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/whats-new-for-accessibility-in-gutenberg-7-2/">steps to improve accessibility in Gutenberg</a>.</p> <p>Gutenberg is an exciting and really interesting development. Many CMS vendors are looking at ways to allow editors to create more flexible content from compontents or blocks. However, this comes with huge challenges on how to make innovative user interfaces accessible. WordPress decided to use the JavaScript framework <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to meet these needs.</p> <p>We <a href="https://medium.com/studio24/we-tried-converting-a-bespoke-website-design-in-wordpress-with-gutenberg-42e11986b05a">tested Gutenberg</a> six months before it was released in WordPress 5. Recently we worked on a project for the University of Cambridge creating a site for their <a href="https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/">Alumni magazine</a>. This launched in April 2020 and uses Gutenberg to manage content. This gave us a good idea of how Gutenberg works. In June, we reviewed the current accessibility issue backlog (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29">issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/25">a11y project</a>) and had some feedback from users with accessibility needs who had difficulties using the current user interface. This was a contributing factor in our decision that WordPress was not a good fit for this project.</p> <p>Given the importance the WordPress project has put on Gutenberg as the future of WordPress we did not feel it was reasonable to recommend using the Classic Editor if there is a good chance this will not be supported in the future. At present <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/">Classic Editor is slated for end of life in Dec 2021</a>.</p> <p>We look forward to the continued development of Gutenberg and applaud efforts to make it more accessible. We appreciate improvements have been made since our review and we’re very glad to see the <a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/">WordPress Accessibility Day</a> on 2nd October.</p> <h2 id="front-end-complexity"> <a href="#front-end-complexity"></a> Front-end complexity </h2> <p>From a business perspective I also believe Gutenberg creates a complexity issue that makes it challenging for use by many agencies who create custom websites for clients; where we have a need to create lots of bespoke blocks and page elements for individual client projects.</p> <p>The use of React complicates front-end build. We have very talented front-end developers, however, they are not React experts - nor should they need to be. I believe front-end should be built as standards-compliant HTML/CSS with JavaScript used to enrich functionality where necessary and appropriate.</p> <p>As of yet, we have not found a satisfactory (and profitable) way to build custom Gutenberg blocks for commercial projects. We won’t stop trying though and plan to do more R&amp;D with Gutenberg in the future. The W3C project, however, did not feel like the right place to do this. On a project as wide-ranging as this one, development time does become a factor.</p> <p>Drupal also has this complexity issue which makes developing sites harder than it needs to be, and is why we didn’t consider that platform either. I’ve talked to <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/torchbox-has-dropped-drupal/">other agencies who have decided to drop Drupal</a> due to its complexity.</p> <h2 id="the-question-of-open-source"> <a href="#the-question-of-open-source"></a> The question of open source </h2> <p>The W3C embraces and supports the open web. However, as an agency we also have to be practical when it comes to the tools we use to build sites. From our review, which was focussed on PHP-based CMSs, Craft and Statamic came out as meeting all the key requirements and are both very developer-friendly platforms. An important consideration for a tool that we need to hand over to W3C to maintain in the future.</p> <p>While their <a href="https://github.com/craftcms/cms">source code</a> is open, they do have commercial licenses and cost money (though a modest sum). Charging money enables small teams to develop good software, so we’re not ideologically against this business model. Both platforms are well respected in the community and well-used by professionals, running sites such as <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">Big Commerce</a> in Craft, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/">Spiegel Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a> in Statamic.</p> <p>We are using open source technology in the majority of this project (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony). While Craft is a proprietary CMS, this has given us the advantage of direct access to the team developing the CMS which has helped improve accessibility in these CMSs. We hope this helps move accessibility forward in the CMS industry.</p> <p>Open tools will continue to be used to publish the standards of the web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">Technical Reports</a> page is powered by <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> and specifications will continue to be published to <a href="https://github.com/w3c">GitHub</a> to facilitate open discussion. Nothing’s changing with how the W3C work in the open.</p> <h2 id="a-note-on-front-end-delivery"> <a href="#a-note-on-front-end-delivery"></a> A note on front-end delivery </h2> <p>One final note. We are currently considering a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">Headless CMS</a> option for front-end page delivery. This means using the CMS in a decoupled way to manage content but use a separate system to deliver front-end pages. Please note this solution would not be reliant on JavaScript (e.g. a single page app which is common with headless). Under this option we’d use Symfony to deliver front-end pages which is an established technology W3C already use across a lot of the site.</p> <p>This may give W3C better flexibility for the future, though comes at a cost of added complexity. The W3C site is already made up of a lot of different systems, the CMS is just one part of the what makes up the varied content on <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a>.</p> <p>I hope this helps explain the thought process behind our decision a little more and addresses some of the valid concerns highlighted in the WordPress Tavern post.</p> <hr>  </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

<blockquote><p>Go also happens to have a (rather insane, in my opinion) policy of
reinventing its own standard library, so it does not use any of the
standard Linux glibc code to call vDSO, but rather rolls its own calls
(and syscalls too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordinary non-C languages on Unixes generally implement a great many
low level operations by calling into the standard C library. This
starts with things like making system calls, but also includes
operations such as <code>getaddrinfo(3)</code>. Go doesn't do this; it implements
as much as possible itself, going straight down to direct system
calls in assembly language. Occasionally there are problems that
ensue.</p>

<p>A few Unixes explicitly say that the standard C library is the
stable API and point of interface with the system; one example is
Solaris (and now Illumos). Although they don't casually change the
low level system call implementation, as far as I know Illumos
officially reserves the right to change all of their actual system
calls around, breaking any user space code that isn't dynamically
linked to <code>libc</code>. If your code breaks, it's your fault; Illumos
told you that dynamic linking to <code>libc</code> is the official API.</p>

<p>Other Unixes simply do this tacitly and by accretion. For example,
on any Unix using <code>nsswitch.conf</code>, it's very difficult to always
get the same results for operations like <code>getaddrinfo()</code> without
going through the standard C library, because these may use arbitrary
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdResolvedNotes">strange</a> dynamically loaded
modules that are accessed through <code>libc</code> and require various random
<code>libc</code> APIs to work. This points out one of the problems here; once
you start (indirectly) calling random bits of the <code>libc</code> API, they
may quite reasonably make assumptions about the runtime environment
that they're operating in. How to set up a limited standard C library
runtime environment is generally not documented; instead the official
view is generally 'let the standard C library runtime code start
your <code>main()</code> function'.</p>

<p>I'm not at all sure that all of this requirement and entanglement
with the standard C library and its implicit runtime environment
is a good thing. The standard C library's runtime environment is
designed for C, and it generally contains a tangled skein of
assumptions about how things work. Forcing all other languages to
fit themselves into these undocumented constraints is clearly
confining, and the standard C library generally isn't designed to
be a transparent API; in fact, at least GNU libc deliberately
manipulates what it does under the hood to be more useful to C
programs. Whether these manipulations are useful or desired for
your non-C language is an open question, but the GNU libc people
aren't necessarily going to even document them.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://marcan.st/2017/12/debugging-an-evil-go-runtime-bug/">Marcan's story</a> shows
that the standard C library behavior would have been a problem for
any language environment that attempted to use minimal stacks while
calling into 'libc', here in the form of a kernel vDSO that's
designed to be called through libc. This also shows another aspect
of the problem, in that as far as I know how much stack space you
must provide when calling the standard C library is generally not
documented. It's just assumed that you will have 'enough', whatever
that is. C code will; people who are trying to roll their own
coroutines and thread environment, maybe not.)</p>

<p>This implicit assumption has a long history in Unix. Many Unixes
have only really documented their system calls in the form of the
standard C library interface to them, quietly eliding the distinction
between the kernel API to user space and the standard C library API
to C programs. If you're lucky, you can dig up some documentation
on how to make raw system calls and what things those raw system
calls return in unusual cases like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SocketReturnAPIDesign"><code>pipe(2)</code></a>.
I don't think very many Unixes have ever tried to explicitly and
fully document the kernel API separately from the standard C library
API, especially once you get into cases like <code>ioctl()</code> (where there
are often C macros and <code>#define</code>s that are used to form some of the
arguments, which are of course only 'documented' in the C header
files).</p>

    <p>The Maersk Triple-E Class container ship is 1,300 feet long, carries over 18,000 containers across 11,000 miles between Europe and Asia, and… Its entire crew can fit inside a passenger van.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e84e2eff3c5307ee69a77b3313684a5a90aa0981/d7909/images/uploads/maersk-container-ship.jpg" alt="Maersk container ship"></p>

<p>As a former naval architect and a current <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/">marketing consultant to startups</a>, I found that the same principle that lets a 13-person crew navigate the world’s largest container ship to a port halfway around the world without breaking down also applies to startups working towards aggressive growth goals:</p>

<p><strong>Simple systems have less downtime.</strong></p>

<p>Ships contain simple systems that are easy to operate and easy to understand, which makes them easy to fix, which means they have less downtime. An important quality, considering that “downtime” for a ship could mean being stranded thousands of miles from help.</p>

<p>Take the ship’s steering system, for instance. The rudder is pushed left or right by metal rods. Those rods are moved by hydraulic pressure. That pressure is controlled by a hydraulic pump. That pump is controlled by an electronic signal from the wheelhouse. That signal is controlled by the autopilot. It doesn’t require a rocket scientist or a naval architect to find the cause of and solution to any problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the autopilot fails, steer the ship manually from the wheelhouse.</li>
  <li>If the electronic signals fail, go to the rudder control room to control the pump by hand, while talking with the bridge through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-powered_telephone">simple sound-powered phone</a>.</li>
  <li>If the hydraulics fail, use the mechanically linked emergency steering wheel.</li>
  <li>If the mechanical linkage fails, hook a chain to both sides of the rudder and pull in the direction you want!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4676c41bcb0133d35827e62d044f82c9511ffd21/bb56a/images/uploads/174.jpg" alt="Cartoon about redundancy"></p>

<p>Startups, like ships, can’t afford to stall from system downtimes. Extended downtime in sales, marketing, web, customer support, hiring, product, and other systems may cause irreparable damage to the growth rate.</p>

<p>(Although automation is prevalent on modern ships, it only affects the time it takes to do things and the attention required to monitor everything. The propulsion and auxiliary systems are more simple than ever, thanks to modern diesel and electric propulsion systems that replaced pipe-laden steam plants.)</p>

<h2 id="why-simplicity-leads-to-less-downtime">Why Simplicity Leads to Less Downtime</h2>

<h3 id="1-proficiency-takes-less-time">1. Proficiency takes less time.</h3>

<p>If the person responsible for the system leaves, falls overboard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">gets hit by a bus</a>, or gets pulled into another project, another person can take over without much learning or training. That means more people are able to step in to troubleshoot and fix issues.</p>

<p>For example, an analytics dashboard built with Tableau is likely to have more qualified people to fix it than one built with a patchwork of custom scripts and APIs. Nobody should have to pull data scientists or product developers away from their work to fix a bar chart.</p>

<h3 id="2-troubleshooting-takes-less-time">2. Troubleshooting takes less time.</h3>

<p>In a system where the behavior of each component and its relationship to other comments is easily understood, ruling out issues and finding the broken component—the root cause—is more intuitive.</p>

<p>For example, if a company has many downloadable whitepapers on their website, and they’re all gated behind a single form—as opposed to a custom form for each one—then they need only troubleshoot one form and one automation workflow if the whitepaper downloads stop working.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/495bdd177c0618760025c9d94dcfc8129aa117f5/ec606/images/uploads/91.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a ship being stuck in Nebraska"></p>

<h3 id="3-more-alternative-solutions">3. More alternative solutions.</h3>

<p>When each part of the system has a clear function, alternatives are easier to find.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a Salesforce process that uses a mishmash of automation and third-party tools to score, filter, classify, and assign new sales leads. If that fails then there is no obvious replacement. Everything will be put on hold until the process is fixed or replaced with a similarly complex solution.</p>

<p>Now imagine a sales process in which the sales team is simply notified of each new sales lead along with pertinent details, letting them decide whether or not to follow up with the lead. If the Salesforce notification step fails, it’s easy to come up with a hundred other ways of getting that information to the sales team: Reports, Slack notifications, list exports, manual observation, or using Zapier to send an alert through virtually any medium. The downtime would last a few minutes, at most.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/26ba2a1619df8df60c6a56e3ec07a7b81478f644/75961/images/uploads/77.jpg" alt="Cartoon about boats grounding because of a broken lighthouse"></p>

<h2 id="startup-story">Startup Story</h2>

<p>One of my clients was using a legacy enterprise marketing automation platform (Marketo) with 629 automated processes built up over several years. When something broke or needed tweaking, there was only one person among the 150+ employees who could do it. Each issue took several days or even weeks to fix, all the while marketing campaigns stalled. And with each patch, the overall system only grew more complex.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c25f453aa08d83e439b8d4ad5240ea4842ff286f/421d6/images/uploads/127.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a sailor coming home drunk"></p>

<p>When that person left the company, there was nobody left to operate the system. With every passing week a new issue would come up, faster than we could find and fix them.</p>

<p>To keep the marketing operation from coming to a standstill, I rushed to migrate the company from Marketo to HubSpot, a more simple platform that would be easier to operate and troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The migration took just one week. Along the way, however, another complex system reared its head: Salesforce. There were 10 automated processes in Salesforce with over 100 combined operations, all dependent on various delicately timed automations in Marketo. It took two weeks—twice as long as the migration—to understand and integrate those processes with the new marketing platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/169a7904b8e2c26fd693968dbb2250d75eba25f3/7e08a/images/uploads/193.jpg" alt="Cartoon about being stranded on an island"></p>

<p>Overall, these two complex systems (in Marketo and in Salesforce) resulted in six weeks of downtime for the marketing team and three weeks of downtime for the sales team. That’s not counting the many weeks of downtime they experienced throughout the past few years, nor the many weeks of downtime they would experience in the future if we did not overhaul the underlying systems.</p>

<p>In the end, the system I put in place had 97% fewer processes (from 629 to 20) while providing all the same capabilities. A bug that was found a few days later got resolved in four minutes.</p>

<p>This experience made me wonder what principles startups can adopt to avoid the pitfalls of complex systems.</p>

<h2 id="principles-for-simple-systems">Principles for Simple Systems</h2>

<p>Rip-and-replace projects are painful and disruptive, even when the long-term benefits are worth it. Many startups—as with ships—don’t have the luxury of time and resources to perform overhauls once they’re underway.</p>

<p>Here are my three principles to follow when evaluating or implementing new systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Features don’t justify complexity.</strong> What good is a complicated flight control system if it grounds an entire fleet of aircraft, or an enterprise marketing platform like Marketo if nobody can run a marketing campaign? Choose tools that are simple to operate over those that promise the most features. A frequent recommendation I give to startups is to choose HubSpot for their marketing platform instead of an enterprise platform like Marketo, Eloqua, or Pardot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complex ideas lead to complex implementations.</strong> If it takes too long to explain or grasp an idea, then its implementation will be complex, and it will take too long to fix when something inevitably breaks. For example, a proposed sales process that requires an hour-long presentation will be a nightmare to maintain, regardless of how clever it seems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modifications before additions.</strong> When new requirements come up, the tendency is to add layers on top of the existing system—by way of additional steps or integrations. Instead, see if the system’s core can be modified to meet the new requirements. The change may cause (planned) downtime upfront, as with my Marketo-to-HubSpot migration example, but less (unplanned) downtime over the long term.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“… the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered.” — Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no question things will break along the startup journey, just as surely as they do on a ship crossing the globe. However, if the onboard systems are simple, those issues won’t leave the startup drifting helplessly in the middle of the ocean.</p>

		<p>Owned and run by <strong>Kevin Beynon</strong>, its goal is to balance the monopolistic platforms of Amazon, Google, and Apple, with a service that is designed NOT to be tied to its own bookshop or e-reader (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration" target="_blank">vertically-integrated</a>). In effect, supporting independent bookshops, publishers, and self-publishing authors, by providing readers with the same book management tools they would normally only get from big companies.</p>
		
		<h2>Why I built Libreture</h2>
		<p><strong>I'm an avid e-book reader and was once a Kindle-owner. After news of Amazon's UK tax-avoidance broke I decided to boycott them and look for alternative e-bookshops.</strong></p>

		<p>I concentrated on finding bookshops that sold DRM-free e-books, to ensure I could read them on any device. I also wanted to support small and independent publishers and bookshops. With this in mind, I compiled a list of <a href="https://www.libreture.com/bookshops">DRM-free bookshops</a>. The list is still growing and is now a key component of Libreture - readers record where they bought their DRM-free books, helping others discover new bookshops.</p>

		<p>A big part of Amazon's service is its book storage and management tools. To avoid these, I began using <em>Shelfari</em>, a library management website. Shelfari was a great tool, but in 2008, the owners <a href="http://shelfari.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/08/shelfari-joins-the-amazoncom-family.html" target="_blank">sold Shelfari to Amazon</a>. So I moved to <em>Goodreads</em>.</p>

		<p>When the owners of Goodreads also <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family" target="_blank">sold their business to Amazon</a> in 2013, I had finally had enough. Many others felt the same way.</p>

		<blockquote>"What terrible news. Loss of an independent reader community, now another channel for the faceless machine to leech reader data to withhold from suffering publishers &amp; booksellers. If through this account Amazon has a record of my reading habits I will be deleting the account. Very sad."<br>
		<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family#comment_70824525" target="_blank">Laura - 28/03/2013</a>
		</blockquote>

		<p>At that point I began building my own stable platform to store e-books, record reading activity, and promote DRM-free bookshops and publishers.</p>
		<p>I built the first version myself, and for myself. It soon became clear that others may find it useful too. Working with an external development company, we re-built Libreture from scratch.</p> 
		<p><strong><a href="https://www.libreture.com/blog/libreture-open-business/" target="_blank">Libreture launched to the public in March, 2017</a></strong></p>
		<p><strong>So far, readers are storing 8,069 e-books with Libreture.</strong></p>
		
		


		<h2>Price</h2>
		<p><strong>You can use Libreture absolutely free to store a limited amount of e-books, and you can upgrade to a paid plan to store much, much more.</strong></p>
		<p>Libreture doesn't offer a discounted annual rate that only saves money for those that can afford to pay up front. The fee is set for each plan and covers the cost of development, infrastructure, storage for your books, as well as a small profit margin. I believe each plan is as reasonable as possible while keeping Libreture sustainable (which means keeping me in tea and biscuits).</p>
		<p>Free and Paid plans ensure that costs are covered as soon as they happen, such as when readers upload large book collections. It also gives you the flexibility to switch plans to whatever suits you, or cancel whenever you want and only pay for the remainder of the month.</p>
		<p>The paid plans also exist to ensure that you, the reader, are always the most important part of Libreture. No advertising, no selling data, and no sellouts. It's just you, Libreture, and loads and loads of great books.</p>
		
		<h3>Tax</h3>
		<p><strong>I believe that tax is the price we pay for a civilised society.</strong></p>
		<p>Since I am a sole-trader and Libreture is not a limited company, I cannot become <a href="https://fairtaxmark.net/" target="_blank">Fair Tax Mark</a> accredited. But I have pledged to follow the guidelines laid down in the <a href="http://www.fairtaxpledge.uk/" target="_blank">Fair Tax Pledge</a>. While not legally binding in any way, I think it's a good indicator of an individual's commitment to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law when it comes to taxes.</p>
		<p><img src="https://www.libreture.com/static/images/FTP_cyan-small.png" alt="Fair Tax Pledge logo."></p>
		<p>More information about the Fair Tax Pledge:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Its aim is to help those people who believe in a fair society and playing by the rules to say so publicly; and in the process, to send a powerful message to those who cheat the system.</p>
			<p>It is designed for use by individual citizens and sole traders and produced by the Fair Tax Mark, the organisation behind the label for good taxpaying companies, but is an entirely distinct and separate project.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Privacy</h2>
		<p><strong>Data privacy is extremely important to me.</strong></p>
		<p>What you read says a lot about you. That's why Libreture reader's book collections, or libraries, are <strong>private by default</strong>. Members must actively choose make their library public before anyone else can see them.</p>
		<p>Even if they make their entire library public, members can still make individual books private. These books never appear publicly, regardless of the reader's library-wide setting.</p>
		<p>Readers don't even need to provide their real name when joining Libreture. An <em>avatar</em> is optional and is stored on Libreture. Details are stored in the UK.</p>

Downsizing the multi-boot image</h2>

<p>If the multi-boot image doesn't fit your 8GiB uSD card, because it's&nbsp;a tad
too big, you can downsize it a bit by using this script:</p>

<pre><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set -e -x</span>

<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> m
L<span>=</span><span>`losetup -P --show -f multi.img`</span>
mount <span>-o</span> <span>compress</span><span>-force</span><span>=</span>zstd <span>${L}</span>p2 m
btrfs filesystem resize <span>7000</span>M m
<span>echo</span> <span>",7000M"</span> <span>|</span> sfdisk <span>-N</span> <span>2</span> <span>${L}</span>
umount m
losetup <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>$L</span><span>"</span>

truncate <span>-s</span> <span>$((128+7000)</span><span>)</span>M multi.img
</pre>

<p>If something fails in the middle, you may need to recover by calling
<code>umount</code> and <code>losetup -d</code> yourself.
<code>losetup -l</code> can tell you if the image is still exported as a loop
device, and which&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>The image will have the size of 7128&nbsp;MiB after resize and this should fit
more „8“ giga something uSD cards, as there are obviously some other giga
units than gigabyte and gigibyte used by some manufacturers.</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-20-some-ways-to-improve-pinephone-safety">2020–09–20:
Some ways to improve Pinephone safety</h2>

<p>This is a follow up on some issues from the previous article. On surface,
solutions to some of the previously presented issues can seem simple. Toggle a
few registers in PMIC, and we're mostly done. Trouble is that safety mechanisms
are barely ever triggered, by definition. Safety events occur rarely. That means
that the mechanisms are not regularly tested, and it is not known that
they&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>Also it's&nbsp;not clear which code's&nbsp;responsibility fixing the issues should
be. Bootloader, or kernel, or userspace? Finally, there are a bunch of devils in
the details, that complicate the upstreamability of any solution. And having
fixes upstream is necessary to make sure they reach the most&nbsp;users.</p>

<h3 id="toc-necessary-minimum">Necessary minimum</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, at least enabling some pre-existing PMIC functionality blindly
is better than nothing, so that's&nbsp;precisely what I&nbsp;decided to do <a href="https://megous.com/git/p-boot/commit/?id=db73ff85c60944207b7f7368e554003494148a05">in
p-boot</a>. It's&nbsp;the easiest place to start resolving these issues for me
personally, and for other p-boot&nbsp;users.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;fixed two issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&nbsp;enabled the battery temperature monitoring and charging regulation based
	on temperature thresholds defined in the Pinephone battery specification.</li>

	<li>I&nbsp;enabled emergency shutdown when crossing the critical temperature
	of&nbsp;PMIC.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&nbsp;didn't measure the 3kOhm NTC used in Pinephone battery and third party
batteries I&nbsp;bought. I&nbsp;just used a table from some random 3kOhm NTC spec on The
Internet, that seemed like it could match. Hopefully it's&nbsp;close enough.</p>

<p>Trouble with the second fix is that it's&nbsp;a hard power cut-off, so data loss
may occur when PMIC overheats. There are three fixed temperature levels in
AXP803. On level 1&nbsp;the charging is limited, on level 2&nbsp;the interrupt is sent
to SoC, on level 3&nbsp;the PMIC shuts down if configured to do so (by default it
keeps running, and this is what my p-boot fix changes). Ideally, the crossing of
level 2&nbsp;would be handled by Linux to make it safely shut down the system, and
level 3&nbsp;forced power cut-off would never happen. Arguably, if charging was
source of the heating, crossing level 1&nbsp;will lead to resolving the issue, so
the next level will not be reached.</p>

<h3 id="toc-suggested-fixes-elsewhere">Suggested fixes elsewhere</h3>

<p>These fixes will reach a very limited audience. It would be nice to have
these fixes in U-Boot too, but that's&nbsp;not possible at the moment, because
U-Boot doesn't have access to&nbsp;PMIC.</p>

<p>Other places to put the fix is to ATF or Linux kernel. That can reach more
people faster, but there would have to be some generic mechanism to make the fix
upstreamable, otherwise it will not reach people using the mainline Linux kernel
or mainline&nbsp;ATF.</p>

<p>There are some ways to approach this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use battery description in DT from <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">ATF</a> to set up
	thresholds in PMIC (ATF has access to&nbsp;PMIC).</li>

	<li>Use battery description in DT from Linux's&nbsp;battery charger driver for
	AXP803 to set up thresholds in PMIC and stop disabling temperature
	monitoring.</li>

	<li>Use <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/charger-manager.txt">charger
	manager</a> in Linux, but that looks like it's&nbsp;a completely software solution,
	that will be inferior to PMIC handling the regulation. And it seems it would not
	work in system suspend, anyway, because Linux is not running&nbsp;then.</li>

	<li>Detect Pinephone compatible string in either ATF or Linux and set up the
	thresholds to ad-hoc values for 3kOhm NTC. (easiest, unlikely to be acceptable
	upstream)</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the most generic solution would be to have a description of the
battery in DT describing the Pinephone. Sadly, the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9-rc5/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/battery.yaml">current
bindings</a> don't include battery temperature limits.</p>

<p>Also converting from temperature to NTC resistance (which is necessary to
determine the code word from ADC for the limits used by the temperature monitor
logic in PMIC) is not straightforward. It is usually defined in NTC datasheet as
a table. Do I&nbsp;have NTC datasheet? No. I&nbsp;bought the batteries online from some
mobile phone service&nbsp;shop.</p>

<p>There are also equations that approximate the temperature&nbsp;– resistance
relationship for the NTC, which could be used instead of a fixed table, if one
knows the relevant coefficients. These can be calculated after measuring the
NTC's&nbsp;resistance at a few temperature points when we lack the datasheet.</p>

<p>So generic solution may look like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>DT contains battery temperature limits from the battery&nbsp;spec</li>

	<li>DT contains NTC coefficients (perhaps also on the battery&nbsp;node)</li>

	<li>some routine would use all this info from DT to calculate code words used by
	AXP803 ADC and program them to PMIC (either in ATF, or&nbsp;Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kernel also has support for NTC devices, so maybe NTC can be described
outside of the battery node (even though it's&nbsp;part of the battery).</p>

<p>This may all fail to be upstreamed on one thing: the battery is user
swappable, so it's&nbsp;arguably not part of the Pinephone, and describing it inside
the pinephone DT will not be appropriate.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;don't have any plans implementing any of the above, atm. Maybe with the
exception of adding a 4th approach to the fix to my Linux kernel (the easiest
one ;)). I'd like to work on my multi-boot image. So these are mostly pointers
for somebody else who'd like to tackle&nbsp;this.</p>

<h3 id="toc-other-issues">Other issues</h3>

<p>Fast charging is not necesary in many situations, so having it as a default
is not great. User should be able to decide if he wants to trade off slower,
safer charging and battery longetivity over speed. This tradeoff can be realized
in many&nbsp;ways.</p>

<p>All this is already controllable from userspace via sysfs. Ideally there
would be some charging monitoring daemon that would take into account
users's&nbsp;wishes and select proper strategy for charging, based on preference for
battery longetivity or&nbsp;speed.</p>

<p>There are several trade offs the deamon would be able to handle:</p>

<ul>
	<li>0.2C charging all the way (slow, but safer)</li>

	<li>0.5C charging to 40% and 0.2C charging to 100% (middle ground)</li>

	<li>0.5C charging all the way to 100%</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is decision making that doesn't belong to the kernel.</p>

<p>Similar daemon could monitor power usage of the phone and try to limit it to
safer levels, or warn the user if that's&nbsp;not possible.</p>

Let's&nbsp;talk about safety of Pinephone</h2>

<p>My gf read me some articles about exploding phones today. :) I&nbsp;think there
needs to be some serious conversation about Pinephone safety. Safety needs to
become an important concern now, when more and more people are getting their
Pinephones every month. It's&nbsp;just a matter of time before the first major
safety incident hits this community, and it may be more than just a hacked
store. It's&nbsp;just a numbers&nbsp;game.</p>

<p>Pinephone is an interesting device in one way. You can run whatever software
you like on it (and you do!), and this software comes almost universally with
<strong>zero</strong> guarantees. Read the license to any of the program you run
on your Pinephone and it will almost certainly tell&nbsp;you:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
	WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt; AS IS AND ANY EXPRESS
	OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO
	EVENT SHALL &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt; BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
	INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
	ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
	FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
	details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>In case of Pinephone you have to take these warnings <strong>very
seriously</strong>, because this software is not provided by the manufacturer
(Pine64), and as far as I&nbsp;know, there's&nbsp;no software related safety testing
going on at&nbsp;all.</p>

<h3 id="toc-some-skeletons-hiding-at-the-lower-levels">Some skeletons, hiding at
the lower levels…</h3>

<p>I'll give you a few reasons why things may not be so rosy, when it comes to
safety.</p>

<p>There's&nbsp;no unchangeable well tested guardian angel management engine that
safely manages battery, power supplies, thermal behavior, that is provided by
the manufacturer, and that is independent of the operating system.</p>

<p>Pinephone's&nbsp;SoC is quite bare when it comes to software/firmware
(that's&nbsp;why FOSS enthusiasts like it, no blobs, you know!). This has a dark</p></article></div>

		<p>KansasFest 2019 presentation, “Ready Player Two”</p>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3Qj0vnZx7Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>One of the first games I ever played on my family’s Apple IIe was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)">Jordan Mechner master work, Karateka</a>. Fight the bad guys, save the princess – it’s a simple but classic formula. My brother and I would take turns making our way through Akuma’s fortress. Even then, we wanted a two player version.</p>
<p>Fast forward more than 30 years, and I’ve taught myself 6502 assembly after getting back into the Apple II, through the thriving community online. The idea of a two player version of Karateka came back to me while at <a href="http://kansasfest.org/">KansasFest</a> a couple of years ago. I noodled a little on it back then, getting distracted by finding the code that created the <a href="https://github.com/option8/ksynth">unique music</a> in the game.</p>
<p>Long story short: I finally found the places in the game code that needed patching to allow a second player to control the enemies in the game, and create a functioning two player version of Karateka. The resulting patch is only 42 bytes long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/karateka-two-player">A DSK image is downloadable and playable online at the Internet Archive.</a></p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 20, 2018]:</strong> Some people seem to think I had access to the Karateka source code to make my edits. As far as I know, that source code is unreleased, still in Jordan Mechner’s archives somewhere. Instead, I fired up the game in my Apple II emulator of choice, <a href="http://virtualii.com/">Virtual ][</a>&nbsp;and froze the game state. Stepping through instructions, I followed the assembly as it built up each frame of animation, triggered events and eventually found where the player and enemy performed their attacks. By comparing memory states from before and after the enemy attacks, I found a handful of zero-page variables that, when I changed them manually, would trigger a punch or kick.</p>
<p>From there, it was a matter of finding the routines that read and wrote to those memory locations, and inserting my own code to listen instead for the keyboard to trigger each action.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 23, 2018]:</strong> Robin Harbron has ported the two-player patch over to the Commodore 64 port of Karateka. <a href="http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271">You can read Robin’s write-up here:&nbsp;http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271</a></p>
<p>Digging a little deeper than my original patches, Robin added the ability for the second player to move backward as well as forward. I’ll have to back-port that to my version.</p>

<h3>Player 1 controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Q,A,Z to punch</li>
<li>W,S,X to kick</li>
<li>C,V to move/run</li>
<li>SPACE to go from standing to fighting stance and back.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Player 2 controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>N to kick</li>
<li>M to punch</li>
<li>&lt; to move left</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnCRkPLoXXzTtWX9dBJsnA">Chris Torrence</a>, for helping spelunk the game’s memory layout; to <a href="https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/">Antoine Vignau</a> for his clean DSK crack and a patch to skip the intro and get right into fighting; <a href="https://twitter.com/a2_4am">4AM</a>&nbsp;for inspiration and helping test.</p>
<h3>Patch Details:</h3>
<p>Addresses are locations in memory after the game finishes loading.</p>
<p>Before the enemy fighter punches, code loads the Accumulator with D7 then jumps to $6540. A kick is similar, but loads A with C5. I patched those pieces at $6C11 (punch) and $6C20 (kick) instead to read the keyboard buffer and load the appropriate byte into the Accumulator. Otherwise, it goes along to $6540 with 00, which does nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6C11: D0 1C C5 21 D0 18 A9 00 85 29 A9 D7 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CD D0 02 A9 D7 8D 10 C0 (M to punch, clears strobe)</li>
<li>$6C20: 20 95 6C C5 D7 B0 08 20 71 6C A9 C5 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CE D0 02 A9 C5 8D 10 C0&nbsp; (N to kick, clears strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Code at $6B9B seems to check if the distance between fighters ($33) is too far, trigger the enemy to move closer. This happens with a JMP to 6C52. I read the keyboard ($C000) and check for the comma/less-than.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>$6B9B: A6 33 E0 0C 90 03 4C 52 6C E0 07 B0 02 -&gt; AD 00 C0 EA EA EA C9 AC D0 03 4C 52 6C&nbsp; (&lt;&nbsp; to move player 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to check the keyboard while the game is usually busy animating the enemy fighter, I had to find where the keyboard strobe ($C010) was cleared, and NOP it. This happens several places in the main loop, but patching at $6EA9 kept the keyboard buffer long enough for me to check it.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6EA9: 8D 10 C0 -&gt; EA EA EA (keep from clearing keyboard strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the second player controls were working, I modified the first player controls so both players could huddle around the keyboard and not cross over each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6e8e: 88 -&gt; C3 (C to move left instead of ctrl-H/left arrow)</li>
<li>$6e98: 95 -&gt; D6 (V to move right instead of ctrl-U/right arrow)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: Now defaults to keyboard controls without having to hit K at the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>$b9a8: A5 C4 D0 00 -&gt; A9 01 85 C4 (default to keyboard control, ignores joystick)</li>
</ul>

This is one of those emails with some adjustments for sharing publicly. </p><p>Let me be honest right off the bat; this won’t be one of those “coding rules! anyone who doesn’t code shouldn’t be listened to!” cult pieces. Quite the contrary.</p><p>There is something deeply satisfying about creating things that solve a problem -any problem- in a better way. I mean there’s something deeply satisfying about creating things period. I don’t know exactly what it is -and we can argue forever about the existential anxiety roots of craving problem solving as a form of meaning for life- but it’s definitely there. I personally find building technology that simplifies complex problems or streamlines unnecessarily convoluted processes to be the most satisfying flavor of that.</p><p>That’s why despite not having a lot of savings (long story), having a 1 Million dollar job at my hands (thus finally comfort and building “wealth”) and against the advice of everyone I know (well except my brother) I decided it’s time to build computer science skills. To code.</p><h2>The backstory</h2><p>I started out my career on the “business” side of things on the other side of the world (America being “this side”). Landed a couple of decent -and excruciatingly boring- corporate jobs at Fortune 500 companies’ local offices for a couple of years before I quit without a plan. I had to. If I had stayed one more day I would have walked into the office and started banging my head against a wall screaming “None of us has a real job” on repeat. I kept applying to jobs I thought at the time would be intellectually challenging and that can be a gateway to get me into the “technology space” in America (more on why later). By some whiff of good luck I got into management consulting at its most sought after name; McKinsey. A couple of years later I transferred to their New York office, started a full-time MBA at Columbia and was well on my way to do what I wanted to do. A few years after that I had founded a -failed- startup, advised on some very interesting technology &amp; strategy topics (when I went back to McKinsey) and worked at a leadership role at a dream company of mine; Amazon. I was super lucky.</p><p>Until October 2019 I had a great job at Amazon. I led a big team doing product management, marketplace growth &amp; data science for one of the e-commerce businesses. It had been 3 years in that role during which the business grew ~800% into multi-billion dollars of revenue which was super exciting. I loved my team, my boss and the company culture. We built things many people wanted. In short, many real -not vanity- metrics were checked for me. In addition, my Amazon stock compensation had skyrocketed in value so I was making great money.</p><p>Ironically, I started getting the “walk in and bang my head against the wall” urge again. This time I knew what the issue was though so I made a plan. In fact I had known one of the issues for quite a long time but the time to act on it hadn’t come -for many personal reasons- until now.</p><p>While I was finalizing that plan -it involved quitting the large corporate world at least for a while- a headhunter reached out about a very senior role at a Fortune 100. After some back and forth, I agreed to talk because “there’s nothing to lose and it would be good networking anyway”. They quickly made me an offer. Self delusion kicked in.</p><p>The three delusion flavors of that week were: 1. “You can’t pass on landing a C-level job at a Fortune 100 in your damn 30s! Remember where you started!” 2. “You can still build stuff. After all they are a technology company -albeit old school- and you’ll lead a turn-around there” and the world champion of delusions: 3. “I’ll do this for a couple of years then I can do my plan and take all the risk I want”.</p><p>Long story short, I took the offer and put my plan on hold.</p><p>This job was very different from my previous jobs which have all been in either tech (Amazon &amp; the startup I founded and ran for a few years out of New York) or management consulting (McKinsey). It was much more “cushy”, focused a lot more on corporate politics and was not as intellectually challenging. My compensation would have added up to more than $1 Million per year, I was leading a large organization with hundreds of people, etc. It <strong>checked a lot of “vanity metrics”.</strong> <strong>None of that matters and never should. </strong>Misery often comes out of comfort without purpose.</p><p><strong>8 weeks into this new cushy job I quit (most of the comp is in equity that vests over time so I didn’t make much of those big bucks 🤷🏻‍♂️) to go back to what I had originally intended to do.</strong> It sounds crazy because of the opportunity cost but that is actually sort of the point.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600965088871_5937"><div><h3>The why: Florence</h3><p>I immigrated to the US 10 years ago because I wanted to be part of building technology that solves problems and -as naive or cliche as this sounds I don’t care- builds the future. There are many many other reasons to love America but “technology &amp; entrepreneurship paradise” was the main one for me. I moved my entire life for that despite having a flourishing career that would have been even much more financially lucrative -if you think short to medium term- elsewhere (for starters I would have paid literally zero taxes the last 10 years while making very similar money 😂). For someone who did not grow up rich by any stretch of the word this was not an easy string of decisions.</p><p>Here’s how I found myself describing it to a close friend who’s in very similar shoes a while back: “I’m not entirely sure why but I feel like we have a role in Florence during the renaissance. It’s almost impossible to put a price on that”</p><p>Back to that “plan” that this post is all about. As I sat down to think about what I want to do towards the end of my time at Amazon I followed a simple framework:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_7975"><div><p>I had known for a long time that if I want to truly build things that make a dent in some problems (i.e. #2 on the list above) I need to learn how to code properly. After all <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is -truly- eating the world</a>. But it quickly hit me how interconnected the answers to all 4 questions are. <strong>Layering skills</strong> that help you <strong>become a builder</strong> of things and <strong>taking the risks that come with that</strong> in the process are (or lack thereof) the answer to all 4 questions.</p><p>A couple of years ago I watched Marc Andreessen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8QHeAv4_XE&amp;t=1442s" target="_blank">talk</a> about the best career advice he heard. He heard it from the creator of Dilbert; Scott Adams (who wrote it <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html" target="_blank">here</a>). Layering and combining skills. I can’t overstate how much I think this is spot on. If you’re a business person who knows data science you can accomplish 10x more than any other business person. If you’re an engineer who understands business &amp; customers you can be 10x more effective than any other engineer. Etc.</p><p>I layered quite a bit of “business” skills over the years. Yet all these things fall under what I call the Business Generalist umbrella (I wrote about this <a href="https://rightalot.com/blog/2020519-the-generalist-dilemma" target="_blank">here</a>). I believe that in order to make meaningful contributions to solving hard problems in technology you need some level of participation in computer science (actually it could be participation in any kind of physics and engineering). Being able to build (hence coding) yourself not just manage others to do so vastly expands your ability to experiment, spot good ideas, develop stronger intuition and most importantly it makes you have skin in the game (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075HYVP7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Nassim Taleb</a>).</p><p>I dabble in coding (although I am far from a professional developer) and when I do -for work or fun- it doesn’t feel like work most of the time. It feels like a hobby. Like you’re actually rolling up your sleeves and <strong>making</strong> the idea in your head. I also never felt like I’m working while I worked on small teams with people I really like that are solving something with a missionary rather than a mercenary mindset. It was definitely the case when I started my own company where a team of 5 survived for 2 years on just $200K of funding because we all were focused on building. But I’ve had this experience in other situations too.</p><p>The things I’d regret the most (work-wise) when I’m 80 are risks I did not take. And as -Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ" target="_blank">puts it</a>- minimizing regret is something I believe many of us should aim for. The only real risk is taking no risks. Failure isn’t the worst outcome. Mediocrity is.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>I just got into <a href="http://www.lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> and I haven’t been this excited about something in a long time. I chose Lambda over other programs including a Masters in CS for many reasons but the main one was simply that they have what I believe to be the best approach. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_11960"><div><p>I’ll be writing a separate post on the quest for how to study CS properly and why I think Lambda is the best option.</p><p>I’m going full in. I’m starting Lambda full-time to build CS skills, I’m talking with a few small teams about ideas and I am starting to put all what I’ve learned about business skills into online courses/newsletter. My first goals are finishing Lambda School with a skillset that enables me to build products and to build a side part-time profitable business that enables me to have the peace of mind to continue experimenting with big ideas.</p><p>I tweet<a href="http://twitter.com/byadham" target="_blank"> @byadham</a>&nbsp;. You can follow me there as I document what I learned from my previous journey and what I’m learning from what I’m doing now. </p><blockquote><p>There’s an Arabic saying attributed to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran">&nbsp;Khalil Gibran</a>; the brilliant author of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_%28book%29">&nbsp;The Prophet</a>&nbsp;that roughly translates to: “For they should learn that the rich man is not who owns more but who needs less”.</p></blockquote><p>Cheers</p></div></div></div>]]>

Since this knowledge is scarce, a hidden problem is trying to <em>find </em>the people who have this knowledge.

      &nbsp;</span>
      </td><td>
      	<p><span size="2" face="Arial">The advances described are 
		the result of my research carried on for many years with the chief 
		object of transmitting electrical energy to great distances.&nbsp; The first 
		important practical realization of these efforts was the alternating 
		current power system now in universal use.&nbsp; I then turned my attention to 
		wireless transmission and was fortunate enough to achieve similar 
		success in this fruitful field, my discoveries and inventions being 
		employed throughout the world.&nbsp; In the course of this work, I mastered 
		the technique of high potentials sufficiently for enabling me to 
		construct and operate, in 1899, a wireless transmitter developing up to 
		twenty million volts.&nbsp; Some time before I contemplated the possibility of 
		transmitting such high tension currents over a narrow beam of radiant 
		energy ionizing the air and rendering it, in measure, conductive.&nbsp; After 
		preliminary laboratory experiments, I made tests on a large scale with 
		the transmitter referred to and a beam of ultra-violet rays of great 
		energy in an attempt to conduct the current to the high rarefied strata 
		of the air and thus create an auroral such as might be utilized for 
		illumination, especially of oceans at night.&nbsp; I found that there was some 
		virtue in the principal but the results did not justify the hope of 
		important practical applications although, some years later, several 
		inventors claimed to have produced a "death ray" in this manner.&nbsp; While 
		the published reports to this effect were entirely unfounded, I believe 
		that with the new transmitter to be built, this and many other wonders 
		will be achieved.&nbsp; Much time was devoted by me to the transmission of 
		radiant energy, in various forms, by reflectors and I perfected means 
		for increasing enormously the intensity of the effects, but was baffled 
		in all my efforts to materially reduce dispersion and became fully 
		convinced that this handicap could only be overcome by conveying the 
		power through the medium of small particles projected, at prodigious 
		velocity, from the transmitter.&nbsp; Electro-static repulsion was the only 
		means to this end and apparatus of stupendous force would have to be 
		developed, but granted that sufficient speed and energy could be 
		realized with a single row of minute bodies then there would be no 
		dispersion whatever even at great distance.&nbsp; Since the cross section of 
		the carriers might be reduced to almost microscopic dimensions an 
		immense concentration of energy, irrespective of distance, could be 
		attained.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">When I undertook to carry out this plan in practice, the difficulties 
		seemed insurmountable.&nbsp; In the first place, a closed vacuum tube 
		could not be employed as no window could withstand the force of the 
		impact.&nbsp; This made it absolutely necessary to project the particles 
		in free air which meant that each could hold only an insignificant 
		charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, no matter how high the potential of the 
		terminal, the force of repulsion would be necessarily too small for the 
		purpose contemplated. . . . But by the application of my discoveries and 
		inventions it is possible to increase the force of repulsion more than a 
		million times and what was heretofore impossible, is rendered easy of 
		accomplishment.&nbsp; The successful carrying out of the plan involves a number of more or 
		less important improvements but the principal among these include the 
		following:</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">1. A new form of high vacuum tube open to the atmosphere.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">2. Provisions for imparting to a minute particle an extremely high 
		charge.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">3. A new terminal of relatively small dimensions and enormous potential.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">4. An electro-static generator on a new principle and of very great 
		power.</span></p>

		cemented to a metallic socket 3, and an outer conduit 2, which is 
		tightly screwed to the socket by a nut 4, and has on the open side a 
		taper with a cylindrical end 9, of the same inside diameter as conduit 
		1.&nbsp; The socket 3, is bored out to provide a large chamber around the 
		inner conduit and carries a pipe 7, through which thoroughly desiccated 
		air or other gas under suitable pressure is supplied.&nbsp; The open end of 
		the inner and the tapering part of the outer conduit are ground to form 
		an expanding nozzle 8, through which the air escapes into the atmosphere 
		thereby creating a high vacuum in the inner conduit.&nbsp; The socket 3 has a 
		small central hole and is provided with an inside extension 5, and a 
		threaded outside projection 6, the latter serving for connection to a 
		container supplying automatically suitable particles or material for 
		same while the former fulfill the purpose of charging them as they 
		emerge from the hole.&nbsp; The conduit 1 and 2, may be made of fused quartz, pyrex glass or other refractory material and it is obviously desirable 
		that all the parts of the apparatus have small and nearly equal 
		coefficients of thermal expansion especially when the working medium, 
		which might also be superheated steam,<br>
		is at an elevated temperature.</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">It will be observed that in this tube I do away with the solid wall or 
		window indispensable in all types heretofore employed, producing the 
		high vacuum required and preventing the inrush of the air by a gaseous 
		jet of high velocity.&nbsp; Evidently, to secure this result, the dynamic 
		pressure of the jet must be at least equal to the external static 
		pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">Expressed in symbols:</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">V<sup>2</sup>w/2g = P</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">Assuming equality:</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">V = √2g P/w</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">in which equation V is the 
		speed of the jet at its entrance to channel 8 in meters, g the 
		acceleration of gravity likewise in meters, P the external pressure in 
		kilograms per square meter and w the normal weight of the air in 
		kilograms per cubic meter.&nbsp; Now</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">g = 9.81 meters</span></p>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">P = 10332.9 kilograms</span></p>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">w = 1.2929 kilograms</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">These values give</span></p>

			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">V = 396 meters</span></p>

		</blockquote>

		<img src="http://www.teslaradio.com/images/teleforce_fig_2-500.jpg" width="500" height="296"></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">Some allowance should be made for the frictional loss in the nozzle and 
		the outlet channel and also for the deflection of the jet.&nbsp; For most 
		purposes, the velocity need not be much greater, but as the degree of 
		rarefaction depends on the square of V, it is desirable to obtain as 
		high a value as practicable.&nbsp; Usually, vacuums obtained by a mercury 
		vapor pump are considered very high.&nbsp; In those, the velocity is only 280 
		meters per second but the vapor is 6.9 times heavier than air.&nbsp; Therefore 
		to get the same vacuum in the air jet, its speed should be 280 x 
		[6.9]1/2 = 735 meters.&nbsp; With a working medium at high temperature and 
		pressure, both within practicable limits, this value can be attained and 
		even exceeded.&nbsp; Thus, a gaseous jet of very high velocity affords a means 
		for closing the end of the tube, more perfectly than any window that can 
		be made while at the same time permitting and facilitating the exit of 
		the particles.&nbsp; Referring to fig. 2., it shows schematically a modified form of my tube 
		intended for various scientific and practical uses when it may be 
		preferable or necessary not to discharge the jet through the open end.&nbsp; The construction of the device will be easily understood in view of the 
		foregoing description like parts being similarly designated.&nbsp; A 
		cylindrical conduit 1, is provided as in fig. 1, but the outer cone is 
		replaced by a block 2, of lava or other insulating material shaped as 
		indicated and firmly cemented to the conduit 1, which is hermetically 
		joined by a nut 4, to a metallic plug 3, having a central hole, and 
		extensions 3 and 6, serving the purpose stated above.&nbsp; The working fluid, 
		as compressed desiccated air, is supplied by means of a pipe 7, to a 
		large annular space around conduit 1, and escapes through an expanding 
		nozzle 8, formed by the tapering part of the block and the end of the 
		conduit, into a chamber connected by a pipe 10, to a vacuum pump of 
		large capacity - not shown on the drawing - for carrying off not only 
		the air issuing from the nozzle but also that rushing in from the 
		outside through the open end 9.&nbsp; In order to minimize the volume of the 
		latter, I avail myself of an invention of mine known as the "valvular 
		conduit" by providing the wall of the open end 9, with recesses as 
		indicated giving rise to whirls and eddies which use up some of the 
		energy of the stream and reduce its velocity.&nbsp; In this way, a pressure of 
		about 100 millimeters of mercury can be readily maintained in the 
		chamber increasing greatly the expansion ration of the air and its speed 
		through the nozzle.</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">It is hardly necessary to remark that my open vacuum tubes require 
		mechanical power for operation which may range from 10 to 20 h.p., but 
		this drawback is insignificant when considering the important advantages 
		they offer and I anticipate that they will be extensively employed.</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">It remains to be explained how such a tube is utilized for imparting to 
		a particle to be projected a very great charge.&nbsp; Imagine that the small 
		spherical body be placed in a nearly perfect vacuum and electrically 
		connected to the large sphere forming the high potential terminal of the 
		transmitter.&nbsp; By virtue of the connection, the small sphere will then be 
		at the potential of the large one no matter what its distance from the 
		same but the quantity of electricity stored on the small sphere will 
		vary greatly with the distance and be proportionate to the difference of 
		its potential and that of the adjacent medium.&nbsp; If the small sphere is 
		very close to the large one, this …</span></p></td></div></div>

			<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514OQW-WXvL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="A Pocket Guide To CHINA: Including Milton Caniff Cartoon Strip: Milton Caniff, Various members Special Services Division, US Army: Amazon.com: Books" width="463" height="571"></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/hgp/id/681">Pocket Guide to China</a></strong> is a 64 page primer for American soldiers stationed in China during World War II written by unknown personnel of the Special Service Division of the Army Service Forces of the United States Army. The text offers insights into Chinese behavior, cultural values, food, cleanliness, social structure, military capabilities, and everything else an intrepid American spending years in the deep interior of a foreign land might need to know. The Guide is a charming time capsule of old-school liberalism, propaganda, and clunky-yet-earnest cultural tolerance, and while it’s too short for me to write a deep dive, I couldn’t help but do a quick write-up about it.</p>

<p>Much of the text is what you’d expect from a 1940s sociological analysis. There’s a lot of just-so generalizations which are probably good heuristics for behavior, but you can never quite tell if any particular advice is well-grounded, or just the vague sense of one random guy. For instance:</p>
<p>(I find it helps if you read all these quotes in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRp2u8d7lrg">old-timey newscaster voice</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“Realize in advance that the Chinese, friendly and spontaneous and natural as they are, have a few special likes and dislikes. They do not like to be touched. They don’t like to be slapped on the back, or even to shake hands, although some of the modern ones have learned this form of salutation. So don’t put your hands on anybody, in fun or fury or affection, until you know the person very well indeed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You may want to buy something to take home to the girl friend. It is customary for the shopkeeper to ask considerably more than an article is worth. If you pay what is asked, he will not respect you for it. If you argue him down too much, he would prefer not to sell to you at all. If you pay about half to two-thirds what he asks, he will admire you and enjoy the transaction. But above all keep good humored throughout. In China it is a sign of bad breeding to grow heated over a purchase whether it is made successfully or not.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Having spent quite a bit of time in China myself, it’s also hilarious how accurate some advice still is:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is usually wise, in personal dealings with a Chinese helper or assistant, to give him a problem and let him handle it in his own way. However, make sure that he understands you. You will rarely hear a Chinese say “I don’t know” when you ask him a question. “Yes” is a stock answer and this can make for no little confusion if you don’t watch out. But if you explain carefully and protect his self-respect you won’t have any trouble.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the potential over-generalizations, it’s all well-intentioned. For a random American soldier who had never been to Canada, let alone Asia, he could do a lot worse than following these guidelines when starting a multi-year stint in inland China.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yr3LeQd.png" alt="PHOTOS: American G.I.s' 'A Pocket Guide to China' circa 1943 is comedy gold – Thatsmags.com" width="701" height="428"></p>
<p>More importantly, the Guide tries to promote cooperation between Americans and their distant allies in the Orient. Thus the central paradigm of the Guide is that though Chinese people do lots of odd things, and look nothing like us, and know nothing about us… that doesn’t matter. We’re all on the same team.</p>
<blockquote><p>“…you have to show the Chinese that Americans treat the Chinese as we treat any of our allies, and that we respect them as human beings on an equality with ourselves. Sure, there are differences. So what? There are similarities too. If you forget the differences and think of them as neighbors, as people who eat, sleep, work, and raise families as we do, you’ll be over the first hurdle.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Discourage anyone who acts as though the Chinese are queer. They are not queer. After all, there are more people in the world eating Chinese food and wearing Chinese clothes than there are eating American food and wearing American clothes. They live their way and we live ours. If you respect them, they will respect you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s especially emphasized that as strange as Chinese people may seem in so many different ways, they’re just like us on what really matters:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Of all the peoples of Asia, the Chinese are most like Americans. Those who know both people often remark at their likeness. One of the reasons, perhaps, is that we both live in countries where there is plenty of space and a great variety of climate and food. We are alike, too, because we both love independence and individual freedom.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious subtext of a lot of these sections is that though the Guide itself preaches tolerance and charity toward our distant allies, the Guide authors are definitely expecting the average American soldier to be weirded out by the Chinese and automatically fall back on racism. But the Guide valiantly fights against that for moral, logical, and strategic reasons:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you think of the Chinese as a yellow-skinned people of a totally different race from us, you probably will never get to know them. What’s more, you’ll be playing right into the hands of Hitler and the Japs. Japan will harp on about the color question first, last, and all the time. She will tell the Chinese what she has been telling them ever since Pearl Harbor – that Americans look down on non-white peoples and that the Chinese can never hope to be treated on terms of equality by America. ‘Why fight for the white man?’ Japan dins into Chinese ears.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Those [Chinese] you saw in America may have come from one small part in China – the city of Canton. Judging all Chinese by those who live in one small part of the country is like judging all Americans by the residents of Hoboken, New Jersey.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I found it pretty remarkable how wise and uplifting much of the Guide is. There are some legitimately great passages about showing charity to radically different ideas and searching for common values with a people not easily understood. It’s not what you’d expect from a sociological analysis written in the 1940s.</p>
<p>But… it’s still a sociological analysis written in the 1940s:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Another likeness is that we are both humorous people. The Chinese love a joke just as well as we do, and they laugh at the same sort of thing. Their stock jokes are the same as ours – about professors, and doctors, and Irishmen – the Chinese equivalent for the Irish being people from Hunan province.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though it’s 64 pages long, the <strong>Pocket Guide to China</strong> is a short read (30+ minutes) and I recommend that anyone with an interest in China, the Asian front of WW2, or pre-civil rights era views on race and culture check it out. You can read the whole thing at this <a href="https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/hgp/id/681">link</a>.</p>

<p>This was a feature Apple prototyped but never shipped that was near and dear to my heart. The feature addressed two things.</p>



<p>First, people often remember the app they used to create a document or when they worked on it last. It’s harder to remember the name of the document or where they put it. I see people freeze up when the OS asks them where to file something and what to name it. I think this is still a great shortcoming in macOS.</p>



<p>In addition, there’s the question of why does it matter what the name or location of a file is? Why waste time naming and filing things away if you can find it because you remember you created it in MS Word yesterday?</p>



<p>Secondly, when it came to minimized windows, especially those minimized into the application icon—a feature that still exists today—I saw that people would perceive those windows as lost.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn’t seem quite as powerful as it should until you imagine that you are chatting in Messages and you want to open a Preview document. A click and hold gets you access to all open documents without leaving the context of Messages.</p>

<p>If you chose that option, you would see an arranged view of all the open windows for the application as well as minimized windows. Here are some variations on that theme.</p>







<h3>Recents</h3>



<p>Finally, there was a token effort to look at recents and here is the only screenshot I could find. Unfortunately, it’s very small. The idea is click-and-hold on any document-based application icon would show open windows and recently opened documents.</p>



<p>I think this was a far superior experience to opening an app and being dumped in a folder that may or may not contain the document you want. It may have documents going back years (yes you can sort them if you in the right view.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>I worked on a lot of great features that shipped that I’m proud of. But, the agony of seeing something die that you loved can be very painful.</p>



<p>On the positive side, sometimes bits and pieces or even a completely reimagined version of something you love sees the light of day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos-Mesh-1.0 - Chaos-Engineering-on-Kubernetes-Made-Easier" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-mesh-1.0-22c3415bc75bde8501087d6c7c154cd5.png"></p><p>Today, we are proud to announce the general availability of Chaos Mesh® 1.0, following its entry into CNCF as a <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/announcing-chaos-mesh-as-a-cncf-sandbox-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sandbox project</a> in July, 2020.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 is a major milestone in the project’s development. After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

<p>"Everyone gets the experience. Some get the lesson." T.S. Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to a project is not an easy task, especially if you're new to the project, new to coding in general, or
just not an active contributor.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

September 25, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/calculus-in-saas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/calculus-in-saas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a>‍</p><p>I have been studying the SaaS model in depth for almost 7 years now. Since the day <a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/p/harry-2d5d1af6bf">Harry Weller</a> walked into my office with a stack of materials and told me to study it and then SaaS build models and bring them to portfolio companies, I don't think a day has gone by where I have not thought about the conceptual and operational nuances of the recurring revenue business model.</p><p>Somewhere around mid 2015 I had my "aha" moment in my research when I tied my academic training in mechanical engineering to the startup business models I was building: it's all calculus. The integral-derivative relationship applies incredibly well to the ARR and Recognized Revenue relationship. Making this connection between engineering math and financial math gave me a feeling that only a true nerd could appreciate: the joy of putting integral symbols and accounting terms on the same slide.</p><p>The simplest way to illustrate this mathematical parallel is with a car:</p><figure id="w-node-2abd43418357-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b33c9e3271323643b3d_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F42d5ef92-52d9-49fe-8be7-16028bee1ff4_884x306.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If a car is moving at 60mph, then in one hour it will travel 60 miles (assuming its speed does not change). That is the definition of "miles per hour." ARR is very similar: if a company is "moving" at $10M ARR, then in one year it will recognize $10M of revenue (assuming everything stays consistent). Recognized revenue is the distance, ARR is the speed. It's critical to recognize that ARR is a rate at a specific point in time used to imply something (here, expected recognized revenue in the future period).</p><p>For the more accounting oriented, another analogy can be made to the balance sheet:</p><figure id="w-node-9fc87f218c80-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b3392b0138c4e64006b_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F6c06ddcc-de3e-4d96-960a-22b4b39e334e_842x455.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>While revenue is the top line metric on the income statement, ARR works more like a balance sheet metric: it is taken at a single point in time rather than over a period of time. This can make income statements confusing and misaligned - another example of the divergence of accounting in economics in subscription businesses.</p><p>Now back to calculus... if the ARR function was actually a mathematical equation, you could integrate it. If y = 10x where y = ARR and x = time in months, then after two months ARR = $20. After 12 months, ARR = $120 (assuming we start from $0 of ARR). So at the end of a year, the business has grown from $0 to $120 in ARR. But what is the recognized revenue? The complex answer is that it's the integral of 10x from 0 to 12 months. (Apologies in advance if this triggers a high school calculus flashback.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b337d3c7911d7362b81_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Ff7fcb57f-644b-490c-bfa8-6d0c986d2fda_305x80.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You could also chart this out and see that it is a right triangle with the area of 1/2*base*height. Where the base is 12 months and the height is $120: $1,440/2 = $720).</p><p>Pretty cool relationship and calculation conceptually, but in real businesses ARR growth doesn't fit a simple equation (or any equation at all), so it's not inherently practical to start breaking out the power rule and your old textbooks to predict ARR growth.</p><p>If we switch back to the car analogy, it takes on a little more of a nuanced meaning. Just like a business doesn't grow on a smooth curve, car speeds do not either. Just like the gas pedal makes the car go faster and the brake pedal &amp; friction make it go slower, so too in a SaaS company, <a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/p/thin-slicing-arr">the new sales are making the speed/ARR increase and the churned customers are making the speed/ARR decrease</a>. I will dive into more details in later posts, but the goal in a car is to go as far and fast as you can while burning the least amount of fuel. So too in a SaaS company, the goal is to have the highest ARR you can, recognize the most revenue and burn the least cash. You can think about SaaS Magic Number like the fuel efficiency of a SaaS business - looking forward to diving into why this is actually helpful in building a company.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maybe you caught this week's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24564775">HN post</a> that <a href="http://www.ghibli.jp/info/013344/">Studio Ghibli</a> dropped 400 images into the public domain. The comments suggested that there's something odd in Japanese copyright law about taking screenshots of films, and that Studio Ghibli might have furnished these to help keep people talking about their films in reviews and whatnot.</p>
<p><span>

<p>A more useful comment gave a nice tip for scraping the images in a single <code>wget</code> command:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>wget</span> --random-wait --timestamping http://www.ghibli.jp/gallery/<span>{</span>ged,chihiro,karigurashi,ponyo,kokurikozaka,marnie,kaguyahime,kazetachinu<span>}</span><span>{</span>001<span>..</span>050<span>}</span>.jpg</code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the nice shell trick of using curly braces <code>{}</code> to expand commands and <code>..</code> to expand in a numerical or alphabetical series. I first encountered this technique in the MIT course for <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">The Missing Semester of your CS Education</a>, which I highly recommend checking out.</p>
<p>For example, <code>echo foo.{png,jpg}</code> will expand to <code>echo foo.png foo.jpg</code>, and <code>echo {1..10}</code> will expand to <code>echo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</code>. </p>
<p>Perhaps this might prove useful in your terminal travels.</p>
<p>Back to Ghibli. So, now that I've got all these screenshots downloaded, what can I do with them?</p>
<h2>My little Raspberry Pi server</h2>
<p>I've got a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C4SK5C3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08C4SK5C3&amp;linkId=6371e9a8ce20a36236014adee9eaa56e">Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM</a> on my home network that I can connect to via <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Usually, I like to SSH in there and <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> just to feel alive. But I also have a few other use-cases.</p>
<p>I run a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> server on the Pi. For a while, I also experimented with running <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> on the Pi, but I just don't have that many internet of things devices (yet). I'm also planning to set up Minecraft server on the Pi, but I haven't found a non-sketchy tutorial yet.</p>
<p>Finally, I also occasionally VNC in using VNC Viewer to check out the latest magazines in the awesome Raspberry Pi magazine app, where they have free subscriptions all these awesome "maker" magazines. This alone is worth the price of a Pi, IMHO.</p>
<p>But, I was getting pretty tired of looking at the same stock desktop background everytime I VNC'ed in.</p>
<h3>Using the Ghibli images as the Pi's desktop background</h3>
<p>There's a neat command to change your Pi's desktop background from the terminal:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>pcman --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/ged009.jpg</code></pre></div>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>Make sure that you've given the proper directory location for your Ghibli images, which, of course, you can get with the <code>pwd</code> print working directory command.</p>
<p>Now, I've already admit that I enjoy manually running apt-get updates, but I definitely don't want to be manually changing the background, so how about some automation?</p>
<h3>Automating a rotating background with a cron job</h3>
<p>We can use a simple cron job for this! First, let's write a one-liner command to randomly set the background from an image in our folder:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>ls</span> /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli <span>|</span> <span>shuf</span> -n <span>1</span> <span>|</span> <span>xargs</span> -I<span>{</span><span>}</span> pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/<span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It looks kinda hairy, but it's pretty simple. First, we list the contents of our directory, then we used <code>shuf</code> to randomly select one of the files. In fact, if you just stopped there, your output would look like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>ls</span> /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli <span>|</span> <span>shuf</span> -n <span>1</span>
karigurashi024.jpg</code></pre></div>
<p>But we want to pipe this randomly selected file to the <code>pcmanfm</code> command! I'm using <code>xargs</code> to do that in the next part of the command. There's probably an easier way, but this works for me.</p>
<p>So, now that we have our command to randomly select a background, we just need to write a cron job to run this command every... let's say, ten minutes. First, open up your computer's crontab file:</p>

<p>And add this to the bottom:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/10 * * * * ls /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli | shuf -n 1 | xargs -I{} pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/{}</code></pre></div>
<p>Save the file, and you're done. Right? No. That didn't work for me. Let's look at the cron logs with this command: <code>grep CRON /var/log/syslog</code></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>raspberrypi CRON[3870]: (pi) CMD (DISPLAY=:0.0 &amp;&amp; ls /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli | shuf -n 1 | xargs -I{} pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/{})
raspberrypi CRON[3866]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)</code></pre></div>
<p>Not super helful. It does confirm that job ran, which is good, though. That rules out cron syntax errors. This <code>info</code> log is interesting. Discarding output. I don't like the sound of that. Googling reveals that we need to install a local mail server, so here we go.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>sudo</span> <span>apt-get</span> <span>install</span> postfix</code></pre></div>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/5af659ddcc5a54584ababc4499e3448d/bff4e/postfix.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="postfix" title="postfix" src="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/5af659ddcc5a54584ababc4499e3448d/a6d36/postfix.png" srcset="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/5af659ddcc5a54584ababc4499e3448d/222b7/postfix.png 163w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>You should choose a "Local" installation. Once we have a mail server, we can now inspect the cron job "mail" logs:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>sudo tail -f /var/mail/pi</code></pre></div>
<p>After a bunch of email header jargon, we finally see the error:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Cannot open display: 

--1332E5E8FA.1601069882/raspberrypi--</code></pre></div>
<p>Awesome! I mean, the cron job still doesn't work, but at least we have some more info. That's a win. So, what have we learned? It seems like our cron job can't "open" the display. Some more Googling suggests that I need to add an env var for the display, so I add this <code>export DISPLAY=:0.0</code> to the beginning on my cron job right after the cron syntax.</p>
<p>Did that fix it? No. But we get a new error message:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Message: x-terminal-emulator has very limited support, consider choose another terminal</code></pre></div>
<p>Cool. Okay, so, what does this one mean? This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45873124/pcmanfm-set-wallpaper-fails-on-raspbian-stretch-in-cron">stack overflow answer</a> suggests that I may need to add another env var to my command. Here goes:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>*/10 * * * * export DISPLAY=":0.0" XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/usr/1000  ls /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli | shuf -n 1 | xargs -I{} pcmanfm --set-wallpaper /home/pi/Pictures/ghibli/{}</code></pre></div>
<p>Yes! Our cron job works!</p>

<p>What are these <code>DISPLAY</code> and <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code>? According to <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/872792/what-is-xdg-runtime-dir">this other Stack Overflow answer</a>, <code>DISPLAY</code> is an address for your display and <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> is a place to store temporary files for your user. Probably some more to dig into here, but for now, I'm just going to stare at my VNC Viewer and watch the background change.</p>
<p>After all this Googling and debugging, we've now got all these cute images keeping our computer happy, even when we're not there.</p>
<p>Automating stuff like this is part of the magic of computers. And that's why I think it goes so well with these magical Studio Ghibli images.</p>
<h2>Watching the Studio Ghibli films</h2>
<p>But, now I've got a ticking clock... </p>
<p>I hate spoilers, and I'm sad to say that I've only seen Howl's Moving Castle (after reading the book earlier this year). I loved it, much more so than book. Which means I need to watch all the Ghibli films <em>fast</em>, before I spoil my way through them with my desktop backgrounds.</p>
<p>In our first episode of the <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/escaping-web-season-one-retrospective">Escaping Web podcast</a>, Oz and I chatted with Felix Tripier who brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a>. I didn't know about the film during our conversation, but I've just discovered that it's available on Hulu. I'll be watching it very soon. As for the rest of films, I've heard they're on HBO GOMAXPROPLUS in the US and Netflix everywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>For now, I'm just glad to have these images on my little server whenever I log in. It's a nice happy thing in my life, and I thank the orange website for the tiny dose of inspiration.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>If you hear faint whooping in the background of your playlists today, it’s just us celebrating a new milestone for Spotify’s open source efforts: <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a> has accepted <a href="https://backstage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backstage</a>, our open source developer portal, as an early stage project in the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNCF Sandbox</a>. It’s just the first step in a longer journey with the CNCF, but it’s an important one for Spotify as it underlines our renewed commitment to open source — and developers everywhere.</p>



<h2>Backstage + CNCF = 🎉</h2>



<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the CNCF, you may recognize them as the home of such hits as Google’s Kubernetes and Lyft’s Envoy. With such a strong foundation watching over our community’s efforts and such an impressive roster of projects leading the way before us, we have high hopes for the future of Backstage — one of our most ambitious open source projects to date.</p>



<p>You’ve heard us talk about Backstage before on this blog — back in March when we <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the open source project</a> and later when we shared <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/04/21/how-we-use-backstage-at-spotify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how we use Backstage internally at Spotify</a>. In a nutshell: Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. Built around a centralized service catalog, it’s designed to streamline your development environment from end to end. We built it to improve the everyday experience and productivity of developers — initially, our own developers, and then when we open sourced it, all developers, everywhere.</p>



<h2>Our commitment to improving developer experience</h2>



<p>At Spotify, Backstage enables us to scale safely and onboard quickly, helping us build and ship the product that hundreds of millions of people around the world use every day. We believe it has the potential to transform how all engineers work together, whether they’re in a 50-person startup or a Fortune 50.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s what Backstage can do for companies and tech organizations, and how it improves developer experience:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Restore order to software ecosystems.</strong> For companies whose infrastructure has become a wilderness of competing technologies and orphaned dependencies hiding in the dark corners of their tech stack, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha" target="_blank">Backstage Service Catalog</a> brings back discoverability, accountability, and control — not to mention sanity. Instead of being overwhelmed by fragmentation and information sprawl, the Backstage Service Catalog creates a centralized system for tracking all your software — making it easy for teams to manage 10 services and making it possible for a company to manage thousands of them.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Jumpstart productivity by standardizing software and tooling.</strong> With software templates, engineers can spin up a new software project in minutes instead of hours. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates" target="_blank">Backstage Software Templates</a> are like automated getting started guides. After an engineer chooses a template, Backstage takes care of the rest — automatically setting up the repo, deploying the first build, and providing a Hello World project, all ready to go — with your organization’s best practices built right in, right from the start. By reducing the number of low-variance choices a developer is forced to consider when starting a project, templates remove friction and allow developers to spend more cycles solving problems higher up in the stack. Standards can set engineers free.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Get unstuck with great technical documentation made easy. </strong>No one can ever find documentation when they need it — and if they do, it might not be that helpful because it hasn’t been kept up to date. Backstage solves both ends of the problem. With <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs" target="_blank">our “docs like code” approach</a>, engineers write their technical documentation in Markdown files right alongside their code. Whenever you create a new project in Backstage, a TechDocs site is automatically set up in the same repo — so you can update your code and your documentation with the same pull request. This integrated workflow and centralization makes great documentation easy. Easy to create and maintain. And easy to find and use.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Customize and scale your infrastructure with a growing ecosystems of plugins.</strong> Every company has their own, homegrown infrastructure — Backstage’s plugin architecture makes it simple to make Backstage a perfect fit for yours. Integrating your custom, proprietary tooling is as simple as building an internal plugin for your installation of Backstage. You can also build open source plugins to share with the community. The open source <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank">plugin marketplace</a> for Backstage continues to grow, expanding Backstage’s functionality with each new plugin. It’s like an app store for your infrastructure.</li></ul>



<p>Backstage has already come a long way — and none of these features would be what they are today without contributions from the open source community.</p>



<h2>Our commitment to the open source community</h2>



<p>We were excited by the reception Backstage received when we first released it. But we’ve been even more gratified by how the community of contributors has grown since then, as they’ve built new <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plugins</a> and added new functionality to the core product. Over <a href="https://github.com/spotify/backstage/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">130 people</a> have contributed to the project, and roughly 40% of pull requests are now coming from external, non-Spotify contributors.</p>



<p>As Principal Product Manager <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/04/01/my-beat-stefan-alund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stefan Ålund</a> writes on the <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/23/backstage-cncf-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backstage blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>We released the open source version of Backstage ‘early’. That was intentional. Because even though we’ve been using Backstage internally for years, we wanted the open source version to be developed with input and contributions from the community. And that’s exactly the product that’s going into the CNCF Sandbox today.</p><p>Backstage’s ability to simplify tooling and standardize engineering practices has attracted interest from other major tech companies, as well as airlines, auto manufacturers, investment firms, and global retailers. We know that Backstage solves a problem — infrastructure complexity — that’s common to a lot of large and growing companies today. But different companies work differently, use particular toolsets, and have unique use cases. By making Backstage open source, we can build it with people working inside a variety of engineering organizations all over the world. It makes for a better product that serves a wider group of users (beyond that of Spotify’s) and their needs.</p></div></blockquote>



<p>Thank you to everyone who has already contributed to this project, inside and outside of Spotify. And if you’ve been curious about Backstage, now is the perfect time to dive in. Visit <a href="https://backstage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backstage.io</a> to learn more and <a href="https://mailchi.mp/spotify/backstage-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribe to our newsletter</a> for updates. Check out open issues on <a href="https://github.com/spotify/backstage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a> or get started building a <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plugin</a> for your favorite tool or service. We look forward to seeing the community grow, and can’t wait to see where open source takes us all next.</p>



<p>We’ll give Remy DeCausemaker — Head of Spotify’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/does-your-organization-need-an-open-source-program-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Source Program Office</a> (OSPO) — the last word:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>We’re excited to embark on this journey with the CNCF community. Backstage isn’t the first open source project Spotify has released, but it is the first one we felt was ready to dedicate to an upstream foundation, and we can’t wait to bring what we’ve learned to the next project. There’s so much great tech being built here, and it’s about time we share it to build even greater products, together.</p></blockquote>

As your data volume and hierarchy levels increase, you will ultimately run out of space on your screen with a traditional hierarchy. That is where the radial tree can add value.

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk showed the road to 56% cheaper batteries in the near future. This would be achieved with Tesla’s breakthrough innovations in cell chemistry and materials, simplifying and speeding up the cell manufacturing processes, a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#structural-battery">structural battery</a>, and the new 4680 form factor.</p>

<h2>4680 cell-based battery architecture</h2>



<p>Vehicle teardown expert Sandy Munro has further analyzed how much this new cell form factor can help Tesla achieve its battery goals. According to his calculations, in the same space of the current 74 kWh <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a> battery pack, a 130 kWh battery can be accommodated — that’s about double the energy storage.</p>

<p>2170 cell is 5000 mAh and Munro’s analysis says the 4680 new Tesla cell will be around ~9000 mAH. Currently, 4,416 (2170) cells are placed inside a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> and Model Y Long-Range battery packs, there will only be 960 cells required to fill the same space (see Fig 2 above).</p>



<p>The 4680 cell-based battery pack will be much simpler and cheaper to build. The 2170 based battery pack architecture is made of cells divided into 4 modules and further into bricks of 46 cells each and every module requires is own controller circuit. </p>

<p>This complexity will be eliminated by using the new 4680 cell design and coupled with the tabless cell construction, the manufacturing process becomes even simpler requiring fewer parts.</p>



<p>Sandy Munro even showed one of the Model Y module spaces filled with his 5070 dummy cells which he predicted before the Battery Day, pretty close idea and the size estimate (see Fig 4).</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#presentation">Battery Day presentation</a>, Elon Musk presented a slide that shows the dissection of 2170 vs. 4680 battery pack. If we look closely (see Fig 6 below), the cooling tubes we see in Fig 5 above are at the bottom of the battery pack.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg" alt="4680 cell-based battery pack to have the coolant tubes under the cells not on the sides like the current 2170 cell-based batteries." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-amp-lightbox="" lightbox="" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg" alt="4680 cell-based battery pack to have the coolant tubes under the cells not on the sides like the current 2170 cell-based batteries." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4680-Battery-Cooling-Bottom.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzU3Nicgd2lkdGg9JzEwMjQnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img><figcaption>Fig 6: 4680 cell-based battery pack to have the coolant tubes under the cells, not on the sides like the current 2170 cell-based batteries.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Sandy Munro, the right way to cool down the batteries is from top and bottom. Currently, in the 2170 battery packs, the cells are cooled from the sides but in the future, Tesla is planning to do it the right way, installing a cooling plate underneath the batteries.</p>



<h2>Rigidity &amp; safety</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#structural-battery">Tesla Structural Battery</a> with new formation of the 4680 cells will be as rigid as a brick you could ever imagine, says Sandy Munro. With single-piece front and rear castings and the structural battery in the middle, Tesla cars will be virtually twist-proof in an accident.</p>



<p>In Elon Musk’s words at the Battery Day event, this formation will reduce the impact of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_moment_of_inertia#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20polar%20moment,material%20composition%20or%20shear%20modulus." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">polar moment of inertia</a>, making Tesla vehicles even safer than they already are.</p>

</amp-ad>
</figure>



<h2>Weight &amp; cost reductions</h2>



<p>Sandy Munro measured the length of the steel case cover of the 2170 battery cells and found out that with lesser number of 4680 cells, Tesla will alone be able to reduce around 30-40% use of steel in the battery pack (see Fig 7 below).</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Usage of steel reduces about 30-40% with the new 4680 battery cells (infographic)." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170..jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-amp-lightbox="" lightbox="" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Usage of steel reduces about 30-40% with the new 4680 battery cells (infographic)." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170.-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Steel-Case-4680-vs-2170..jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" width="1024" height="576" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzU3Nicgd2lkdGg9JzEwMjQnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img><figcaption>Usage of steel reduces about 30-40% with the new 4680 battery cells (infographic).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another cost and time savings with the usage of new 4680 cells will come from reducing the number of connections between the cells. With a significant number of fewer cells, the new battery pack will require around 1,800 connections compared to the current packs with ~8,800 wire tabs.</p>



<p>Sandy Munro then goes on to praise the brilliant idea of the single-piece front and rear underbody castings. A concept he has been promoting since 2017 but no automaker adopted it except for Tesla.</p>

                <p><strong>14 August 2020</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dear Prime Minister, </strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Home Secretary,</strong></p>





<p>We write to you as legal practitioners and legal academics to express our collective concerns about the violations of Mr. Julian Assange’s fundamental human, civil and political rights and the precedent his persecution is setting.</p>



<p>We call on you to act in accordance with national and international law, human rights and the rule of law by bringing an end to the ongoing extradition proceedings and granting Mr. Assange his long overdue freedom – freedom from torture, arbitrary detention and deprivation of liberty, and political persecution.</p>



<ol>
	<li><strong>ILLEGALITY OF POTENTIAL EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Extradition of Mr. Assange from the UK to the US would be illegal on the following grounds: </strong></p>



<ol>
	<li><strong>Risk of being subjected to an unfair trial in the US</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Extradition would be unlawful owing to failure to ensure the protection of Mr. Assange’s fundamental trial rights in the US. Mr. Assange faces show trial at the infamous “Espionage court” of the Eastern District of Virginia, before which no national security defendant has ever succeeded. Here, he faces secret proceedings before a jury picked from a population in which most of the individuals eligible for jury selection work for, or are connected to, the CIA, NSA, DOD or DOS.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>Furthermore, Mr. Assange’s<strong> </strong>legal privilege, a right enshrined in Art. 8 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and long recognised under English common law, was grossly violated through<strong> </strong>constant and criminal video and audio surveillance at the Ecuadorian embassy carried out by the Spanish security firm, UC Global. This surveillance was, according to witness testimony, ordered by the CIA and has triggered an investigation into the owner of UC Global, David Morales, by Spain’s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> The surveillance resulted in all of Mr. Assange’s meetings and conversations being recorded, including those with his lawyers. The Council of Bar and Law Societies of Europe, which represents more than a million European lawyers, has expressed its concerns that these illegal recordings may be used – openly or secretly – in proceedings against Mr. Assange in the event of successful extradition to the US. The Council states that if the information merely became known to the prosecutors, this would present an irremediable breach of Mr. Assange’s fundamental rights to a fair trial under Art. 6 of the ECHR and due process under the US Constitution.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup><sup>[iii]</sup></sup></a> Furthermore, the prosecuting state obtained the totality of Mr. Assange’s legal papers after their unlawful seizure in the Embassy. Upon hearing that the Government of Ecuador was planning to seize and hand over personal belongings of Mr. Assange, including documents, telephones, electronic devices, memory drives, etc. to the US, the UN Special Rapporteur on Privacy, Joseph Cannataci, expressed his serious concern to the Ecuadorian government and twice formally requested it to return Mr. Assange's personal effects to his lawyers, to no avail.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup><sup>[iv]</sup></sup></a> <strong>The UN Model Treaty on Extradition prohibits extradition if the person has not received, or would not receive, the minimum guarantees in criminal proceedings, as enshrined in Art. 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</strong><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup><sup>[v]</sup></sup></a></p>



<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>The political nature of the offence prohibits extradition</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The US superseding indictment issued against Mr. Assange on the 24 June 2020 charges him with 18 counts all related solely to the 2010 publications of US government documents. The publications, comprising information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, US diplomatic cables and Guantanamo Bay, revealed evidence of war crimes, corruption and governmental malfeasance.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup><sup>[vi]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>Charges 1-17 are brought under the Espionage Act 1917, which, in name alone, reveals the political and antiquated nature of the charges.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup><sup>[vii]</sup></sup></a><strong> </strong>Furthermore, the essence of the 18 charges concerns Mr. Assange’s alleged intention to obtain or disclose US state “secrets” in a manner that was damaging to the strategic and national security interests of the US state, to the capability of its armed forces, the work of the security and intelligence services of the US, and to the interests of the US abroad. Thus, the conduct, motivation and purpose attributed to Mr. Assange confirm the political character of the 17 charges brought under the Espionage Act (‘pure political’ offences) and of the hacking charge (a ‘relative political’ offence). In addition, several US government officials have at various times ascribed motives “hostile” to the US to Mr. Assange, an Australian citizen.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup><sup>[viii]</sup></sup></a> <strong>The UK-US Extradition Treaty, which provides the very basis of the extradition request, specifically prohibits extradition for political offences in Art. 4(1). </strong>Yet the presiding judge and prosecution wish to simply disregard this article by referring to the Extradition Act 2003 (“EA”) instead, which does not include the political offence exception. This blatantly ignores the fact that the EA is merely an enabling act that creates the minimum statutory safeguards, but it does not preclude stronger protections from extradition as expressly provided in subsequently ratified treaties such as the UK-US Extradition Treaty. <strong>Furthermore, there is broad international consensus that political offences should not be the basis of extradition.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[ix]</sup></strong></sup></a> This is reflected in Art. 3 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, Art. 3 ECHR, Art. 3(a) of the UN Model Treaty on Extradition, the Interpol Constitution and every bilateral treaty ratified by the US for over a century.</strong></p>



<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the US</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the UN Rapporteur on Torture”), Professor Nils Melzer, has expressed with certainty that, if extradited to the US, Mr. Assange will be exposed to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Similar concerns have also been raised by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Amnesty International has recently restated its concerns in relation to the unacceptable risk of mistreatment.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup><sup>[x]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>The detention conditions, and the draconian punishment of 175 years, in a maximum security prison, which Mr. Assange faces under the US indictment, would constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, according to the current UN Rapporteur on Torture and according to the<strong> </strong>consistently expressed opinion of his predecessor, as well as of NGOs and legal authorities.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup><sup>[xi]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>If extradited, Mr. Assange would, by the US government’s own admission, likely be placed under Special Administrative Measures. These measures prohibit prisoners from contact or communication with all but a few approved individuals, and any approved individuals would not be permitted to report information concerning the prisoner’s treatment to the public, thereby shielding potential torture from public scrutiny and government from accountability.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup><sup>[xii]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p><strong>Under the principle of non-refoulement, it is not permissible to extradite a person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for</strong> <strong>believing that they would be subjected to torture. This principle is enshrined in the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, specifically Art. 33(1) from which no derogations are permitted. Also relevant are Art. 3(1) UN Declaration on Territorial Asylum 1967, Art. 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)</strong>,<strong> and Art. 2 of the Resolution on Asylum to Persons in Danger of Persecution, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1967. As an obligation arising from the prohibition of torture, the principle of non-refoulement in this area is absolute and also takes on the character of a peremptory norm of customary international law, i.e. jus cogens.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xiii]</sup></strong></sup></a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Mr. Assange, who was accepted as a political asylee by the Ecuadorian government owing to what have proved to have been wholly legitimate fears of political persecution and torture in the US, should clearly have been accorded protection of this principle, firstly by Ecuador and secondly by the UK. Ecuador violated its human rights obligations by summarily rescinding Mr. Assange’s asylum in direct contradiction of the ‘Latin American tradition of asylum’<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xiv]</sup></strong></sup></a> and the Advisory Opinion </strong><strong>OC-25/18 of 30 May 2018 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affirming the principle of non-refoulement in cases of persons who have entered an embassy for protection.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xv]</sup></strong></sup></a> The entry of the Ecuadorian Embassy by UK police and the arrest of Mr. Assange were thus based on an illegal revocation of his nationality and asylum, which can only be rectified by the UK upholding its own duty to protect the principle of non-refoulement by denying extradition to the US.</strong></p>



<p><strong>B) VIOLATIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE RIGHT TO KNOW</strong></p>



<p>Counts 1-17 of the indictment under the Espionage Act violate the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of the press and the right to know. These counts present standard and necessary investigative journalistic practices as criminal.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><sup><sup>[xvi]</sup></sup></a> Such practices include indicating availability to receive information, indicating what information is of interest, encouraging the provision of information, receipt of information for the purpose of publication, and publication of information in the public interest.</p>



<p>Under the charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, the initial indictment criminalised also Mr. Assange’s alleged attempt at helping his source to maintain their anonymity while providing the documents in question, which falls squarely under the standard journalistic practice and duty of protecting the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradoxically, the way to help create solutions to the climate crisis is... the same way we got into this mess - <strong>by following the money</strong>.</p>
<p>Most people realize that we all need to create impactful solutions to the urgent environmental situation. An obvious reason why this isn’t the case already is because environmental and economic incentives don’t point the same way.</p>
<p>In order to actually get wide-scale change happening quickly, we have to make use of the main driving factor in our society - capitalism. Broad appeals to people’s emotions unfortunately aren’t getting us where we need to be fast enough. Let’s instead use people’s self-interest to solve issues.</p>
<p>The majority of greenhouse gas emissions today are due to burning fossil fuels for energy usage <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/energy-and-the-environment/where-greenhouse-gases-come-from.php">[1]</a>. Coincidentally, I think that the energy industry is the one which will change the most over the next 30 years. There are a few reasons why this is the case. Ultimately, it is about economics and the very nature of the technologies themselves.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what’s driving these changes:</p>
<h3 id="1-clean-energy-is-free-the-fuel-costs-are-at-least"><a href="#1-clean-energy-is-free-the-fuel-costs-are-at-least" aria-label="1 clean energy is free the fuel costs are at least permalink"></a>1. Clean energy is free (...the fuel costs are at least)</h3>
<p>The fuel costs for solar, wind, and geothermal energy generation are zero. The major costs associated with these types of energy generation technologies are upfront construction and maintenance as necessary. This naturally leads to downwards pressure on prices as abundant, clean, and cheap energy pours onto the grid - encouraged by public sentiment and political subsidies. This has and will continue to turn the utility model on its head in the future.</p>
<h3 id="2-new-business--system-models-are-emerging"><a href="#2-new-business--system-models-are-emerging" aria-label="2 new business  system models are emerging permalink"></a>2. New business &amp; system models are emerging</h3>
<p>For over 100 years, the energy delivery model has remained largely the same. The model is completely centralized. Large power plants generate large amounts of energy. This energy is transmitted over long distances at great expense to you and I and the bakery down the street. It is difficult to predict the exact usage in advance. Because of this, "peak power" plants are turned on quickly to match real-time demand. The peak plants usually operate at enormous costs and are some of the dirtiest gas generation methods.</p>
<p><strong>Enter Distributed Energy</strong>. Technologies generating and working with electricity at or near where it will be used. Rooftop solar, small-scale combined heat and power (CHP), residential smart thermostats, electric vehicles, and behind-the-meter batteries count themselves among this group.</p>
<p>Distributed generation can serve a single structure (i.e. a home or business) but can also be part of a microgrid. It might appear at a major industrial facility, a military base, or a large college campus. When connected to the electric utility’s lower voltage distribution lines, distributed generation can help support delivery of clean, reliable power to additional customers and reduce electricity losses along transmission and distribution lines.</p>
<p>Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are major components in the power system modernization. They are supported strongly by public and environmental drivers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The two-way, transactive grid is a concept which is in its infancy but will only get bigger going forward.</p>
<p><strong>The new economic energy architecture is about everyone financing everyone to build smaller, distributed power plants everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>The companies who win will be those that enable people to participate in the generation, storage, distribution, consumption, and financing of energy. You should position yourself on the right side of this major paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Business model innovation is perhaps more important than technology innovation. The cost curves of wind and solar are decreasing at an encouraging pace, but in order to enable this transition it is imperative that consumers are not expected to bear the burden of financing their own transition towards clean energy. This will be one of the most important factors in converting to a new energy economy, leading directly to our next point….</p>
<h3 id="3-clean-energy-finance-is-big-and-getting-bigger"><a href="#3-clean-energy-finance-is-big-and-getting-bigger" aria-label="3 clean energy finance is big and getting bigger permalink"></a>3. Clean energy finance is big and getting bigger</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/clean-energy-investment-is-set-to-hit-2-6-trillion-this-decade">The results are in</a>. People like social finance, they like impact investing, and they like clean energy.</p>
<p>Historically, capital for solar and wind projects has been limited. The returns banks demanded was high and not commensurate to the adjusted risk/reward for the technologies. Transaction costs were high.</p>
<p>Now let’s think about the financial profile of clean energy projects. These are big projects with stable returns. Most of the risk is in construction. Predictable, regular cash flows are typical.</p>
<p>Financial markets have started to evolve around wind, solar, and the like. We’re now at the point where investors are willing to treat long term power purchase agreements (contracts) with trustworthy counter parties as proxies for bonds. Securitization of clean energy assets is fully on.</p>
<p>In the US, Canada, EU, and other developed areas, commissioned cash flowing projects are now attracting capital at low cost. Pre-construction capital is still expensive, in line with the risks associated with permitting and navigating regulations. Construction capital to build the generation is becoming cheaper as experience and best practices can be applied.</p>
<p>What does the future look like? One very interesting progression could be around the idea of participatory finance. What does that mean? The idea of crowdfunding could be extended to raising funding for the construction of clean energy projects. Groups of individuals banding together to fund and build solar or wind projects as a collaborative investment vehicle. Unlocking the power of the collective could be a game changer for the financing side.</p>
<h3 id="4-controversial-the-utility-death-spiral-is-real"><a href="#4-controversial-the-utility-death-spiral-is-real" aria-label="4 controversial the utility death spiral is real permalink"></a>4. <strong><em>Controversial:</em></strong> The utility death spiral is real</h3>
<p>Now here’s where it starts to get interesting. As participants in the old infrastructure move towards a new distributed infrastructure, they may choose to abandon large-scale grids. Instead, they may rely on localized networks and microgrids.</p>
<p>Currently, energy distribution represents a large (between 22% and 47% of a customer’s total bill) portion of electricity bills. There is also a lot of energy which is lost during the transmission. Total effective energy efficiency is higher the closer the source is to point of use. Every participant on the conventional grid pays to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure underlying this long distance energy transmission.</p>
<p>Well, what happens when people start leaving the grid? It’s still the same cost spread across less participants. Naturally, the cost of grid energy needs to rise in response. This then gives more reason for people to switch off the grid. The grid abandonment and subsequent rising costs create a vicious cycle for utilities…. Dare we use the dreaded words, stranded assets?</p>
<p>Eventually the role of conventional utilities may be more as a warden and administrator for vast networks of connected microgrids. They will be compensated for their ability to ensure a fair and stable system.</p>
<h2 id="tldr"><a href="#tldr" aria-label="tldr permalink"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>The short form of all this is that we can use the same economic engine which drove us down the hole of a carbon-based society to pull ourselves back out of it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about capitalism, it is a strong machine for getting things done. Let’s line up the financial incentives with the well-being of the planet. It might be the only hope.</p></div><p>I write about tips for living a good life, technology, &amp; saving the planet. Keep up with new posts. Unsubscribe whenever.

            <div id="post">
                
                <p><span>25 August 2020</span></p><p>In <a href="https://monokh.com/posts/bitcoin-from-scratch-part-1">Part 1</a>, we discovered the data structures involved in bitcoin and the role they play in the system.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://monokh.com/posts/bitcoin-from-scratch-part-2">Part 2</a>, we combined these concepts into a “node”, which handled transactions and was able to include them in blocks.</p>
<p>This part will produce a running network and some tools to observe it:</p>
<p><a href="https://monokh.com/img/nibble-demo.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://monokh.com/img/nibble-demo.gif"></a></p>
<p>So far, running 2 nodes of this software would produce 2 different branches from the genesis block. This is because <strong>the nodes do not know about each other</strong>. To solve this, we need to implement a network layer as a way for the nodes to communicate.</p>
<p>It turns out, to go beyond a local in memory node, there is a huge amount of architecture involved. The following pieces will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage</strong></li>
<li><strong>P2P Wire protocol</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bootstrap nodes</strong></li>
<li><strong>RPC</strong></li>
<li><strong>Threading</strong></li>
<li><strong>Config</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the huge amount of code changes, we will mostly stick to explaining the concepts in this part.</p>

<p>As always the code can be found on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble">https://github.com/monokh/nibble</a></p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>The first step on the path of making our node resilient is ensuring that any data produced is stored, such that restarting the node will not take us all the way back to the genesis block.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the node’s operation, we need a database that is able to do quick storage and lookups. Additionally, it would be preferable if the database was embeddable and did not require setup to ease the process of starting a node. <a href="https://rocksdb.org/" rel="nofollow">RocksDB</a> fulfills these requirements, it is a key value database that is stored on disk.</p>
<p>Bitcoin uses a combination of LevelDB and binary files. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Core_0.11_(ch_2):_Data_Storage" rel="nofollow">Data Storage</a></p>
<p>Let’s go over the database collections and their purpose:</p>
<p><strong>Blocks</strong></p>
<p><code>blockHash</code> → <code>{ block }</code></p>
<p>We need to store the blocks that the node knows about. Such that we can build on them when mining and to provide this information to other nodes/clients as requested.</p>
<p><strong>Blocks Metadata</strong></p>
<p>We need a way to figure out what the latest block hash and the current block height is. To achieve this using only the blocks database, we would need to retrieve all the blocks and sort them according to their contents. To ease this burden, the metadata database provides some useful indexes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>blockHash</code> → <code>blockNumber</code></li>
<li><code>blockNumber</code> → <code>blockHash</code></li>
<li><code>latest_block_hash</code> → <code>blockHash</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balances</strong></p>
<p><code>publicKey</code> → <code>balance</code></p>
<p>Similar to the metadata stored for blocks, we need to index balances for fast retrieval. Without this, we’d need to iterate through every block and transaction to aggregate a public key's final balance.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, the concept of balance is not core to the data structures. Bitcoin's transactions have inputs and outputs. Outputs (or rather unspent outputs) are the amounts of Bitcoin your public key can spend. These outputs are saved on the node and can be aggregated easily to calculate the balance.</p>
<p>The storage code is very straightforward. Here's an example of updating the database when a new block is being added.</p>
<pre><code>pub fn set_latest_block(db: &amp;DB, block_hash: &amp;String, height: u32) -&gt; Result&lt;(), String&gt; {
    db.put(b"latest_block_hash", block_hash.clone()).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    db.put(block_hash.clone(), height.to_string()).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    db.put(height.to_string(), block_hash.clone()).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    return Ok(());
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="p2p-wire-protocol">P2P Wire Protocol</h2>
<p>As briefly mentioned, to produce a network, nodes need to communicate with each other and reach some form of consensus.</p>
<p>To facilitate this communication, we first need to describe a language for these nodes to use.</p>
<pre><code>const MESSAGE_NEW_PEER: &amp;str = "NEW_PEER";
const MESSAGE_PING: &amp;str = "PING";

const MESSAGE_GET_BLOCK: &amp;str = "GET_BLOCK";
const MESSAGE_GET_BLOCKS: &amp;str = "GET_BLOCKS";

const MESSAGE_NEW_BLOCK: &amp;str = "NEW_BLOCK";
const MESSAGE_NEW_TRANSACTION: &amp;str = "NEW_TRANSACTION";
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>NEW_PEER(address)</code> Sent to a node to notify the node of a peer joining the network. Node responds with all peers it is aware of.</li>
<li><code>PING</code> Ping a node to check it’s availability.</li>
<li><code>GET_BLOCK(hash)</code> Retrieve a block by hash.</li>
<li><code>GET_BLOCKS</code> Retrieve all known block hashes.</li>
<li><code>NEW_BLOCK({block})</code> Sent to a node to notify it of a newly mined block.</li>
<li><code>NEW_TRANSACTION({block})</code> Sent to a node to notify it of a transaction that has just been added to the mempool.</li>
</ul>
<p>A TCP server runs alongside the node that is able to handle and respond to these messages.</p>
<pre><code>impl P2PServer {
    fn handle_get_blocks (&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result <string, string=""> {
        let block_hashes = storage::get_block_hashes(&amp;storage::db::blocks_md(true))?;
        return Ok(serde_json::to_string(&amp;block_hashes).unwrap());
    }
		...
}
</string,></code></pre>
<p>The node will also need to sync up with the network when it starts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Send <code>NEW_PEER</code> for every node it knows about. If the node responds with a list of peers. Do <code>NEW_PEER</code> for each of those</li>
<li>Send <code>GET_BLOCKS</code> to each peer. Calculate the difference between the retrieved block hashes and local <code>latest_block_hash</code>. If there are differences, Retrieve the missing blocks with <code>GET_BLOCK</code> and process them <code>node.processBlock(block)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of this process, the node knows about every peer in the network and has synced it’s version of the blockchain with the other nodes, all the while validating that the blocks are valid according to the <a href="https://monokh.com/posts/bitcoin-from-scratch-part-2#consensus-rules">Consensus rules</a>.</p>
<h3 id="publish">Publish</h3>
<p>From this point on, the nodes are ready to publish new information to each other. For example, if the node successfully mines a block, it will broadcast it to all of it’s peers:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn publish (p2p_data_ref: Arc<mutex<p2pdata>&gt;, req: String, data: String) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box<dyn error::error="">&gt;  {
    let p2p_data = p2p_data_ref.lock().unwrap();
    for peer in &amp;p2p_data.peers {
        if let Err(_e) = send(peer, req.clone(), Some(data.clone())) {
            println!("{}", format!("Failed to publish to peer: {}", peer).red());
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}

pub fn publish_block(p2p_data_ref: Arc<mutex<p2pdata>&gt;, block: block::Block) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box<dyn error::error="">&gt; {
    publish(p2p_data_ref, MESSAGE_NEW_BLOCK.to_string(), serde_json::to_string(&amp;block)?)
}
</dyn></mutex<p2pdata></dyn></mutex<p2pdata></code></pre>
<h2 id="bootstrap-nodes">Bootstrap Nodes</h2>
<p>One question that may popup is, how does a node become aware of other nodes in the first place?</p>
<p>There is an inherent issue in P2P networking: <strong>it is not feasible to troll the vast internet in search of peers</strong>. We need a way to bootstrap into the network and find a set of other peers. This it the role of the “bootstrap” node. In our case, these are just regular nodes that are highly available and it’s address is hardcoded into the node clients.</p>
<p>New nodes will announce their presence to the bootstrap node by sending the <code>NEW_PEER</code> message and will receive other peers to connect to.</p>
<h2 id="rpc">RPC</h2>
<p>The P2P protocol is very lightweight and bare on purpose so that it is able to handle the high volume of interactions.</p>
<p>We also want a convenient interface to interact with the node. For this, blockchains generally use JSON RPC(“Remote Procedure Calls”) servers.</p>
<p>The RPC server provides methods for retrieving data as well as sending transactions using the node’s wallet.</p>
<p>A call looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getbalance",
    "params": [
        "03a23b2369525bf4094db602cd35fa3af24b440a2daf4a3c5e92a54196395d4b41"
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This interface is used under the hood to implement the CLI as well as the web interface.</p>
<h2 id="threading">Threading</h2>
<p>Looking back on Part 2, we went from a local node that simply found PoW for a block and printed it to the console, to a network connected node that is running several processes at the same time. These processes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miner</li>
<li>P2P Server (TCP)</li>
<li>RCP Server</li>
<li>Web Server (Web UI)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important that all of these processes run in their own thread. Threading introduced a few challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>The P2P service should be highly responsive.</li>
<li>The miner should be isolated as it’s a completely blocking process</li>
<li>We need to interrupt the miner from the P2P thread when a new block is received so that it starts building on the latest chain</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/" rel="nofollow">MPSC Channels</a> were used to publish blocks and transactions as the occurred on the node. Mutexes were used to keep the mempool and peer list thread safe while they are being updated.</p>
<h2 id="config">Config</h2>
<p>A simple config file has been implemented to allow multiple nodes with different configurations to be run on the same machine.</p>
<pre><code>rpc_port = 2337
tcp_port = 2338
web_port = 2339
data_dir = "node2_data"
miner_enabled = true
bootstrap_node = "127.0.0.1:1338"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the bootstrap node’s address is defined here.</p>
<h2 id="still-not-complete">Still not complete</h2>
<p>It turns out that building a full robust implementation is extremely time consuming. While we have something here that is valuable for demonstration purposes, there are still a few strides to reach a reliable network. Some of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty adjustment - Currently, difficulty is hardcoded in the software. The bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty such that regardless of how much hash power the network is churning, a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Fault tolerant consensus - Currently our node assumes that blocks come in a consistent fashion and in order. To be truly byzantine fault tolerant, the software needs to handle the nuances of consensus. For example, if there is a fork, the node needs to be able to pick the heaviest chain.</li>
<li>Operating network on public internet - There is an assumption that all nodes in the network are reachable on an unrestricted basis. In reality, firewalls and routers play a big role on what kind of communications the node is capable of making.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-ui">Web UI</h2>
<p>There is a web interface that runs by default on port <code>1339</code>. Using this interface, you can send transactions and explore the blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>This was a fun project. It was disappointing to discontinue it before there was an operational public network. It’s a testament to the meticulous care that has gone into the Bitcoin software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Here’s a picture of my Casio F-91W.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://tpaschalis.github.io/images/casio-f91w.png">
</center>

<p>It’s not fancy, expensive or impressive, but it’s one of my most beloved material possessions (as in, I’d be a little bummed if it was lost or stolen).</p>

<p>I’ve had it for around a year now, and the impulse to get one came from <a href="https://dvt.name/2019/06/03/hacking-the-casio-f-91w-to-handle-1000-psi/">this</a> article about hacking one to handle 1000+ PSI (or ~700m deep). It’s not the most fashionable accessory, has been touted a <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/how-did-the-casio-f91w-become-a-terrorist-icon/">terrorist icon</a>, but as David mentioned above, it’s probably the only watch worn by both Obama and Osama so it’s got <em>that</em> going for it.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I feel that it is an excellent piece of hardware, and the reason I love it is that it embodies many of the things I actually love about technology, and how it can empower humanity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Great Design<br>
It’s actually not that common to find modern interfaces with <em>three</em> buttons. Most toasters or fridges nowadays have more. I’m not sure whether it’s state of the art, but I feel that Dan Norman would be happy to use one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplicity, Discoverability <br>
Its entire functionality can fit in <del>four</del> <a href="https://twitter.com/tpaschalis_/status/1309453292011958273">three tweets</a>, and the manual (not that you need one, but available <a href="https://www.instructionsmanuals.com/sites/default/files/2019-06/Casio-qw415_587_590_593_595_596-en.pdf">here</a>) fits in one page, including pictures. The physical interface and ‘software’, if you can call it that, are seamlessly connected, and I believe anyone could figure how it works even if she hasn’t seen a digital watch in her life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less is More<br>
There is the place for a fourth button, but designers said <em>scratch that</em>, we don’t need it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Affordability<br>
Its price (around €10 or less for clones), makes it accessible for nearly everyone in the globe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Robustness, Build Quality<br>
Battery life is about 7 years. The watch itself doesn’t feel too cheap, is water-resistant, and I don’t ever think about taking it off when getting my hands dirty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disassembly and Repairability<br>
It’s quite easy to disassemble the watch; there are no constructs in place to actively discourage you from doing so. Want to replace the battery? Just remove 4 screws on the back! Want to silence the beeping sound? Easy as well. Don’t like the strap? Grab your tools! This simplicity also contributes to its resiliency and trustworthiness.<br>
People have built <a href="http://casiomod.club/">businesses</a> and communities around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casio/comments/f9ugyu/the_bestworst_casio_f91w_modifications_awards/">modding</a> F91Ws; from adding NFC and SD-card holders, to changing the light color or inverting the screen colors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timelessness <br>
Introduced back in 1989, it has inspired a whole family of variants and still produces over 3 million pieces per year. Ιt’s not that often that digital devices maintain their relevance 30+ years in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limitations<br>
Sure, it’s not perfect. It doesn’t adjust itself for leap years, the light could be brighter, the stopwatch can only count up to one hour, and its accuracy is ±30 seconds per month (~6 minutes per year). But there aren’t any ‘clever’ workarounds to ‘hide’ or make up for them; they’re part of the deal.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="so-what">So, what?</h2>

<p>I’m not sure if you agree, but these are qualities that are hard to find condensed into one product.</p>

<p>I long for the day we can construct F91W-equivalent smartphones, power generators or vehicles for everyone on the planet, and wish for more F91W-like command-line prompts or websites.  I’m talking about tools that are more than fashion statements of brag material, but useful in their own right without having to constantly remind us of their relevance.</p>

<p>But that’s what technology is about, right? Combining art (techne) and skill (-logia) to build things that can make our world a better place™.</p>

The Casio F91W is amazing in many ways. 

One of the most interesting is how its _entire_ functionality can fit in two^H^H three tweets.

Just remember, there are 3 buttons counting anti-clockwise (L), (C) and (A).

~~~
Button (C) always cycles through 'modes'.
- Timekeeping mode; (L) turns the light on. (A) toggles between 12/24-hours view. Long press (A) for an authenticity check.
- Alarm mode; (L) highlights fields (hour/minute) to set, and (A) advances them.
~~~
In alarm mode, press (C) to toggle the alarm, the hourly beep or both. Long pressing (A) sound-tests the alarm.
- Setup Mode; (L) highlights fields to set, from hours, minutes, month, day-of-month, day of week. Use (A) to advance the fields or long press (A) to advance quickly 
~~~
- Stopwatch mode; Press (C) to start/stop the stopwatch. If the timer is stopped, (A) clears the timer. 
If the timer is running, (A) records laptimes, while the timer continues running in the background.
If you stay idle for a minute you'll return in timekeeping mode.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

</figure>

<p>When we do our regular “tools we love” series here @ OnSecurity, we usually talk about hacking tools our pen-testers use for, er, hacking.</p>
<p>I wanted to change it up a bit this time around, and talk about Clubhouse, a tool we use as a business a LOT.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard of it Clubhouse is a workflow or project management platform, designed for software teams.</p>
<p>I would describe it as a ‘pyramid’ system where you view a different layer of detail depending on what your role is, and the lower, more detailed layers feed up to the layers above them.</p>
<p>These layers are the core concept of Clubhouse (I love accidental alliteration (holy crap I just did it again!)). Briefly, they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project - long-term or permanent projects (i.e. back-end dev, UX etc etc)</li>
<li>Epic - large body of work which will deliver a new feature or component. Managers, product owners etc work at this level</li>
<li>Story - The small components that make up a feature, this is the level the developers work at. Stories can be marked as a ‘feature’, ‘bug’ or ‘chore’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stories make up Epics, and Epics are assigned to a project.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to blog about it is that Clubhouse has genuinely had a massive impact on the way we work here at OnSecurity. It has literally made this a nicer and better place to work, which I don’t often find myself saying about a B2B platform (the OnSecurity platform being the other exception of course! :P)</p>
<h4 id="so-why-do-we-love-clubhouse-so-much">So why do we love Clubhouse so much?</h4>
<p>We (like probably a lot of other early-stage companies) used to use Trello for working through stories and pushing out features.</p>
<p>As we grew, Trello boards quickly became messy and disorganized, we frequently found ourselves ditching entire boards and starting new ones in an attempt to regain some organisation, but the situation kept repeating itself and getting worse.</p>
<p>(<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: nothing against Trello, it’s a great tool and brilliantly implemented, it just wasn’t meeting our needs as we grew and there were more people doing more roles.)</p>
<p>Clubhouse, to me, is a bit like Trello, only it’s in 3D, and on Steroids.</p>
<p>It tells people at different layers of the organisation only what they need to know, when they need to know it. As a product person, I operate pretty much only at the “Epic” level - I don’t need to know the details of the individual stories the developers are working on, I just see the lovely “% complete” bar on my epics creeping up as the devs push stuff out.</p>
<p>We’ve found this a super-effective way of “Getting Sh*t Done”™ in product, and it just makes me feel good that I can check-in and see what’s happening without having to bother the developers. I switch off the laptop a happier man in the evenings.</p>
<h4 id="two-ps-in-a-pod-productivity-and-prioritisation">Two P’s in a Pod (Productivity and Prioritisation)</h4>
<p>Owners are assigned to everything within Clubhouse, so inherent accountability is introduced, which has had a very positive impact on productivity. The whole company
can monitor what’s happening at the level and detail they care about. There are no features dropping off the face of the earth or not getting done for unexplained reasons. The communication tools built into Clubhouse mean developers can inherently keep managers updated at all times, for example by tagging in comments on stories. You can assign ‘due by’ dates to stories or epics, however we rarely do this to be honest, unless it’s an urgent bug.</p>
<p>Another nice feature is the ability to easily prioritise epics (and therefore stories), so that when the goals or priorities or the organisation change, you can feed that down to developers by dragging and dropping Epics. That is epic.</p>
<h4 id="pushing-the-boat-out">Pushing the boat out</h4>
<p>The product team found the platform worked so well that we pushed it out to other areas of the business. It is now used heavily by Sales, Marketing and (soon) Customer Success.</p>
<p>Taking marketing as an example, for each blog post we create an Epic. The epic is made up of stories consisting of the steps involved in researching, writing, publishing, publicising and measuring the success of the post. These steps are repeatable, so we just recycle this epic for each new blog post.</p>
<p>The marketing manager only cares about the completeness of the Epic, the stories are each assigned to the people best placed to carry them out, and Sh*t Gets Done™.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.onsecurity.co.uk/blog/tools-we-love-clubhouse/clubhouse_screenshot_2.png" alt="Clubhouse Screenshot of Marketing Epics"> 
</figure>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Well, it’s probably fairly obvious from above that I’d strongly recommend you at least give Clubhouse a try - they now have a free tier so you can use a very full set of features, completely free, for up to ten users. There’s a tonne of other features I haven’t mentioned in this post, but hopefully you get the message. Try it out anyway and see what you think - we haven’t looked back!</p>
<p>What tools do you use in your company that have had a big impact on your operations, culture or even margins?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: OnSecurity is in no way affiliated with Clubhouse (bar the obvious fact that we use it religiously). My friend Al now works there as a designer or illustrator or something (check out his <a href="https://dribbble.com/alzer81">Dribbble</a>), but I don’t like him anywhere near enough to publicise his employers for no reason. I’m writing about Clubhouse here because we like to tell people about tools that are going to help them achieve their goals.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Florin Moldoveanu researches the foundation of quantum mechanics with emphasis on quantum mechanics reconstruction and solving the measurement problem. After getting his PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Maryland at College Park in 1999, he pursued a career in industry. Three years ago he started the transition back from industry to academia and became an adjunct professor at George Mason University. His earlier graduate student research papers in theoretical physics received 267 citations to date.</p><hr><p>More than two years ago, on February 26<sup>th</sup> 2018, I was contacted by the <strong>Royal Society Open Science Journal</strong> to referee a submitted manuscript. Two prior referees had accepted the paper and two had rejected it, and I was the tiebreaker. The manuscript, <em>Quantum Correlations are Weaved by the Spinors of the Euclidean Primitives</em> by Joy Christian, basically claims that Bell’s theorem is incorrect. If true, this would be a game changer in the foundation of quantum mechanics. Bell’s theorem shows that it is impossible to construct a local realistic model of the theory.</p><p>Bell’s result is an impossibility proof; it attracts such passion as the impossibility of perpetual motion machines that were so popular some 100 years ago. A manuscript claiming the invention of a working perpetual motion device, proof that Earth is flat (yes, there is such a thing as an annual conference of Flat-Earth-ers), or that the sun circles Earth would be rejected by any respectable journal right away.</p><p>So, what if someone managed to “disprove” Bell’s theorem and, better yet, to publish that “discovery”? This would create lots of debates and excitement – certainly, notoriety and free publicity for the journal who published your claim. In other words, good business.</p><p>But who is claiming to have “disproven” Bell theorem? Enter Joy Christian, who has been asserting this claim for 13 years. It was debunked by many scientists and scientific panels over the years, yet Christian is not having any of it. Basically, he alleges to have found a method for obtaining the quantum correlation of a Bell pair of particles, by using a Bell “loophole”. In the no-mans-land at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and philosophy, experts in all three fields are scarce. Christian’s ‘method’ is based on a mathematical error, which is ultimately adding apples and oranges, but the error is hard to spot if you are not a genuine expert in geometric algebra. Add to this the language and structure of a well-written physics paper and you might convince an unsuspecting referee to approve your manuscript.</p><p>I had found Christian’s mistake again in the manuscript and I recommended to reject the paper. Certain that it would never be published, I went about my daily business. Imagine my surprise when I heard Christian had somehow managed to publish his nonsense. I thought this impossible; the vote had been 3 to 2 for rejection. I checked and found that indeed, the paper had gotten accepted after submitting a revision. <strong>However,</strong><strong>I was not contacted by the journal to review the revision. </strong>I started contacting colleagues who had to deal with Joy’s claims before, and together with Philippe Grangier, Richard Gill, Howard Wiseman, Brukner Časlav, Gregor Weihs, and Scott Aaronson, in a letter to the journal on July 28<sup>th</sup> 2018, we asked that the article be withdrawn:</p><p><em>Dear Editor-in-Chief,</em></p><p><em>We are writing to you about the publication of the paper “Quantum Correlations are weaved by the spinors of the Euclidean primitives” by Joy Christian in your journal on May 30 2018&nbsp;</em><a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/5/180526" target="_blank"><em>http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/5/180526</em></a></p><p><em>The result of this paper conflicts with an established scientific fact (Bell’s theorem) well known in the foundations of quantum physics and a basis of modern quantum information science; moreover, the subject of recent high-profile experiments (“loophole free tests of Bell’s theorem”). The paper contains numerous errors in elementary algebra, calculus, and logic. The manuscript was rejected by three of the five reviewers,&nbsp;but the editorial process as stated to the reviewers by your journal was not followed:&nbsp;the manuscript was accepted without informing the reviewers&nbsp;and giving them a chance to rebut the misleading statements made by the author (see review history on the link above).</em></p><p><em>The claims made by the author are well known from 2007 and they were disproven in the past (</em><a href="https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1577" target="_blank"><em>https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1577</em></a><em>&nbsp;). From time to time Joy Christian attempts to publish his faulty claims and recently a similar paper was withdrawn by Annals of Physics&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491616300975" target="_blank"><em>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491616300975</em></a></p><p><em>The journal did extend an invitation to write a rebuttal paper but stated that Joy Christian would be a reviewer to the rebuttal. This is not an acceptable course of action from an ethical point of view because it legitimizes scientific dishonesty on behalf of Joy Christian who is well aware of the issues with his arguments for more than 10 years and yet continues to obfuscate the truth.</em></p><p><em>Considering this, we are respectfully asking your journal to withdraw the paper.</em></p><p><em>Sincerely,</em></p><p><em>Florin Moldoveanu&nbsp;- George Mason University (reviewer 5)</em></p><p><em>Richard Gill – Leiden University</em></p><p><em>Howard Wiseman – Griffith University (reviewer 3)</em></p><p><em>Scott Aaronson - University of Texas</em></p><p><em>Philippe Grangier - Institute of Optics, Charles Fabry Laboratory</em></p><p><em>Brukner Caslav - IQOQI - Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Vienna</em></p><p><em>Gregor Weihs – Innsbruck University</em></p><p>This was about two years ago. We kept asking for updates, and when not stonewalling us, the journal kept pushing one roadblock after another.</p><p>The <strong>Royal Society Open Science Journal had more than two years to get their act together. By now, their silence speaks louder than words.</strong></p><p>It is unconscionable that instead of putting extra checks in place for authors with a history of inaccurate publications, the journal violated their own peer review policy and chose to maintain a faulty paper instead of withdrawing it.</p><p>We gave the journal the benefit of the doubt for two years. The passing of time made it clear that the decision to maintain the faulty paper is no accident and no mistake.</p><p>Perhaps this is a symptom of a larger systemic problem with open journals who are paid by the authors to get their papers (usually rejected elsewhere) published. When your salary and livelihood depend on the people you are supposed to enforce rules upon, the temptation to bend those rules is high.</p><p>I grew up in a former communist country of the eastern bloc. At the time of communism, a rule supposed to be enforced by the traffic police was that if you pay for a traffic ticket on the spot, you will be charged with half the fine. You might guess that most officers pocketed that money. The rule only solidified endemic corruption.</p><p>In our case, the author is well known for making the same incorrect argument over and over again. However, <strong>the root of the problem seems to be with the journal</strong>. After all, had they followed their own policy, the problem would not have arisen in the first place. And in case the mistake was genuine (as sometimes mistakes do happen), is two years enough time to get the record straight? It makes me wonder: just how often did the editors turn a blind eye to publication issues to secure revenue? <strong>Is it really a good idea that those in charge of rule enforcement are financially dependent on the rule violators? </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi All! Here we go with part 10 of our <strong>Blazor 2d GameDev</strong> series. Today we’re going to talk about an extremely important tool that can greatly improve game entities management: the <strong>Scene Graph</strong>.</p><p>This is an example, just to give you an idea of what is going to be the result:</p><div><figure><img width="450" height="180" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20450%20180%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blazor-2d-gamedev-scene-graph.gif?resize=450%2C180&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p>You can also check it<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mizrael.github.io/BlazorCanvas/BlazorCanvas.Example9/" target="_blank"> in your browser </a>before moving on.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-9-finite-state-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our last episode,</a> we introduced Finite State Machines. They greatly help cleaning up the mess of procedural code that very often may arise when writing a game. But still, we are adding all our Game Objects to the Game without any kind of relationship. What if we want to model a Solar System?</p><h4>Or, more formally: what if we want to represent parent-child relationships, with the state of the parent influencing the state of its children.</h4><p>There’s a long list of different applications we can have for a Scene Graph, for example handling collisions. Imagine a first-person shooter game: when a bullet is fired against an enemy, there’s no need to check for collisions on an arm if the bullet didn’t collide with the whole body bounding box.</p><p>Let’s start by defining a very simple <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example9/Core/SceneGraph.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SceneGraph class</a>, something like this:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class SceneGraph
{
	public SceneGraph()
	{
		Root = new GameObject();
	}

	public async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
	{
		if (null == Root)
			return;
		await Root.Update(game);
	}
	
	public GameObject Root { get; }
}</pre><p>The Root node is a simple empty GameObject, that will act as a “global container” of all our entities. This will be just a starting point for a simple game. It is missing a lot of functionalities (eg. multiple roots, search, removal), but will work for now. Also, keep in mind that in a game you already have the general structure of the entity tree. A different case would be in an editor, but let’s leave it for another time.</p><p>The next thing we have to do is update the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example9/Core/GameObject.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameObject class </a>and add parent/child relationship:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class GameObject 
{
	private readonly IList&lt;GameObject&gt; _children;

	public GameObject()
	{
		_children = new List&lt;GameObject&gt;();
	}
	
	public IEnumerable&lt;GameObject&gt; Children =&gt; _children;
	public GameObject Parent { get; private set; }

	public void AddChild(GameObject child)
	{
		if (!this.Equals(child.Parent))
			child.Parent?._children.Remove(child);

		child.Parent = this;
		_children.Add(child);
	}
}</pre><p>We’ll also need to make few changes to its <em>Update()</em> method:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
{
	foreach (var component in this.Components)
		await component.Update(game);

	foreach (var child in _children)
		await child.Update(game);
}</pre><p>The idea is to first update all the Components and then move to the Children collection. The flow is basically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search#Vertex_orderings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder DFS</a>, which is fine most of the time. Another option would be using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BFS</a>, but that would make the code a bit more complex to follow.</p><p>Now in our initialization code all we have to do now is instantiating the <strong>Scene Graph</strong> instance and start adding nodes to it:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var sceneGraph = new SceneGraph();

var player = new GameObject();
var sceneGraph.Root.AddChild(player);

var enemies = new GameObject();
var enemy1 = new GameObject();
enemies.AddChild(enemy1);
var enemy2 = new GameObject();
enemies.AddChild(enemy2);
var sceneGraph.Root.AddChild(enemies);</pre><p>Now, in our Solar system game, we want the planets to rotate around the sun and satellites to do the same around planets instead. Using a <strong>Scene Graph </strong>this becomes extremely easy by updating the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example9/Core/Components/TransformComponent.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TransformComponent class</a>:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class TransformComponent : BaseComponent
{
	private Transform _local = Transform.Identity();
	private Transform _world = Transform.Identity();

	public override async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
	{
		_world.Clone(ref _local);
		
		if (null != Owner.Parent &amp;&amp; Owner.Parent.Components.TryGet&lt;TransformComponent&gt;(out var parentTransform))
			_world.Position = _local.Position + parentTransform.World.Position;
	}

	public Transform Local =&gt; _local;
	public Transform World =&gt; _world;
}</pre><p>We basically inherit the parent’s <em>world </em>position and simply use it as offset to the <em>local </em>position of the current Game Object.</p><p>That’s all for today! Next time will see how to improve the asset loading code.</p><p>Ciao!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Microsoft has been increasingly supporting Linux, and the latest application coming to Linux is the Microsoft Edge web browser. About a year ago we saw <a href="https://build5nines.com/microsoft-teams-first-office-app-linux/">Microsoft Teams released as the first Office app for Linux</a>, and now we’re seeing Microsofts Edge web browser too.</p>



<p>Starting in October 2020, Microsoft Edge on Linux will be available to download from the Dev preview channel. Once available, you will be able to go to the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/?form=MO12HB&amp;OCID=MO12HB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Edge Insiders site</a> to download the preview channel of Microsoft Edge on Linux. Alternatively, you will be able to download the application from the native Linux package manager.</p>



<blockquote><p>Starting in October 2020, Microsoft Edge on Linux will be available for download.</p></blockquote>



<p>Once Microsoft Edge on Linux is made available, you will be able to follow the link below to download the application. The Beta, Dev, and Canary Microsoft Edge Insider Channels will be made available for Microsoft Edge on Linux; just as they are for the Windows and macOS platforms.</p>







<p>Also, just as with other platforms, Microsoft will be open to feedback on their new Microsoft Edge browser release for Linux. This builds on their goal to serve customers the best way possible.</p>

		<p>Researchers from St&nbsp;Petersburg University have developed the NeuroPrint soft neuroprosthesis 3D&nbsp;printing technology. In&nbsp;the long term, this can help paralyzed people after spinal cord injury. The new development has already shown its effectiveness in&nbsp;studies on&nbsp;mammals and zebrafish. The results are published in&nbsp;<!--noindex--><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00615-7" target="_blank" rel="1">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a><!--/noindex-->.</p>
<p><img src="https://english.spbu.ru/images/news/2020/09/hybrid_3%D0%94_printing.jpg" alt="hybrid 3Д printing"></p>
<p>According to&nbsp;the World Health Organization, more than a&nbsp;billion people, that&nbsp;is, about&nbsp;15% of&nbsp;the world’s population, have various forms of&nbsp;disability. Every year, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;half a&nbsp;million people receive spinal cord injuries, which are often accompanied by&nbsp;paralysis, and disorders of&nbsp;autonomic functions. To&nbsp;find ways to&nbsp;restore health to&nbsp;people with disabilities, researchers are developing invasive neuroprostheses that can transmit electrical signals to&nbsp;the spinal cord and brain and recover lost functions.</p>
<p>One of&nbsp;the main challenges faced by&nbsp;doctors and scientists is&nbsp;the adjustment of&nbsp;neuroprostheses to&nbsp;the surrounding nerve tissues of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Despite the biocompatible elastic materials, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not always possible to&nbsp;adapt quickly the device to&nbsp;the anatomical and age characteristics of&nbsp;the patient. The solution to&nbsp;this problem has been proposed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;research team headed by&nbsp;Professor Pavel Musienko from the Institute of&nbsp;Translational Biomedicine at&nbsp;St&nbsp;Petersburg University and Professor Ivan Minev from the University of&nbsp;Sheffield (the Department of&nbsp;Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, the University of&nbsp;Sheffield). They have developed a&nbsp;new 3D&nbsp;printing technology that makes it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;rapidly customise muscular and neural implants for monitoring and restoring of&nbsp;motor and autonomic functions.</p>
<p>This patient-specific approach is&nbsp;now possible thanks to&nbsp;NeuroPrint hybrid 3D&nbsp;printing technology. First, the printer creates the geometry of&nbsp;the future implant made of&nbsp;silicone, which also serves as&nbsp;an&nbsp;insulating material. Then microparticles of&nbsp;platinum or&nbsp;another electrically conductive element of&nbsp;the implant are applied to&nbsp;the framework. Then the surface is&nbsp;activated by&nbsp;cold plasma. Moreover, the number and configuration of&nbsp;electrodes in&nbsp;the neural implant can be&nbsp;changed, producing devices for implantation in&nbsp;the tissue of&nbsp;the spinal cord, brain or&nbsp;muscles. The average production time from project creation to&nbsp;prototyping can be&nbsp;just 24&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>‘By the developed technology, the process of&nbsp;creating implants can become a&nbsp;lot faster and cheaper,’ said Professor Pavel Musienko, Head of&nbsp;the Laboratory of&nbsp;Neuroprosthetics at&nbsp;the Institute of&nbsp;Translational Biomedicine, St&nbsp;Petersburg University. ‘Considering the compactness of&nbsp;the equipment and the versatility of&nbsp;the approach, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite likely that in&nbsp;the future it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;produce patient-specific neural implants right in&nbsp;the hospital. This follows the principles of&nbsp;personalized medicine and will minimise the cost and delivery time as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible.’</p>
<p><img src="https://english.spbu.ru/images/news/2020/09/nbme_cover_for_NeuroPrint.jpg" alt="nbme cover for NeuroPrint"></p>
<p>Neuroscientists have already exploited the NeuroPrint technology to&nbsp;carry out research on&nbsp;various model objects&nbsp;— mammals and zebrafish. It&nbsp;has shown that the new neural implants have a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;biointegration and functional stability. Also, they are as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;their counterparts when they are used to&nbsp;restore motor functions of&nbsp;the limbs and monitor the bladder activity. Additionally, the scientists have been able to&nbsp;print soft implants similar in&nbsp;shape and mechanical characteristics to&nbsp;the dura mater&nbsp;— outer connective tissue membrane of&nbsp;the brain. This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important achievement, since many scientific experiments cannot be&nbsp;carried out due to&nbsp;too rigid neuronal implants that are not suitable for the soft structures of&nbsp;the nervous tissue. Moreover, this limits their use in&nbsp;clinical practice.</p>
<p>‘We have tested our development in&nbsp;experiments on&nbsp;freely moving rats for chronic recording of&nbsp;the electrocortical signals of&nbsp;the cerebral cortex, that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;necessary element of&nbsp;the brain-computer interface,’ said Pavel Musienko. ‘The experiments on&nbsp;paralysed animals have shown that electrical stimulation of&nbsp;neural networks effectively restores locomotor function. Thus, the NeuroPrint technology opens up&nbsp;new opportunities both for basic research into the central nervous system and for neuroprosthetics when people suffer from various diseases and injuries.’</p>
<p>Among the participants of&nbsp;the research are scientists from: St&nbsp;Petersburg University; Pavlov Institute of&nbsp;Physiology of&nbsp;the Russian Academy of&nbsp;Sciences; Granov Russian Research Centre of&nbsp;Radiology and Surgical Technologies; St&nbsp;Petersburg State Research Institute of&nbsp;Phthisiopulmonology of&nbsp;the Ministry of&nbsp;Health of&nbsp;the Russian Federation; Ural Federal University; Technische Universität Dresden (Germany); and the University of&nbsp;Sheffield (the UK).</p>
<p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>
<p>The research has been supported by&nbsp;grants from: St&nbsp;Petersburg University; European Research Council; Technische Universität Dresden; the Russian Foundation for Basic Research; the German Research Foundation (the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); and Volkswagen Foundation.</p>

<p>What is the <strong>Fediverse</strong>, or <strong>federated social media</strong>? This is a condensed, simplified, plain English guide to understanding the Fediverse, why it’s awesome, and how to join. You can read the whole article, or skip to <em><a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></em>.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>The Fediverse (federated + universe) is essentially a decentralised social media network of independent &amp; interconnected servers. <em>Federated social media</em>? This definition will make sense once we clear up some concepts.</p>
<p>The best analogy is email. Consider this: Alice makes an email account on the email service provider <code>gmail.com</code>, which is <code>alice@gmail.com</code>. Her friend Bob makes an email account on <code>gmail.com</code> too, which is <code>bob@gmail.com</code>. Alice and Bob can send emails to each other, no problem. Their friend Charlie also makes an email account, but on another email service provider <code>yahoo.com</code>, which is <code>charlie@yahoo.com</code>.</p>
<p>Even though Charlie <code>charlie@yahoo.com</code> uses a different server, he can still communicate via email seamlessly with Alice <code>alice@gmail.com</code>. This is because the two email servers use an underlying “email protocol” to send and receive email. To Alice, it makes no difference whether she’s emailing Bob or Charlie. Why aren’t social media services like that?</p>
<p>Contrast that to Twitter, for example. There’s one “tweet service provider” <code>twitter.com</code>, and you can make accounts only on <code>twitter.com</code> (<code>@alice</code>, <code>@bob</code>, <code>@charlie</code>). While convenient, what if you don’t like how Twitter is handling things? What if they abuse their power and one day arbitrarily delete all of your tweets and account? What if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">Twitter is hacked</a> and leaves everyone vulnerable? You can’t sign up to some other “tweet service provider”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/93qydOh.png" alt="A centralised vs.&nbsp;decentralised network.">
</figure>
<p>Twitter is <strong>centralised</strong>, whilst email is <strong>decentralised</strong>. The Fediverse is like a “decentralised Twitter”. There exists hundreds of various Fediverse <strong>instances</strong> (imagine <code>tweet.com</code>, <code>toot.net</code>, <code>social.org</code>), all of which act as independent Twitters (which we’ll see shortly). Users on these instances can tweet/post to any other user on any instance, and do all the usual things like following, liking, and resharing posts. Imagine Alice tweeting from her account on one instance <code>@alice@toot.net</code> to Charlie’s account on another instance <code>@charlie@social.org</code>. This is the power of the Fediverse.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zdG7B0k.png" alt="A post and reply on Mastodon, a Fediverse instance. Notice the handles in red.">
</figure>
<p>What’s more, the Fediverse is not limited to short “tweet/note” posts, but other forms of media and “activities” posts too. Consider YouTube, basically a centralised social media for video posts and comment posts. Imagine if your Twitter account could “follow/subscribe” a YouTube channel, and “like” and “reply/comment” to their video posts. This experience <a href="https://framatube.org/videos/watch/da2b08d4-a242-4170-b32a-4ec8cbdca701">actually exists</a> in the Fediverse!</p>

<p>In the same way email servers use the “email protocol” (SMTP) to share emails, Fediverse instances use the <strong>ActivityPub</strong> protocol to share activities (creating and liking posts, commenting on videos, resharing images, etc.). There are other protocols, but ActivityPub is the most used. To <em>federate</em> means for two instances to interconnect. Hence, the <strong>Fediverse</strong> is the entire network of federated instances. And it’s pretty big.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-fediverse">Overview of the Fediverse</h2>
<p>By now you understand that the Fediverse isn’t some company or product or service, but a network of <em>independently hosted</em> services. Here are a list of popular federated services that people host on their own websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> - Microblogging. The most popular service and Twitter alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://pleroma.com/">Pleroma</a> - Microblogging. A more lightweight, customisable Twitter alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> - Video streaming. YouTube alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://joinplu.me/">Plume</a> - Federated blogging.</li>
<li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a> - Federated blogging.</li>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/">Lemmy</a> - Link aggregator. Reddit alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://beta.joinpixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> - Photo sharing. Instagram alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://friendi.ca/">Friendica</a> - Microblogging+. Facebook alt.</li>
<li><a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a> - Audio streaming. Spotify alt.</li>
<li>And many more. See <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse.party</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse#Fediverse_software_platforms">Wikipedia list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="https://fediverse.space/">thousands of instances</a> running these services, hosted by everyday people!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What else can I say? I think that fact that a fast Pleroma instance can be hosted on a $3 server speaks for itself<br>
– <a href="https://medium.com/we-distribute/blushy-crushy-fediverse-idol-a-chat-with-lain-about-pleroma-4ff578b99752#5444"><em>Lain</em></a>, creator of <a href="https://pleroma.com/">Pleroma</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, all of these services are interconnected and work pretty much seamlessly. Users can interact with others users and content across the entire network. They are truly free to roam, unlike the walled gardens of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MDoyecc.png" alt="Mastodon, Pleroma, and PeerTube on mobile. All interconnected.">
</figure>
<p>Instances provide common activities such as liking, following, boosting/forwarding/resharing, commenting/replying, attachments, and polls, as well as extra features such as <em>content warnings</em>, <em>local &amp; global timelines</em>, custom emoji, and more. #Hashtags and <span data-cites="mentions">@mentions</span> are also supported.</p>
<p>Servers aren’t the whole story. While you can always access your Fediverse account in your web browser, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">various mobile and desktop apps</a> exist as Fediverse clients, so users can post and browse from wherever they please. Since these apps all talk the same ActivityPub protocol, they can be used to log into any pretty much any Fediverse server, with minor differences.</p>
<p>Because of the decentralised nature, instances feel like small towns (or big cities), and you’re free to travel the universe anytime. This homely feel allows for the flourishing of communities, while avoiding feeling like your voice is anchored to one place.</p>
<p>Some instances are international and generic like <a href="https://mas.to/public">mastodon.xyz</a>. Some are focused around a region or language, like Swedish <a href="https://fikaverse.club/public">fikaverse.club</a>, or Japanese <a href="https://mstdn.jp/public">mstdn.jp</a>. Some are topic based, like Free software <a href="https://floss.social/public">floss.social</a>, fan culture, gaming, art, activism, lgbt+, cat pics, etc. Some are big and bustling, while others are small and cozy. There’s probably one suited to you. If choosing an instance is overwhelming, start out with a generic one. They’re all interconnected after all, so there’s no huge commitment.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Want a glimpse of the Fediverse? Don’t know where to start? You can’t go wrong with a creating an account on a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> instance. It’s the most popular and de facto service. If you’re feeling adventurous, <a href="https://fediverse.network/">Fediverse.network</a> has a list of other known Fediverse instances. I recommend signing up to an instance running either Mastodon or Pleroma, since those will be familiar, Twitter-like microblogging instances.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EIlnJXc.png" alt="Pick a Mastodon instance and browse the Fediverse.">
</figure>
<p>Once you’ve created an account, you may want to access your feed on your mobile. If so, I recommend the <a href="https://huskyapp.dev/"><em>Husky</em></a> app for Android, or the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1220921451"><em>Toot!</em></a> app for iOS. Simply choose your instance when prompted, then sign into your account.</p>
<p>Time to explore! Most instances split feeds into three categories or timelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home - Posts from users you follow.</li>
<li>Local, public - All public posts from users on the instance.</li>
<li>Federated, global - All public posts, from all users, from anywhere the instance has ever come across.</li>
</ul>
<p>When starting out, checking out the local or global timeline is a good place to find users to follow. Be sure to say hi too, since even without any followers, others will see you pop up on their local timeline. Fediverse users are always friendly and welcoming to newcomers on their instance.</p>

<h3 id="moderation">Moderation</h3>
<p>There are other benefits to a federated social network. Big centralised networks tend to suffer from a lack of moderation and supervision. Spam, trolls, bots, malicious agents, and vulgar content can overwhelm such a network, and leave an admin paralysed by decision, trying to please everyone.</p>
<p>The Fediverse generally handles spam much more gracefully and is more resilient by nature. Instance admins can react more quickly to spam. They can set what ever moderation policies they like, and choose which other instances to <em>not</em> federate with (essentially block) if they don’t find their content appropriate. This gives users more of a choice as to where they feel most comfortable. Everybody wins.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-and-trust">Privacy and trust</h3>
<p>Of course, big centralised networks are heavily criticised for abusing users’ trust and naïvety, collecting and selling private data (searches, images, friends, location) without consent from family and children, and calculating their behaviour patterns, sexual orientation, and vulnerable biases and insecurities to target with ads. The incentive to monetize your private data is so strong, companies will do anything, pass the threshold of creepy.</p>
<p>Most Fediverse servers run on <strong>Free and Open Source</strong> software, meaning that anyone’s nerdy friend can glance at the code and verify that no such nefarious data-harvesting business is going on. It’s very rare to see ads on the Fediverse, since running a server often isn’t too expensive to do. Hosters even tend to crowdfund (successfully so) instead of selling your data. As such, people feel much more comfortable and open on the Fediverse.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation-and-fake-news">Manipulation and fake news</h3>
<p>Arbitrary banning, harmful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shadowban">shadowbanning</a>, and of course targeted ads, all create a web of distrust and disorientation. It’s well known that big corporations and governments use their money and influence to obfuscate narratives for their own benefit, at the expense of users. This even happens internally within the big tech giants.</p>
<p>Posts and conversations on the Fediverse are guaranteed to spread and grow organically, free from manipulation, since no instance governs, controls, or is dependent on another. It’s also much harder for a “foreign power” to successfully abuse every instance of the entire network and target people with fake news. The Fediverse culture is therefore much more critical and fruitful.</p>
<h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>One thing centralised networks have an advantage over the Fediverse is that they can provide easy search for users, since they have all the data in one place. Fediverse users can capably search over their local instance, but need more patience when searching over the entire network. A side effect is a weaker set of “overview” features like “trending” or “hashtags”.</p>
<p>Some, however, like it that way. On big central networks, you never know …</p></article></div></div>

September 25, 2020 | https://bryllyant.com/blog/creating-a-pitch-deck-for-your-new-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bryllyant.com/blog/creating-a-pitch-deck-for-your-new-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>What is a pitch deck?</h2>
<p>Basically, think of your pitch deck as your startup’s resume and interview prep all in one.</p>
<p>A pitch deck is a brief presentation that informs potential investors, partners, customers, and the public/media about your product. It should be short enough to keep their attention, but long enough to give them a clear understanding of your product, vision, and goals for your company. </p>
<p>You will notice that we said that your presentation should be brief. You are the expert about your tech and, of course, excited to share all the details with anyone who will listen. You and your team have spent long hours and invested tons of sweat equity, getting it to where it is today. Save the lengthy explanations for your friends and family. Your pitch should be as short and concise as possible, without omitting any important information, this will ensure that people stay fully engaged.</p>
<p>What does brief mean? Your pitch deck should contain about 18-20 slides, each one containing one big idea. Focus on keeping a balance between the number of slides and presenting a clean, clear message.</p>
<p>So, all a founder has to do is create one slide deck that details the product, and they are good to go? </p>
<p>Not really, just like career consultants advise job seekers to tailor their resumes and cover letters to the job they are seeking, you should also customize your pitch deck to different targets. </p>
<h2>1. Realize That One Size Does Not Fit All</h2>
<p>Each audience will be looking for specific details about your firm, and having customized presentations speaks volumes about your organization’s proactive nature and level of professionalism.</p>
<p>How many presentations should you prepare? That really depends on your product, your funding stage, and your application. But, at any time, you should have at least three slide decks ready that address the questions, concerns, and issues that the below audiences may have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Investor/VC’s</li>
<li>Partner’s /Customer</li>
<li>General Public/Media</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you get nervous, know that you will not need to recreate the wheel for each pitch deck, but you certainly should customize the content and its complexity.</p>
<h2>2. Know Your Audience</h2>
<p><em>Investors/VC’s</em></p>
<p>For your startup, the pitch deck will likely be your most vital fundraising tool, whether you’re looking to raise $50,000, $500,000, or $50 million. In the same way that human resource managers see endless resumes each day and candidates have only a few moments to catch their eye, funders see scores of pitch decks each week, and according to <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/2020-docsend-startup-index/#:~:text=The%20main%20trend%20that%20founders,in%20your%20send%20ahead%20deck." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DocSend</a>, VCs spend only about 3:23 minutes on a successful pitch deck.</p>
<p>What do you need to do to ensure that your presentation has what it takes to wow them? Follow in the footsteps of those who have done it before and have been successful. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, Palantir, president of Clarium Capital Management, and early angel investor in Facebook certainly knows his way around the venture capital world. He suggested that VC/fundraising presentations be clear, simple, compelling, easy to act on, and include the following components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem</li>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Market Size</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Traction</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Financials</li>
<li>Amount being raised</li>
</ul>
<p>And while there is no doubt that Peter has been highly successful, both as a founder and as an investor, we might suggest a slight tweak to his list to include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover slide</li>
<li>Problem/Need Gap</li>
<li>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Why you/Why now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Business </p>
<ul>
<li>Market size</li>
<li>Competitive landscape</li>
<li>Trends</li>
<li>Financials</li>
<li>Business model</li>
<li>Amount being raised</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Traction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next steps </p>
<ul>
<li>Roadmap - Go to Market</li>
<li>Future directions</li>
<li>The Ask</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Tell The Story</h2>
<p><strong>Investor Deck</strong></p>
<p><em>Cover Slide</em></p>
<p>You may ask, since investors are going to spend less than four minutes reviewing my pitch deck shouldn't I skip a cover slide and get right to the point? Your pitch deck is doing more than conveying facts and figures; it is telling a story.</p>
<p>Think of going to the movie theater and watching the trailers. You get excited by that short snippet of storytelling and will look forward to seeing that movie. Your cover slide is the trailer for your presentation. It builds expectations about what you, your tech, and your startup are about. Your cover slide should, of course, include your logo and contact information, but more importantly, it should focus on what is at the heart of your solution. You need to demonstrate not just the value of your tech, but also your creativity and pride in what you are building. This is where you showcase your cause, your brand, and where you can build a connection with your audience. You help to build that connection by including both a tagline (think of Nike’s Just Do It) and an impactful image that brings to mind what you seek to achieve. Are you creating a cooking application that integrates recipes, pictures, and instructions with streaming video so that people can work on the same recipe across the miles? Use an image that evokes all of the feelings of cooking at home with a loved one.</p>
<p><em>Problem/Need Gap</em></p>
<p>Once you have your audience drawn into your story, you can then share the ONE painful problem with which many people can relate and that you know the investors will understand. Note that we said one, not two, or three problems. </p>
<p>You do not want to overwhelm investors, and you want to show them how focused you are on achieving your mission.</p>
<p><em>Solution</em></p>
<p>You must be able to communicate as simply as possible a description of your tech and how it works – no deep dives here. It is also vital to share the benefits to the user(s) and to have available a great short product demo.</p>
<p>Investors will want to understand why your solution is the right one as there undoubtedly other companies tackling the same challenge with different approaches. You will also need to articulate why now is the right time for your tech. <a href="https://bryllyant.com/blog/why-your-startup-needs-a-tech-co-founder-or-chief-technology-officer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Timing</a> is critical to startups facing a rapidly changing marketplace and competition racing to get to launch first.</p>
<p><em>The Business</em></p>
<p>This is the part of the pitch that potential investors are here for; how will your unique product make you and them money? They may believe in your solution, and they may even like you, but they are investors after all, and they are looking for their return. You need to clearly explain how large you believe your company can be (market size and competitive landscape – <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/bottom-up-or-top-down-market-analysis-which-should-you-use.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">utilize top-down or bottom-up analysis</a>), where it is going (trends), what are you going to spend to get you there (financials), how you are going to get there (business model), how much funding do you need to get you there (amount being raised), who will get you there (team), and what you have already accomplished (traction.)</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p><em>Roadmap - Go to Market</em></p>
<p>This slide will make it simple for a VC to envision how you will grow your audience or scale. Especially as an early-stage startup, you have no way of knowing if any of your ideas will be successful, but that is the nature of all new businesses. As you move through stages of funding and implement different strategies, you can update the slide with your wins and refined tactics.</p>
<p>Airbnb pitched a 'dual posting feature' to investors in which host properties would be listed on Kayak.com. That partnership never came to fruition, but they developed a bot function that reposted any Airbnb listing on Craigslist and linked back to Airbnb, increasing traffic.</p>
<p><em>Future Directions</em></p>
<p>Remember when we said to focus on only one problem and one solution? Well, this is your chance to share your long-term vision for what your tech can be in five or ten years. Start like Jeff Bezos, pitch your online bookstore, but share your vision for the everything store for everyone. This slide can also share opportunities for new markets, partnerships, or collaborations.</p>
<p><em>The Ask</em></p>
<p>The answer is always no if you never ask the question. This slide should be tailored to the specific funder/investor, their capacity, and their engagement. Be sure to align the size of your ask with funding that they have provided to startups like your own. This means doing your research before the pitch meeting. Over or under-asking can start a relationship off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p><strong>Partner/Customer Deck</strong></p>
<p>Since you will want to engage partners and customers at a similar level as investors, but they will have less, well, invested, their deck does not need to be quite as detailed.</p>
<p>They will still be interested in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover slide</li>
<li>
<p>Problem/Need Gap – from THEIR perspective</p>
<ul>
<li>Solution - Product</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Business </p>
<ul>
<li>Success stories</li>
<li>Competitive advantage</li>
<li>Trends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next steps </p>
<ul>
<li>How can they buy from you or work with you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Public/Media Deck</strong></p>
<p>This is sometimes called a “send out” deck and helps garner interest in your product. Your goal should always be to only pitch in person, but a send-out deck can be especially useful with the media. The content shared here should be pared down significantly and can often be accomplished with a one page PDF. It should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem</li>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Traction</li>
<li>Market details – brief</li>
<li>Competition – why you are better</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>How to contact/learn more</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Make It Flawless</h2>
<p><em>Design</em></p>
<p>Once you have the content you need for your pitch, it is time to make it look amazing. There are a plethora of presentation software tools available; just a few to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canva</li>
<li>Prezi</li>
<li>DocSend</li>
<li>Beautiful.AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which solution you choose, remember that the design, while being professional and streamlined, is not the star of the show. It is merely the backdrop for your information. Think of it as wearing a subdued, well-fitting outfit to an interview. It sets the stage but does not distract from the candidate.</p>
<p>As with any presentation, do not put all of your details on your slides. You do not want your audience to read from a screen. Instead, you want them to focus on the content and engaging with you.</p>
<p><em>Proofing</em></p>
<p>You have only one chance to make a first impression. Proof, proof, and proof your pitch deck again. Share it with other members of your team. If you have trusted people outside of your team, share it with them. Glaring errors often become invisible to us when we are deeply immersed …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Apple’s strategy for years has been to <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/10/23/iwork-13-a-huge-regression/">trade desktop power for cross-device feature parity</a>. As expected, <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/">macOS Big Sur</a> continues this trend, emphasizing a consistent user interface across devices, and focusing on cross-device development technologies like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Catalyst</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I wish Apple had different priorities. I’d like to see more apps like <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, an industry-leading creative app that’s built top to bottom on Apple technologies. But Sketch was released in 2010, and Apple hasn’t created any new frameworks like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics">Core Graphics</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage">Core Image</a> that support these kinds of apps in over a decade. So I wasn’t holding my breath for them to announce anything new for these kinds of apps at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC</a> this year.</p>

<p>Since Apple isn’t prioritizing powerful desktop apps with their own technologies, that means supporting these use cases mostly falls on third parties. This is where companies like <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/?promoid=29NMCNT6&amp;mv=other">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.avid.com/">Avid</a>, <a href="https://www.maxonlift.com/">Maxon</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> come in. While Apple’s priorities regarding their own technologies have been clear for awhile now, what hasn’t been clear is their priorities for third-party apps, in particular, ones that aren’t sandboxed. The trend for the last few years has been making it harder to develop these kinds of apps for macOS. <a href="https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/new-apple-event-apis-in-macos-mojave">AEpocalypse</a> (2018), <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/23/annoying-catalina-security-features/">Catalina’s security features</a> (2019), and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution">Notarization</a> (2018) are all examples of this trend.</p>

<p>The overarching reason behind the changes that make developing these kinds of apps harder is “Security”. And unlike cross-device feature parity, it’s unclear exactly where this all ends. Because after all, the most secure system there is is the one that doesn’t run any software at all. That’s why it’s such a pleasant surprise, that, as far as I can tell, Apple has done everything they can to make Big Sur, and the accompanying transition to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, as seamless as possible, even for apps that aren’t sandboxed.</p>

<p>Some were predicting that Macs on Apple Silicon wouldn’t even run apps from outside of the Mac App Store, that didn’t happen. It <a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2020/6/educated_guesses_about_a_mac_transition_to_arm.html">seemed more likely</a> that Apple would drop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL">OpenCL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>, but those are <a href="https://twitter.com/colincornaby/status/1275153748348682240">sticking along for the ride</a>. No details were known about whether there would be an emulation layer like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28software%29">original Rosetta</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple's_transition_to_Intel_processors">2006 Intel transition</a>. Apple appears to have gone above in beyond with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>, which even supports plug-ins like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology">VSTis</a>, giving lots of options for migration paths for powerful modular software.</p>

<p>I’m still frustrated that there probably won’t be another Sketch for the foreseeable future, but that ship sailed a long time ago. And no other platform has a Sketch either, an industry defining app that’s a platform exclusive, so while Apple has lost a unique advantage that only they had, they haven’t lost anything that other platforms already have. Other platforms can run powerful modular software that’s distributed outside the Mac App Store, but today, so can new Macs running Big Sur. Here’s to hoping that the dust has settled, and the last of the restrictions on third-party apps are behind us now.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the merge associativity law states that having extra "rungs" in the history "ladder" between two branches ought not to make a difference in the final result.</p><p>There are still some people who still think nothing is wrong with git; that it is okay for the result of a merge to depend on how things are merged rather than on only what is merged; that is it okay for two git repositories that pull the same patches to have different contents depending on how they pulled those patches.  I don’t know what to say to those people.  Such a view seems like insanity to me.

				<p>My wife and I became reluctant homeschoolers this year. Not the "fully remote" kind of homeschooling, but the "unenroll our kid and go at it alone" kind. </p><p>We didn't decide to homeschool for theological reasons. Rachel and I come from evangelical backgrounds, but if we wanted to raise our daughter in a bubble, we wouldn't have <a href="https://baugues.com/moving-to-brooklyn">moved to Brooklyn four years ago</a>. We didn't decide to homeschool because we had a bad public school experience. We had a great public school experience. Universal Pre-K exceeded all our expectations, as did kindergarten at <a href="https://baugues.com/p/cd58703c-7f95-45a3-91b8-7a64f30fcc26/ps32.org">PS 32</a>. </p><p>Quick story about PS 32 – A few days after we found out Emma had been accepted into their gifted and talented program, and several weeks before school started, we attended an informational DOE meeting and coincidentally sat next to Ms. Watson-Adin, the principal of PS 32. After the presentation, we introduced ourselves and told her that we had registered our daughter for PS 32 that morning.</p><p>"What's her name?" Ms. Watson-Adin asked. </p><p>"Emma." </p><p>"Emma Baugues?" </p><p>Our jaws dropped a bit. "How do you know her name?" </p><p>"I know all my kids' names," she replied.</p><p>"How many kids do you have?" </p><p>"About five hundred." </p><p>Our respect for Ms. Watson-Adin's dedication to her students has only increased since. We were skeptical of New York public schools before we started – but we had a wonderful experience. They're imperfect, but there was no point between Pre-K and Covid-19 where we thought, "We could do a better job than they're doing." </p><p>Hence, our reluctance to pull Emma out. </p><p>We're about four weeks into our homeschool experiment, and it's going well enough that I feel some sense of obligation/opportunity to share our story in hopes that it helps other parents navigate the difficult choices to be made this year. That said, I want to acknowledge that we're operating from a privileged position. We have one daughter. She's in first grade. We're expecting our second daughter in November. My wife, Rachel, has been a stay-at-home mom since Emma was born. I work for a software company and have been working from home since March. </p><p>The stars aligned to make homeschooling an easy decision <em>for us.</em> I don't want to imply that everyone else should make the same decision, and I know that a lot of folks simply <em>can't</em>. That said, homeschooling is an interesting alternative to remote learning, and we haven't heard a lot of folks talk about it. </p><p>Schools in NYC shutdown on March 16, 2020. April through June, we finished out Kindergarten via remote learning. Ms. Watson-Adin and our teachers and made a heroic effort to make it work, but between five year olds on Zoom and everyone suffering through the onset of a global pandemic, I think it's fair to say remote learning in Spring 2020 was a wash. </p><p>Coming into September, we felt we had three choices:</p><ol><li>Hybrid learning. A few days in the building, a few days remote. </li><li>Remote learning. Do public school from home. </li><li>Homeschool. Decouple ourselves from the public school system altogether. &nbsp;</li></ol><p>Here's how we evaluated those options, and why we eventually decided to homeschool Emma. </p><h2 id="option-1-hybrid-learning">Option 1: Hybrid Learning </h2><p>The first question to wrestle with was, "Do we feel comfortable sending her into the building?" The answer here was, "No." </p><p>Based on our <a href="https://baugues.com/coming-over">mental model of how Covid-19 spreads</a> – by breathing the same air as an infected person for a prolonged duration – we don't believe teachers and administrators can make the in-class experience safe. Even if they were getting adequate training, funding, and guidance from local and federal government – <strong>which they're not</strong> – they can't defy physics. </p><p>But, even if Emma was somehow immune to Covid-19, I'd be concerned about the learning environment that she'd find at school this year. Teaching public school was hard <em>before</em> the pandemic. Now we're asking teachers and administrators to put their lives at risk to teach under unprecedented conditions. We know that stress and trauma makes it harder for adults to do their job, and makes it harder for kids to do well in school. Schools this year will have a lot of stress and trauma. </p><p>That fact that Rachel and I don't <em>need </em>childcare made it an easy decision to keep Emma home. </p><h2 id="option-2-remote-learning">Option 2 - Remote Learning</h2><p>Any parent not sending their kid into the building is "homeschooling" to some extent. The questions are, "What curriculum do you use?" and "Who's the teacher?" The default solution is to use your local school's remote learning option, but it might make sense to step back and ask, "are the reasons we chose that school last year still valid?" </p><p>Overgeneralizing here, but parents choose a school to meet three needs: </p><ol><li>Education </li><li>Childcare </li><li>Community</li></ol><p>Before Covid, <em>proximity</em> was the primary factor when choosing a school. You can't get childcare and community unless you're close. This year, your local school's value proposition changed. </p><p><strong>Community.</strong> Emma, Rachel, and I all benefitted<em> </em>greatly from the social aspects of in-person public school. Each of us have met many good friends there. Unfortunately, Emma didn't get much socialization benefit from daily Zoom calls with fifteen five year olds in the Spring, and parent-to-parent interaction is close to nil when you remove in-person activities. </p><p>Now, that's considering what we <em>get</em> when it comes to community. PS 32 also is a place for us to <em>give</em>. When <a href="https://baugues.com/p/cd58703c-7f95-45a3-91b8-7a64f30fcc26/deray.com">DeRay McKesson</a> speaks about the difference between a <em>resident </em>of a community versus a <em>citizen</em> of a community, he uses the example of <em>citizens</em> choosing to invest in the local public school even if they don't have kids in it. Last year, Rachel and I felt an obligation to invest in PS 32, which we did by volunteering at the school and contributing to the PTA. We've committed to doing the same this year, even if Emma's not enrolled.</p><p><strong>Childcare. </strong>As a society, I don't think we fully appreciated the childcare component of schools until a whole bunch of parents couldn't go to work because they didn't have a safe place to put their kids. In our case, school meant Rachel had a few hours a day when she could run errands, prep meals, clean the house, or practice self-care after five years of taking care of a kid full-time. Those hours were especially valuable when I was on the road for work. </p><p>We're not getting a childcare benefit from school this year. </p><p><strong>Education. </strong>When it comes to collocated education, PS 32 did a better job educating Emma than we would have. Full stop. Her kindergarten teacher, Ms. Ryan, has been described by many parents as "Marry Poppins." She is <em>so good. </em>Emma's teachers at PS 32 for art, music, dance, gym, and science are <em>so good. </em></p><p>Now that learning has moved online, it's worth asking, <em>"</em>What are the odds that the NYC Department of Education – an underfunded, technologically incompetent bureaucracy that's been thinking about remote learning for six months – is the best available provider of in-home elementary education?" </p><p>In the startup world, we consistently see small scrappy startups outmaneuver incumbents because they can laser focus on a single problem and change directions quickly. The DOE employees over 75,000 teachers, is constrained by decades of regulation and powerful unions, and has a mandate to equitably serve over 1.1 million students. It'd be hard to design an institution that's less capable of adapting to change. Alas, they're trying to tackle two big challenges simultaneously: safely reopening the buildings and rolling out remote education. </p><p>People and institutions get better at doing things via a feedback cycle of: <em>Do the thing -&gt; Get Feedback -&gt; Make Improvements -&gt; Repeat.</em> The DOE is, charitably, on its second iteration of this cycle. There's little reason to believe that the DOE will be the best provider of in-home education this year. There's little reason to believe that they'll even be competent at it. That's not to take anything away from the teachers, staff, and administrators. They are working <em>so damn hard. </em>The people are great. The institution is ineffective. </p><p>Is it possible that there are educational service providers who are more adaptable to change and who have been been iterating on in-home education for years? </p><h2 id="option-3-homeschooling">Option 3 - Homeschooling</h2><p>That town hall meeting also made us realize that everything DOE related was going to be chaos this year. Start dates get pushed back at the last minute. Teachers don't have classroom assignments yet. Five different services to sign into, all with different credentials. Zoom for five hours a day starting at 8:30am.... and then somedays there no live instruction at all. Any given day your school might have an outbreak that shoves everything into disarray. Parents stressed out and venting their anxiety in all different directions. </p><p>There's a lot of chaos consuming mental cycles before the teaching even begins. </p><p>Shortly after that town hall, we decided to decouple ourselves from the chaos. We <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enrollment-help/home-schooling">sent our letter of intent to homeschool to the DOE</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://baugues.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-19-at-9.22.22-PM.png"></figure><p>We emailed Ms. Watson-Adin to let her know that we were pulling Emma out but hoped to send her back to PS 32 in 2021. Ms. Watson-Adin called us fifteen minutes later. She said she was sad we were leaving, but that she understood, and that Emma would be welcomed back next year. She talked about a few of the absurdly difficult problems she was trying to solve that week, and said, "all we can do is one day at a time." We told her that we appreciated all the work she was doing and would continue to support her and the school however we could. &nbsp;</p><p>Then we started to figure out how to homeschool. </p><p>We started by googling, "secular homeschool curriculum." We're still figuring out what to tell Emma about God, but we don't need the same person who creates that material writing our Math book. After evaluating several providers, we ordered the Age 5-7 curriculum from <a href="https://movingbeyondthepage.com/">Moving Beyond the Page</a>, which cost about $600. We got immediate access to the digital curriculum. A few weeks later, first grade showed up at our door: </p><figure><img src="https://baugues.com/content/images/2020/09/L1050067.jpg"></figure><figure><img src="https://baugues.com/content/images/2020/09/IMG_20200829_121832.jpg"></figure><p>In our house, first grade started in mid-August. It's only been four weeks, so I can tell you what we've been doing, but it'll be a …</p></section></div>

<p>
Before reading this article, please read the article
<a href="https://www.go101.org/article/channel.html">channels in Go</a>,
which explains channel types and values in detail.
New gophers may need to read that article and the current one several times
to master Go channel programming.
</p><p>

The remaining of this article will show many channel use cases.
I hope this article will convince you that
</p><ul>
<li>
	asynchronous and concurrency programming with Go channels is easy and enjoyable.
</li>
<li>
	the channel synchronization technique has a wider range of uses
	and has more variations than the synchronization solutions used in some other languages,
	such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the actor model</a>
	and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await">async/await pattern</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that the intention of this article is to show
as many channel use cases as possible.
We should know that channel is not the only concurrency synchronization technique supported in Go,
and for some cases, the channel way may not be the best solution.
Please read <a href="https://www.go101.org/article/concurrent-atomic-operation.html">atomic operations</a> and
<a href="https://www.go101.org/article/concurrent-synchronization-more.html">some other synchronization techniques</a>
for more concurrency synchronization techniques in Go.

<h3>Use Channels as Futures/Promises</h3>

<p>
Futures and promises are used in many other popular languages.
They are often associated with requests and responses.
</p>

<h4>Return receive-only channels as results</h4>

<div>
<p>
In the following example, the values of two arguments of the
<code>sumSquares</code> function call are requested concurrently.
Each of the two channel receive operations will block until
a send operation performs on the corresponding channel.
It takes about three seconds instead of six seconds to return the final result.
</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"time"
	"math/rand"
	"fmt"
)

func longTimeRequest() &lt;-chan int32 {
	r := make(chan int32)

	go func() {
		// Simulate a workload.
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
		r &lt;- rand.Int31n(100)
	}()

	return r
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	a, b := longTimeRequest(), longTimeRequest()
	fmt.Println(sumSquares(&lt;-a, &lt;-b))
}
</code></pre>



</div>

<h4>Pass send-only channels as arguments</h4>

<div>
<p>
Same as the last example,
in the following example, the values of two arguments of the
<code>sumSquares</code> function call are requested concurrently.
Different to the last example, the <code>longTimeRequest</code> function
takes a send-only channel as parameter instead of
returning a receive-only channel result.
</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"time"
	"math/rand"
	"fmt"
)

func longTimeRequest(r chan&lt;- int32)  {
	// Simulate a workload.
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
	r &lt;- rand.Int31n(100)
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	ra, rb := make(chan int32), make(chan int32)
	go longTimeRequest(ra)
	go longTimeRequest(rb)

	fmt.Println(sumSquares(&lt;-ra, &lt;-rb))
}
</code></pre>

<p>

In fact, for the above specified example,
we don't need two channels to transfer results.
Using one channel is okay.

</p><pre><code>...

	// The channel can be buffered or not.
	results := make(chan int32, 2)
	go longTimeRequest(results)
	go longTimeRequest(results)

	fmt.Println(sumSquares(&lt;-results, &lt;-results))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This is kind of data aggregation which will be introduced specially below.
</p>

</div>

<h4>The first response wins</h4>

<div>

<p>
This is the enhancement of the using-only-one-channel variant in the last example.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, a piece of data can be received from several sources to avoid high latencies.
For a lot of factors, the response durations of these sources may vary much.
Even for a specified source, its response durations are also not constant.
To make the response duration as short as possible,
we can send a request to every source in a separated goroutine.
Only the first response will be used, other slower ones will be discarded.
</p>

<p>
Note, if there are <i>N</i> sources, the capacity of
the communication channel must be at least <i>N-1</i>,
to avoid the goroutines corresponding the discarded responses being blocked for ever.
</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"math/rand"
)

func source(c chan&lt;- int32) {
	ra, rb := rand.Int31(), rand.Intn(3) + 1
	// Sleep 1s/2s/3s.
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(rb) * time.Second)
	c &lt;- ra
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	startTime := time.Now()
	// c must be a buffered channel.
	c := make(chan int32, 5)
	for i := 0; i &lt; cap(c); i++ {
		go source(c)
	}
	// Only the first response will be used.
	rnd := &lt;- c
	fmt.Println(time.Since(startTime))
	fmt.Println(rnd)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
There are some other ways to implement the first-response-win use case,
by using the select mechanism and a buffered channel
whose capacity is one. Other ways will be introduced below.
</p>

</div>

<h4>More request-response variants</h4>

<p>
The parameter and result channels can be buffered so that
the response sides won't need to wait for the request sides
to take out the transferred values.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, a request is not guaranteed to be responded back a valid value.
For all kinds of reasons, an error may be returned instead.
For such cases, we can use a struct type like
<code>struct{v T; err error}</code> or a blank interface type
as the channel element type.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, for some reasons, the response may need
a much longer time than the expected to arrive, or will never arrive.
We can use the timeout mechanism introduced below
to handle such circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, a sequence of values may be returned from the response side,
this is kind of the data flow mechanism mentioned later below.
</p>

<h3>Use Channels for Notifications</h3>

<p>
Notifications can be viewed as special requests/responses
in which the responded values are not important.
Generally, we use the blank struct type <code>struct{}</code>
as the element types of the notification channels,
for the size of type <code>struct{}</code> is zero,
hence values of <code>struct{}</code> doesn't consume memory.
</p>

<h4>1-to-1 notification by sending a value to a channel</h4>

<div>
<p>
If there are no values to be received from a channel,
then the next receive operation on the channel will block
until another goroutine sends a value to the channel.
So we can send a value to a channel to notify another goroutine
which is waiting to receive a value from the same channel.
</p><p>

In the following example, the channel <code>done</code>
is used as a signal channel to do notifications.

</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	values := make([]byte, 32 * 1024 * 1024)
	if _, err := rand.Read(values); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	done := make(chan struct{}) // can be buffered or not

	// The sorting goroutine
	go func() {
		sort.Slice(values, func(i, j int) bool {
			return values[i] &lt; values[j]
		})
		// Notify sorting is done.
		done &lt;- struct{}{}
	}()

	// do some other things ...

	&lt;- done // waiting here for notification
	fmt.Println(values[0], values[len(values)-1])
}
</code></pre>


</div>

<h4>1-to-1 notification by receiving a value from a channel</h4>

<div>
<p>
If the value buffer queue of a channel is full
(the buffer queue of an unbuffered channel is always full),
a send operation on the channel will block
until another goroutine receives a value from the channel.
So we can receive a value from a channel to notify another goroutine
which is waiting to send a value to the same channel.
Generally, the channel should be an unbuffered channel.
</p>

<p>
This notification way is used much less common than
the way introduced in the last example.
</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	done := make(chan struct{})
		// The capacity of the signal channel can
		// also be one. If this is true, then a
		// value must be sent to the channel before
		// creating the following goroutine.

	go func() {
		fmt.Print("Hello")
		// Simulate a workload.
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)

		// Receive a value from the done
		// channel, to unblock the second
		// send in main goroutine.
		&lt;- done
	}()

	// Blocked here, wait for a notification.
	done &lt;- struct{}{}
	fmt.Println(" world!")
}
</code></pre>



<p>
In fact, there are no fundamental differences between
receiving or sending values to make notifications.
They can both be summarized as the fasters are notified by the slowers.
</p>

</div>

<h4>N-to-1 and 1-to-N notifications</h4>

<div><p>
By extending the above two use cases a little,
it is easy to do N-to-1 and 1-to-N notifications.

</p><pre><code>package main

import "log"
import "time"

type T = struct{}

func worker(id int, ready &lt;-chan T, done chan&lt;- T) {
	&lt;-ready // block here and wait a notification
	log.Print("Worker#", id, " starts.")
	// Simulate a workload.
	time.Sleep(time.Second * time.Duration(id+1))
	log.Print("Worker#", id, " job done.")
	// Notify the main goroutine (N-to-1),
	done &lt;- T{}
}

func main() {
	log.SetFlags(0)

	ready, done := make(chan T), make(chan T)
	go worker(0, ready, done)
	go worker(1, ready, done)
	go worker(2, ready, done)

	// Simulate an initialization phase.
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 3 / 2)
	// 1-to-N notifications.
	ready &lt;- T{}; ready &lt;- T{}; ready &lt;- T{}
	// Being N-to-1 notified.
	&lt;-done; &lt;-done; &lt;-done
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In fact, the ways to do 1-to-N and N-to-1 notifications introduced
in this sub-section are not used commonly in practice.
In practice, we often use <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> to do N-to-1 notifications,
and we do 1-to-N notifications by close channels.
Please read the next sub-section for details.
</p>
</div>

<h4>Broadcast (1-to-N) notifications by closing a channel</h4>

<div>

<p>
The way to do 1-to-N notifications shown in the last sub-section
is seldom used in practice, for there is a better way.
By making using of the feature that infinite values can be received from
a closed channel, we can close a channel to broadcast notifications.
</p><p>

By the example in the last sub-section,
we can replace the three channel send operations
<code>ready &lt;- struct{}{}</code> in the last example
with one channel close operation <code>close(ready)</code>
to do an 1-to-N notifications.

</p><pre><code>...
	close(ready) // broadcast notifications
...
</code></pre>

<p>
Surely, we can also close a channel to do a 1-to-1 notification.
In fact, this is the most used …</p></div></div></div>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 20, 2020</p>
  <p>I’ve recently read an article criticizing Rust, and, while it made a bunch of good points, I didn’t enjoy it — it was an easy to argue with piece.
In general, I feel that I can’t recommend an article criticizing Rust.
This is a shame — confronting drawbacks is important, and debunking low effort/miss informed attempts at critique sadly inoculates against actually good arguments.</p>
<p>So, here’s my attempt to argue <em>against</em> Rust:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>Not All Programming is Systems Programming</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language.
It offers precise control over data layout and runtime behavior of the code, granting  you maximal performance and flexibility.
Unlike other systems programming languages, it also provides memory safety — buggy programs terminate in a well-defined manner, instead of unleashing (potentially security-sensitive) undefined behavior.</p>
<p>However, in many (most) cases, one doesn’t need ultimate performance or control over hardware resources.
For these situations, modern managed languages like Kotlin or Go offer decent speed, enviable
<a href="https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/system/files/presentation-slides/highperformancemanagedlanguages.pdf">time to performance</a>, and are memory safe by virtue of using a garbage collector for dynamic memory management.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Complexity</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Programmer’s time is valuable, and, if you pick Rust, expect to spend some of it on learning the ropes.
Rust community poured a lot of time into creating high-quality teaching materials, but the Rust language <em>is</em> big.
Even if a Rust implementation would provide value for you, you might not have resources to invest into growing the language expertise.</p>
<p>Rust’s price for improved control is the curse of choice:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Bar</span>         <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Bar</span>     <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>     <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span>     <span>{</span> <span>bar</span><span>:</span> <span>Arc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Kotlin, you write <code>class Foo(val bar: Bar)</code>, and proceed with solving your business problem.
In Rust, there are choices to be made, some important enough to have dedicated syntax.</p>
<p>All this complexity is there for a reason — we don’t know how to create a simpler memory safe low-level language.
But not every task requires a low-level language to solve it.</p>

</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Compile Times</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Compile times are a multiplier for everything.
A program written in a slower to run but faster to compile programming language can be <em>faster</em> to run because the programmer will have more time to optimize!</p>
<p>Rust intentionally picked slow compilers in the <a href="https://research.swtch.com/generic">generics dilemma</a>.
This is not necessary the end of the world (the resulting runtime performance improvements are real), but it does mean that you’ll have to fight tooth and nail for reasonable build times in larger projects.</p>
<p><code>rustc</code> implements what is probably the most advanced <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/queries/incremental-compilation.html">incremental compilation</a> algorithm in production compilers, but this feels a bit like fighting with language compilation model.</p>
<p>Unlike C++, Rust build is not embarrassingly parallel; the amount of parallelism is limited by length of the critical path in the dependency graph.
If you have 40+ cores to compile, this shows.</p>
<p>Rust also lacks an analog for the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl">pimpl</a> idiom, which means that changing a crate requires recompiling (and not just relinking) all of its reverse dependencies.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Maturity</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Five years old, Rust is definitely a young language.
Even though its future looks bright, I will bet more money on “C will be around in ten years” than on “Rust will be around in ten years”
(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a>).
If you are writing software to last decades, you should seriously consider risks associated with picking new technologies.
(But keep in mind that picking Java over Cobol for banking software in 90s retrospectively turned out to be the right choice).</p>
<p>There’s only one complete implementation of Rust — the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/"><code>rustc</code></a> compiler.
The most advanced alternative implementation, <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc"><code>mrustc</code></a>, purposefully omits many static safety checks.
<code>rustc</code> at the moment supports only a single production-ready backend — LLVM.
Hence, its support for CPU architectures is narrower than that of C, which has GCC implementation as well as a number of vendor specific proprietary compilers.</p>
<p>Finally, Rust lacks an official specification.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/">The reference</a> is a work in progress, and does not yet document all the fine implementation details.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Alternatives</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>There are other languages besides Rust in systems programming space, notably, C, C++, and Ada.</p>
<p>Modern C++ provides <a href="https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/">tools</a> and <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">guidelines</a> for improving safety.
There’s even a proposal for a Rust-like <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/docs/Lifetime.pdf">lifetimes</a> mechanism!
Unlike Rust, using these tools does not <em>guarantee</em> the absence of memory safety issues.
However, if you already maintain a large body of C++ code, it makes sense to check if following best practices and using <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">sanitizers</a> helps with security issues.
This is hard, but clearly is easier than rewriting in another language!</p>
<p>If you use C, you can use formal methods to <a href="https://sel4.systems/Info/FAQ/proof.pml">prove</a> the absence of undefined behaviors, or just <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">exhaustively test</a> everything.</p>
<p>Ada is memory safe if you don’t use dynamic memory (never call <code>free</code>).</p>
<p>Rust is an interesting point on the cost/safety curve, but is far from the only one!</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Tooling</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Rust tooling is a bit of a hit and miss.
The baseline tooling, the compiler and the build system
(<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">cargo</a>), are often cited as best in class.</p>
<p>But, for example, some runtime-related tools (most notably, heap profiling) are just absent — it’s hard to reflect on the runtime of the program if there’s no runtime!
Additionally, while IDE support is decent, it is nowhere near the Java-level of reliability.
Automated complex refactors of multi-million line programs are not possible in Rust today.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Integration</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>Whatever the Rust promise is, it’s a fact of life that today’s systems programming world speaks C, and is inhabited by C and C++.
Rust intentionally doesn’t try to mimic these languages — it doesn’t use C++-style classes or C ABI.</p>
<p>That means that integration between the worlds needs explicit bridges.
These are not seamless.
They are <code>unsafe</code>, not always completely zero-cost and need to be synchronized between the languages.
While the general promise of <a href="http://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/how-to-riir/">piece-wise integration</a> holds up and the <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">tooling</a> catches up, there is accidental complexity along the way.</p>
<p>One specific gotcha is that Cargo’s opinionated world view (which <em>is</em> a blessing for pure Rust projects) might make it harder to integrate with a bigger build system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Performance</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>“Using LLVM” is not a universal solution to all performance problems.
While I am not aware of benchmarks comparing performance of C++ and Rust at scale, it’s not to hard to come up with a list of cases where Rust leaves some performance on the table relative to C++.</p>
<p>The biggest one is probably the fact that Rust’s move semantics is based on values (<code>memcpy</code> at the machine code level).
In contrast, C++ semantics uses special references you can steal data from (pointers at the machine code level).
In theory, compiler should be able to see through chain of copies; in practice it often doesn’t: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57077">#57077</a>.
A related problem is the absence of placement new — Rust sometimes need to copy bytes to/from the stack, while C++ can construct the thing in place.</p>
<p>Somewhat amusingly, Rust’s default ABI (which is not stable, to make it as efficient as possible) is sometimes worse than that of C: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26494#issuecomment-619506345">#26494</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while in theory Rust code should be more efficient due to the significantly richer aliasing information, enabling aliasing-related optimizations triggers LLVM bugs and miscompilations: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878">#54878</a>.</p>
<p>But, to reiterate, these are cherry-picked examples, sometimes the field is tilted the other way.
For example, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHIkrotSwcc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1261">has a performance problem</a> which Rust’s <code>Box</code> lacks.</p>
<p>A potentially bigger issue is that Rust, with its definition time checked generics, is less expressive than C++.
So, some C++ <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Expression_templates">template tricks</a> for high performance are not expressible in Rust using a nice syntax.</p>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Meaning of Unsafe</dt>
<dd>
<div>
<div>
<p>An idea which is even more core to Rust than ownership &amp; borrowing is perhaps that of <code>unsafe</code> boundary.
That, by delineating all dangerous operations behind <code>unsafe</code> blocks and functions and insisting on providing a safe higher-level interface to them, it is possible to create a system which is both</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sound (non-<code>unsafe</code> code can’t cause undefined behavior),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and modular (different <code>unsafe</code> blocks can be checked separately).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>It’s pretty clear that the promise works out in practice: <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/trophy-case">fuzzing Rust code</a> unearths panics, not buffer overruns.</p>
<p>But the theoretical outlook is not as rosy.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, there’s no definition of Rust memory model, so it is impossible to formally check if a given unsafe block is valid or not.
There’s informal definition of “things rustc does or might rely on” and in in-progress <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">runtime verifier</a>, but the actual model is in flux.
So there might be some <code>unsafe</code> code somewhere which works OK in practice today, might be declared invalid tomorrow, and broken by a new compiler optimization next year.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, there’s also an observation that <code>unsafe</code> blocks are not, in fact, modular.
Sufficiently powerful <code>unsafe</code> blocks can, in effect, extend the language.
Two such extensions might be fine in isolation, but lead to undefined behavior if used simultaneously:
<a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/10/02/observational-equivalence-and-unsafe-code/">Observational equivalence and unsafe code</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Here are some thing I’ve deliberately omitted from the list:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economics (“it’s harder to hire Rust programmers”) — I feel that the “maturity” section captures the essence of it which is not reducible to chicken and egg problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies (“stdlib is too small / everything has too many deps”) — given how good Cargo and the relevant parts of the language are, I personally don’t see this as a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic linking (“Rust should have stable ABI”) — I don’t think this is a strong argument. Monomorphization is pretty fundamentally incompatible with dynamic linking and there’s C ABI if you really need to. I do think that the situation here can be improved, <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/a-stable-modular-abi-for-rust/12347/10?u=matklad">but I don’t think that improvement needs to be Rust-specific</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>I updated all the packages on my system with <code>pacman -Syyu</code>. Didn’t think much of it at the time.</p>
<p>Later in the day my computer froze when using bash to execute a python script I was developing (whoops).</p>
<p>After waiting a minute to see if my computer would recover, I initiated force shutdown.</p>
<p>I started up my computer as normal, but this time I couldn’t login! It was disheartening to be shown <code>Password Incorrect</code> over and over. Caps lock is off, check. Try a couple keyboards, check.</p>

<p>At first I was scared that the script I ran had somehow changed my password. Off to the newbie corner I go :). Uh oh, I hadn’t read the patch notes. Turns out updates to <code>PAM</code> and <code>PAMBASE</code> might prevent login. Other people were having the same problem, all I had to do was login with rescue mode!</p>
<p>I follow the instructions to boot rescue mode. i.e. pressing <code>e</code> on the grub screen to edit the boot parameters and adding the kernel option <code>systemd.unit=rescue.target</code>. I find myself in a terminal prompted for my root password; what’s my root password again? This can’t be good. How can I possibly login without my root password?!</p>
<p>Back to the newbie forums. Luckily I find someone with a similar problem. He was having trouble logging into rescue mode because he had never set the root password in the first place. Turns out the solution is to reset your root password without knowing your root password. I couldn’t believe how easy the process was.</p>
<p>Instead of appending <code>systemd.unit=rescue.target</code> to the kernel params, I appended <code>init=/bin/bash</code>. This tells the computer to run <code>/bin/bash</code> as init rather than the system init and puts you into a root shell without being prompted for a password. Your root file system is mounted as read-only now, so the first step is to mount it as read/write: <code>mount -n -o remount,rw /</code>. Then use <code>passwd</code> to create a new password for the root user, <code>reboot -f</code>, and you are good to go!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to “fix” this, lock GRUB and your BIOS with a password and put your hard disk first in boot order. If someone else has physical access and can put the (non-encrypted) hard disk into another computer, you have lost anyway</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that I was able to successfully boot into rescue mode and fix the problems with PAM. I did the following:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> /etc/pam.d/
mv system-login system-login.backup
mv system-login.pacnew system-login
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>One final reboot to the computer, and here I am!</p>

<p>I was late for my 10 oclock shutdown because of this, but thank god I’m back. This could have been quite a disaster; I’ll be backing up my pc tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is the first time I’ve ever had a “breaking change” with manjaro, but it was my fault and could have been prevented by reading the update notes. Live and learn.</p>

	<strong><span>Technical highlight:&nbsp;Real time online gaming with the NES</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Super Tilt Bro. is not a retro-game. It always tried to be a modern game on retro hardware, and modern games are playable online!
</p>

<p>
	We "simply" put a WiFi chipset in the cartridge, and let's rock! New millennium, here we come!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	<span>Challenges of online gaming</span>
</p>

<p>
	Writing a game to be played online is not an easy task. At any time, we have to ensure that both players see the same scene. When the game is fast-paced, some milliseconds of ping can make a big difference.
</p>

<p>
	Let's assume Alice is playing against Bob. Bob unleashed his super-attack, and Alice dodged it on the last frame, EPIC! But, there is a ping of 20 milliseconds between Alice and Bob's houses (typical), and a frame lasts 16 milliseconds. Alice did actually dodge on time, so her game shows her character ready for a deadly counter-strike. Now, the information of Alice's epic dodge took 20 milliseconds to reach Bob's home, so Bob sees that Alice dodged too late, taking heavy damage. That's a typical case of desynchronization: the two players see a completely different outcome of their fight.
</p>

<p>
	<span><img alt="spacer.png" data-ratio="58.62" height="425" width="725" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qYiVEbt.png" src="https://www.videogamesage.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png"></span><br><span>Alice and Bob's different timelines. Everybody wins!</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The rollback netcode</span>
</p>

<p>
	Super Tilt Bro. is based on a rollback netcode. It does not wait to know opponent's inputs, it guesses it. When inputs finally come, the game discovers if its guess was right or wrong. A right guess is good. If the guess was wrong, the game rollbacks it's scene taking real inputs instead of guessed ones.
</p>

<p>
	What does it mean for the epic fight between Alice and Bob? Alice still dodges on time, her game shows it without problem. Bob's game begins to guess that Alice did not dodge (that was an epic dodge like we rarely see), so it begins to show the attack hitting. Then, less than 20 milliseconds after, the information arrives. The game rollbacks, Alice was never hit. There will typically be one frame of flicker (Alice is hit one frame, has dodged the next), but finally both players see the same action, and can continue to fight.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="spacer.png" data-ratio="72.41" height="525" width="725" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/aPjRaAe.png" src="https://www.videogamesage.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png"><br><span>The rollback engine, casually rewriting the past.</span>
</p>

<p>
	The guessing algorithm is super simple. It always guesses that nothing changed, no button was released nor pressed. For a game running at 60 FPS, even for a nervous player doing six inputs per second, this simple algorithm is right 90% of the time.
</p>

<p>
	<span>Adding some input lag</span>
</p>

<p>
	Another trick is to delay inputs while sending them immediately over the network. Let's say we artificially delay all inputs by four frames. If an input takes less than four frames to be transmitted from a player to another, rollback is not even necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Getting back to the game between Alice and Bob, but with an input lag of four frames. When Alice inputs the dodge on the last possible frame, it has no immediate effect, so she is hit hard. One or two frames later, Bob receives the network packet with the dodge input, it has not yet had any effect. Both players see the same action: Alice took the hit. It is less epic, but at least everybody sees the same thing and there is no visual glitch.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="spacer.png" data-ratio="58.62" height="425" width="725" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/BV4ZBXG.png" src="https://www.videogamesage.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png"><br>
	Input-lag: glitch-less, but frustrating at times.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, both approaches can be used together. That's what Super Tilt Bro. does. There is a little bit of input lag, which should be sufficient in most cases. In case of a latency spike the input lag may not be enough, the rollback code saves the day ensuring minimal glitch. In a nutshell, rollback makes your opponent teleport at the beginning of a move, input lag makes your character slow to react, a balance between both has to be found.
</p>

<p>
	<span>Some other implementations</span>
</p>

<p>
	All that is good, now you know how the Super Tilt Bro.'s netcode mitigates internet's latency. Most game developers just never openly discuss their netcode, while it is extremely interesting to see different approaches. Here are some known ones.
</p>

<p>
	Super Smash Bros, the direct inspiration for Super Tilt Bro. does not do the same thing. There is no rollback at all in the original series, instead the game slows down or even freezes waiting for inputs. It can be easily seen by playing on an unstable connection, the game will regularly freeze. To limit the impact of these slow downs, the input lag seems dynamic. (Yes, sorry for that "seem", most available info is reverse engineered or outright guessed.) We know for sure that Super Smash Bros Brawl rates your connection and attributes it an input lag that can vary from 3 frames for the best to 15 frames for the worst. People trying to measure input lag in Super Smash Bros Ultimate failed with online mode, the input lag was too varying. Maybe Ultimate is adjusting dynamically input lag for each player during the game.
</p>

<p>
	The approach of avoiding rollbacks and freezing the game has its benefits and drawbacks. First, it is really easy to implement, the only special case to handle is to wait for the needed information to be available. As a side effect, it requires very little overhead for the CPU and memory. The game engine does not have to be able to rollback from a previous point in time, the game can just run forward, forgetting anything that happened on previous frames. The effect on laggy connections is a freeze, while with a rollback netcode characters may teleport around on laggy connections. It is a matter of preference, a freeze is more "understandable", while a slight teleport is more smooth to play. The biggest problem is competitive play. Even at a moderate level, players train their combo, learning to execute moves with very precise timing (even frame-perfect sometimes). If the game slows down, freezes or changes the input lag in the middle of a frame-perfect combo, it messes it up, making it fail while player's execution is perfect. Finally, freezes must be avoided, it is not an option. So the player cannot be offered the choice to configure its input lag, it has to be conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Another well-known solution is GGPO. It is a standalone rollback netcode made to be used by developers on their own game. It is especially popular in arcade emulation, and is the solution of choice of Skull Girls (which is known to have a good netcode.) GGPO is a rollback engine, their documentation does not mention input lag, but Skull Girls allows it to be configured to a fixed number of frames. This way the player can balance himself between more rollbacks or more input lag.
</p>

<p>
	It is a lot like the Super Tilt Bro.'s netcode. The good thing is that input lag is fixed and constant for an entire game. You can still perform your frame-perfect combos. The biggest problem is when there is a big latency spike, characters will teleport around for a while until the game successfully re-synchronize itself with the other player. This kind of action is really confusing for the player. Also, the game engine has to take save-states and manage it to be able to rollback, putting pressure on the CPU and memory.
</p>

<p>
	All these modern implementations have something in common: they are peer-to-peer. Avoiding packets to transit by a server noticeably reduces latency. That's a really cool solution. Super Tilt Bro., however, is server based, let's see why.
</p>

<p>
	<span>Super Tilt Bro.'s game server</span>
</p>

<p>
	We saw that peer-to-peer is the best model for online versus fighting. Super Tilt Bro. does not have this luxury. We also saw that rollback netcodes are costly for the CPU as the game has to be able to rollback, and the RAM because it has to store its old states. The NES runs with a 8-bit CPU at 1.5 Mhz and 2 KB of RAM. It is really far from modern systems. Implementing the rollback system entirely on the NES would be very limiting, most resources would be allocated to it at the expense of gameplay. The server is here to help.
</p>

<p>
	Remember Alice and Bob? With the Super Tilt Bro.'s protocol, when Alice presses a button the game only sends the state of the gamepad and a timestamp to the server. The server knows the game, it is able to simulate frames, and compute the game's state at any point. Based on this knowledge and Alice's input, the server computes the state of the game at the frame of Alice's input, then sends all that to Bob. Bob receives the timestamp, Alice's input and a full game state. If input lag did its work, the game state can be ignored. If a rollback is needed, Bob's NES can use the state received from the server. Bob's NES does not have to manage a list of game states, the server generates it when needed, removing almost all pressure on the limited NES memory.
</p>

<p>
	The server can also help with CPU budget. Let's say there is always a minimum of two frames of delay between Alice and Bob. When receiving Alice's input, instead of computing the state at the time of the input, the server can compute the state two frames after. The server is actually predicting the future, avoiding Bob's NES to do it itself. Of course a full rollback engine has to also be implemented in the server, but can help a lot with big latencies. Currently, Super Tilt Bro. is able to rollback only three frames of gameplay before running out of time. The server doing the rollback for one or two frames can help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	<span>UDP vs TCP... And web browsers</span>
</p>

<p>
	There are two big, omnipresent protocols on the internet: UDP and TCP. TCP is the most common one, it allows a computer to connect to another and send data. In TCP land, we don't lose data, and data is received in the same order as it was sent. Most of the internet is constructed on TCP, it is simple to use. UDP is a more lightweight protocol. In UDP's world, when we send a packet, the only sure thing is that we sent it. The packet may be randomly lost, or arrive before a packet sent earlier. So, TCP is a better protocol, right? No. Sadly, TCP's magic has a cost.
</p>

<p>
	In Super Tilt Bro.'s protocol we don't care a lot about lost packets. A message from the server to a client contains a full game state. A recent message …</p></div></div>

<p>Everyone needs something fun to do in their spare time. And digging deep into curl internals is mighty fun!</p>



<p>One of the things I do in curl every now and then is to run a few typical command lines and count how much memory is allocated and how many memory allocation calls that are made. This is good project hygiene and is a basic check that we didn’t accidentally slip in a malloc/free sequence in the transfer path or something.</p>



<p>We have extensive memory checks for leaks etc in the test suite so I’m not worried about that. Those things we detect and fix immediately, even when the leaks occur in error paths – thanks to our fancy “torture tests” that do error injections.</p>



<p>The amount of memory needed or number of mallocs used is more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog problem</a>. We add one now, then another months later and a third the following year. Each added malloc call is motivated within the scope of that particular change. But taken all together, does the pattern of memory use make sense? Can we make it better?</p>



<h2>How?</h2>



<p>Now this is easy because when we build curl debug enabled, we have a fancy logging system (we call it <em>memdebug</em>) that logs all calls to “fallible” system functions so after the test is completed we can just easily grep for them and count. It also logs the exact source code and line number.</p>



<pre>cd tests
./runtests -n [number]
egrep -c 'alloc|strdup' log/memdump</pre>



<h2>Let’s start</h2>



<p>Let me start out with a look at the history and how many allocations (calloc, malloc, realloc or strdup) we do to complete test 103. The reason I picked 103 is somewhat random, but I wanted to look at FTP and this test happens to do an “active” transfer of content and makes a total of 10 FTP commands in the process.</p>



<p>The reason I decided to take a closer look at FTP this time is because I fixed an issue in the main ftp source code file the other day and that made me remember the <code>Curl_pp_send()</code> function we have. It is the function that sends FTP commands (and IMAP, SMTP and POP3 commands too, the family of protocols we refer to as the “ping pong protocols” internally because of their command-response nature and that’s why it has “pp” in the name).</p>



<p>When I reviewed the function now with my malloc police hat on, I noticed how it made two calls to aprintf(). Our printf version that returns a freshly malloced area – which can even cause several reallocs in the worst case. But this meant <em>at least </em>two mallocs per issued command. That’s a bit unnecessary, isn’t it?</p>



<h2>What about a few older versions</h2>



<p>I picked a few random older versions, checked them out from git, built them and counted the number of allocs they did for test 103:</p>



<pre>7.52.1: 141<br>7.68.0: 134<br>7.70.0: 137<br>7.72.0: 123</pre>



<p>It’s been up but it has gone down too. Nothing alarming, Is that a good amount or a bad amount? We shall see…</p>



<h2>Cleanup step one</h2>



<p>The function gets printf style arguments and sends them to the server. The sent command also needs to append CRLF to the data. It was easy to make sure the CRLF appending wouldn’t need an extra malloc. That was just sloppy of us to have there in the first place. Instead of mallocing the new printf format string with CRLF appended, it could use one in a stack based buffer. I landed that as a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0548ecaf6ac6fd8d81d63048d09ece8dbb715666">first commit</a>.</p>



<p>This trimmed off 10 mallocs for test 103.</p>



<h2>Step two, bump it up a notch</h2>



<p>The remaining malloc allocated the memory block for protocol content to send. It can be up to several kilobytes but is usually just a few bytes. It gets allocated in case it needs to be held on to if the entire thing cannot be sent off over the wire immediately. Remember, curl is non-blocking internally so it cannot just sit waiting for the data to get transferred.</p>



<p>I switched the malloc’ed buffer to instead use a ‘dynbuf’. That’s our internal “dynamic buffer” system that was <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c568af1e3b8ac6e4e2d883888#diff-8990ac09ce8abcb4f5e90a8f210ae11c">introduced earlier this year</a> and that we’re gradually switching all internals over to use instead of doing “custom” buffer management in various places. <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/DYNBUF.md">The internal API for dynbuf is documented here</a>.</p>



<p>The internal API <code>Curl_dyn_addf()</code> adds a printf()-style string at the end of a “dynbuf”, and it seemed perfectly suitable to use here. I only needed to provide a <code>vprintf()</code> alternative since the printf() format was already received by <code>Curl_pp_sendf()</code>… I created <code>Curl_dyn_vaddf()</code> for this.</p>



<p>This single dynbuf is kept for the entire transfer so that it can be reused for subsequent commands and grow only if needed. Usually the initial 32 bytes malloc should be sufficient for all commands.</p>



<h2>Not good enough</h2>



<p>It didn’t help!</p>



<p>Counting the mallocs showed me with brutal clarity that my job wasn’t done there. Having dug this deep already I wasn’t ready to give this up just yet…</p>



<p>Why? Because <code>Curl_dyn_addf()</code> was still doing a separate alloc of the printf string that it then appended to the dynamic buffer. But okay, having <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/mprintf.c">our own printf() implementation</a> in the code has its perks.</p>



<h2>Add a printf() string without extra malloc</h2>



<p>Back in <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ed35d6590e72c23c568af1e3b8ac6e4e2d883888#diff-8990ac09ce8abcb4f5e90a8f210ae11c">May 2020</a> when I introduced this dynbuf thing, I converted the aprintf() code over to use dynbuf to truly unify our use of dynamically growing buffers. That was a main point with it after all.</p>



<p>As all the separate individual pieces I needed for this next step were already there, all I had to do was to add a new entry point to the printf() code that would accept a dynbuf as input and write directly into that (and grow it if needed), and then use that new function (<code>Curl_dyn_vprintf</code>) from the Curl_dyn_addf().</p>



<p>Phew. Now let’s see what we get…</p>



<p>There are 10 FTP commands that previously did 2 mallocs each: 20 mallocs were spent  in this function when test 103 was executed. Now we are down to the ideal case of one alloc in there for the entire transfer.</p>



<h2>Test 103 after polish</h2>



<p>The code right now in master (to eventually get released as 7.73.0 in a few weeks), now shows <strong>a total of 104 allocations</strong>. Down from 123 in the previous release, which not entirely surprising is 19 fewer and thus perfectly matching the logic above.</p>



<p>All tests and CI ran fine. <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/675eeb1c941706070381faaad8ee1a5d75cff4a4">I merged it</a>. This is a change that benefits all transfers done with any of the “ping pong protocols”. And it also makes the code easier to understand!</p>



<p>Compared to curl 7.52.1, this is a 26% reduction in number of allocation; pretty good, but even compared to 7.72.0 it is still a 15% reduction.</p>



<h2>More?</h2>



<p>There is always more to do, but there’s also a question of diminishing returns. I will continue to look at curl’s memory use going forward too and make sure everything is motivated and reasonable. At least every once in a while.</p>



<p>I have some additional ideas for further improvements in the memory use area to look into. We’ll see if they pan out…</p>



<p>Don’t count on me to blog about every such finding with this level of detail! If you want to make sure you don’t miss any of these fine-tunes in the future, follow <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">the curl github repo</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>In his bestselling book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">Sapiens</a>, Yuval Harari argues that humans became the dominating species of planet earth because we are the only animal that can cooperate in large numbers. This, he claims, is due to humans’ ability to believe in purely imaginative things and concepts. A company like Google, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> exist. Sure, there’s the Google.com website and physical Google offices with real Google employees – but the idea of Google as a company is just a fictional concept. It only exists because multiple people believe in it. The same is true for legal systems, nations, religion or money. Every large human cooperation system is based on a fictional idea that only lives in our collective minds.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qanon.gif" media="min-width: 600px">What Harari doesn’t discuss in his book is the extreme other end of this cognitive ability: Conspiracy theories. I’ve been fascinated by <a href="https://reallifemag.com/this-is-not-a-game/">Jon Glover’s recent essay on QAnon</a>, in which he compares conspiracy theorizing to alternate-reality games. Participating in QAnon conspiracies, he says, feels like playing a real-life multiplayer game based on secret insider knowledge.</p>



<p>Social media has made conspiracy theorizing so addictive and immersive that the line between story and reality can become incredibly blurry. </p>



<p><i>“A lot of these groups are like cults […] They have beliefs that border on religiosity … And when you contradict them, it’s like telling them Jesus isn’t real.”</i></p>



<p>The religion analogy is interesting because it’s a perfect example of why fact checking as a countermeasure is useless. <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-factcheck/with-fact-checks-twitter-takes-on-a-new-kind-of-task-idUSKBN2360U0?il=0">co</a> have all introduced fact checks and fake news labels to combat conspiracy theories. It’s naive to think that they will work.</p>



<p>Think about it: Science (which, you could argue, is also a form of fact checking) has been around for centuries trying to debunk most religious beliefs – and yet religion still plays a major role in Western society. If entire education systems teaching millions of people about science haven’t worked, why do you think adding a small fact check disclaimer below a YouTube video would?</p>



<p>In fact – as you would expect from a perfect alternate-reality game – fact checks (and how to circumvent them) have <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1303630697567928320">actually long been part of the game</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that science is also just another belief system. We laugh about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">flat earthers</a>, but how many people can actually explain why the world is round in a scientifically correct way? Most of us don’t <em>know</em> science, we <em>believe</em> in science.</p>



<center><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/reality.gif"></center>



<p>What should give us hope though is the fact that many people believe in *both* science and religion despite their contradictions. This means that multiple realities can co-exist even when they are at odds with each other.</p>



<p>We don’t live in just one reality – we switch between different realities (and play different characters within them). It’s a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a>, where guests can explore different theme parks: Westworld, Shogunworld, Warworld, etc.</p>



<p>Similar to Westworld, it’s increasingly becoming more difficult to distinguish between what’s real and what isn’t. As Aaron Z. Lewis points out in his brilliant essay <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">You Can Handle the Post-Truth</a>, we have created a fragmented reality with hyper-realistic CGI influencers, bots, deepfakes, AI pretending to be humans and humans pretending to be AI. We don’t live in a single timeline with a single history, but in a variety of “<em>contradictory reality bubbles</em>“.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/narrativeviolations.png"></p><p>Bruno Maçães paints a similar picture in his excellent book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52914599-history-has-begun">History Has Begun</a>. America, he believes, is in the process of transforming into a new, post-liberal society, distinct from current Western civilization. It’s a society that has not only been heavily shaped by television but one where reality and fantasy overlap.</p>



<p>This transformation has been in the making for a while: Kennedy had the aura of a movie star and leveraged his image through the medium of television. Nixon created the first political soap opera with the Watergate scandal. And with Reagan an actual movie star moved into the White House.</p>



<p>Trump is the ultimate culmination of this trend. His entire presidency feels scripted. His tweets end with <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265819308699070464?lang=en">cliffhangers</a>. A House of Cards screenwriter would not have been able to come up with a better story.</p>



<p>Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger used the social capital and entertainment skills they acquired as actors to appear more likable and competent as politicians, but at least they tried to be politicians. Trump, on the other hand, uses politics as another stage for his acting performance.</p>



<p><em>“Americans see the world as an action movie”</em> Maçães writes. I think this became especially apparent during the current covid-19 crisis and the most recent wildfires in California. People in my social media timelines seemed only superficially worried. Instead, their posts contained an underlying sense of excitement about real life finally catching up with the science fiction aesthetics of Blade Runner and Akira.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is Hollywood’s greatest achievement: It gets us excited about our dystopian future. The world might be ending, but at least it’s an ending that’s entertaining to watch.</p>



<p><iframe width="100%" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_m9TUP_t_Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>If Hollywood created the fantasy worlds that reality is catching up with today, who is creating the fantasy worlds of tomorrow?</p>



<p>Maçães thinks the answer is Silicon Valley, which he describes as <em>“a fantasy land where engineering talent and capital come together to power the serious project of creating new worlds out of nothing”</em>. It’s one of the most idiosyncratic descriptions of how startups work that I have read. VCs are the new Hollywood studios; founders are the directors and actors.</p>



<p>A founder’s job is essentially to create the most compelling narrative of what their company will look like in 10 to 20 years time. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">It’s not lying, it’s telling pre-truths</a>. Being contrarian just means that you came up with a novel fantasy plot no one else had thought of yet.</p>



<p>Sometimes founders are able to re-create the fantasy narratives of their pitch decks. Sometimes you end up with Theranos.</p>



<p>And even when you do end up with Theranos, at least you get material for an exciting new Netflix series. Perhaps VCs should buy the movie rights to the startups they invest in as a hedge against their biggest portfolio failures?</p>



<p>The concept of the tech industry as a creator of fantasy worlds immediately reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cutler_max">Max</a> recently. His theory is that it’s not the lack of tech talent or venture capital that explains why Europe hasn’t been able to create a tech ecosystem on par with the US. It’s the absence of religiosity that has kept Europe from creating its own Google or Facebook. The US is able to create larger companies because it’s able to believe in larger and more ambitious narratives.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/escher.png"></p><p>Silicon Valley is not just creating new fantasy worlds, it is building tools that allow others to create their own fantasy worlds. Enter social media.</p>



<p>If TV has taught us to think of ourselves as characters in the story of our lives, then social media has allowed us to actually write and edit the script and build fictional characters. Social media is essentially the democratization of virtual world building.</p>



<p>As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook are just massive virtual status arenas that allow us to build social capital through signaling. Some of that social capital might be built on top of real stories and actual achievements, but most of it is not based on reality. Every time you are applying an Instagram filter, you are already changing reality.</p>



<p>It’s not just that we bend reality in our social media narratives, we also play different characters. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc">Chris Poole already pointed out</a> years ago, we all have multiple (online) identities. There is not just one reflection of yourself – identity is prismatic. Twitter-Julian (armchair intellectual) is not the same as Instagram-Julian (hobby photographer) or Facebook-Julian (high-school drinking buddy). Google Circles and Facebook Lists always got this wrong: They let us change who we shared <em>with</em>, but not who we shared <em>as</em>.</p>



<p>This is why social networking is not a winner-take-all market. We need different channels for our different, contradicting online personas. </p>



<p>The problem is not that we live in multiple realities or that these realities are sometimes at odds with each other. What’s problematic is that we sometimes get so immersed in one virtual world, that we forget about all the other realities – which brings us back to the problem of online conspiracies.</p>



<p>In Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Dom Cobb uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo">a spinning tractricoid top that tells him if he is awake or still dreaming</a>. You can think of the mechanisms I describe in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/">Proof of X</a> as social media’s equivalent of the spinning top. As <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/you-can-rent-a-grounded-private-jet-to-take-instagram-photos.html">influencers rent grounded private jets</a> to pretend living a billionaire lifestyle, social networks introduce new proof-of-work hurdles to make sure our status games remain grounded in truth. Proof of reality.</p>



<p>It feels like some of the new virtual realities we have created need more than that. A kill switch that automatically brings us back to base reality.</p>



<p>So if you have reached this point of my essay, perhaps now would be a good time to close your browser window and enjoy real life. Or at least <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">the closest simulation you have thereof</a>. </p>

September 25, 2020 | https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>For one of my game programming classes at Ohio State I decided to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity-Component-System (ECS)</a>. A widely used pattern in game design, an ECS allows for a simpler gameobject pattern then polymorphism would. The reasons for this are discussed elsewhere<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, this blog post is solely for implementation.</p>
<h2>Component</h2>
<p>I'm covering Components before Entities as this is where the entire game is implemented.Components describe any behavior shared between many Entities. Examples include <code>Transform</code>, <code>Collider</code>, <code>Sprite</code>, <code>Script</code>, etc. I modelled my implemetation off of the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html">Unity</a> style of ECS, as that's what many game programmers are used to. The implementation of the <code>Component</code> base class is exceedingly simple:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Component</span>
{
    <span>public</span> Entity entity;

    <span><span>public</span> <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>Update</span>(<span>GameTime gameTime</span>)</span> { }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each component type subclasses <code>Component</code>. I'll include a <code>Transform</code> type below as an example:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Transform</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    <span>public</span> Vector2 position = Vector2.Zero;
    <span>public</span> Vector2 scale = Vector2.Zero;
    <span>public</span> <span>float</span> layerDepth = <span>0</span>;
    <span>public</span> <span>float</span> rotation = <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Entity</h2>
<p>Entities are the class for any given "thing" in the scene. Your player, their weapon, the enemies, the walls, all are "entities" in this model. My <code>Entity</code> class starts with the properties below:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> ID { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }

    List&lt;Component&gt; components = <span>new</span> List&lt;Component&gt;();

    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The ID could be a string or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>, but an <code>int</code> will work just fine for the 2D sprite-based game I'm making in this class. The <code>components</code> property references all the behaviors an entity has. Let's add some methods to this class to add a <code>Component</code> to the <code>Entity</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span>
{
    ... 

    <span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>AddComponent</span>(<span>Component component</span>)</span>
    {
        components.Add(component);
        component.entity = <span>this</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This method is pretty self-explanatory, the tricky (generics) part is what comes next- retrieving components. But first, why would we need to retrieve components?</p>
<h3>Sidebar: Example Character Entity</h3>
<p>If we are implementing a normal character, we'd subclass the <code>Entity</code> class and register components on it like so:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyAwesomeCharacter</span> : <span>Entity</span> 
{
    <span><span>public</span> <span>MyAwesomeCharacter</span>(<span>Texture2D tex</span>)</span> 
    {
        
        Transform transform = <span>new</span> Transform();
        transform.position = <span>new</span> Vector2(<span>100</span>, <span>100</span>);
        AddComponent(transform);

        
        Sprite sprite = <span>new</span> Sprite();
        sprite.texture = tex;
        AddComponent(sprite); 
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now we have a character that stores both a <code>Sprite</code> and a <code>Transform</code>. Now wouldn't it be cool if the <code>Sprite</code> could know where on the screen to draw by accessing the value of <code>Transform</code>? This is where generics come in.</p>
<h3>Retrieving Components</h3>
<p>In our implementation of the <code>Sprite</code> component above, we'd like to be able to access the values of the attached Entity's <code>Transform</code> component. It is pertinent to mention that each <code>Entity</code> should have <em>only one of each type</em> of <code>Component</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Sprite</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    Texture2D texture;

    <span><span>public</span> <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>Update</span>(<span><span>float</span> gameTime</span>)</span> {
        
        Transform t = entity.GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;();
        GameEngine.DrawSprite(texture, t.position); 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>How would we implement this generic <code>GetComponent</code> call? It's actually not too bad using C# <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/">generics</a>. See below:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span>
{
    ... 

    <span><span>public</span> T <span>GetComponent</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt;(<span></span>) <span>where</span> T : Component</span>
    {
        <span>foreach</span> (Component component <span>in</span> components)
        {
            <span>if</span> (component.GetType().Equals(<span>typeof</span>(T)))
            {
                <span>return</span> (T)component;
            }
        }
        <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This just magically <em>works</em>. Well, it's not magic, C# just has nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)">reflection</a> capabilities built in. This will allow <em>any component</em> to access <em>any other component</em> on the same Entity.</p>
<h3>Component Conclusion</h3>
<p>We now have a class <code>Component</code> that we can use to make endless reusable components that may be useful for our entities, and these components can interact with each other seamlessly.</p>
<h2>System</h2>
<p>There's one more part of ECS- the S. All game run in what's called a <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">game loop</a>, usually implemented as some sort of infinite while loop that runs every frame, updating the entire game logic then rendering to the screen. The <code>System</code> in ECS refers loosely to calling <code>Update</code> on each and every <code>Component</code> on each <code>Entity</code> in the scene. We could simply do the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>foreach</span>(Entity entity <span>in</span> scene) 
{
    <span>foreach</span>(Component component <span>in</span> entity.components)
    {
        component.Update(deltaTime)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but is <em>slow</em>. You of course won't run into any issues with this in a small game with 1000 objects or so but on a larger project with a couple extra orders of magnitude and this will begin to crawl.</p>
<h3>Sidebar: CPU Cache Misses</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#Cache_miss">cache miss</a> can occur when the data referenced by an instruction isn't found in the CPU cache, so it has to be loaded from memory (this is sloooow). There are plenty<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> of excellent presentations on why this is bad and how to address this issue, but the jist of it is that we need to store each type of <code>Component</code> in its own system. For example, when processing many collider components, the CPU can have them all in cache at once, instead of having the whole entity.</p>
<h3>System Class</h3>
<p>To address the performance concerns of an ECS, we can do some object-oriented trickery. I created a <code>BaseSystem</code> class then subclassed said class for each type of <code>Component</code> I wish to support.</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; <span>where</span> <span>T</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    <span><span>protected</span> <span>static</span> <span>List</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; components</span> = <span>new</span> List&lt;T&gt;();

    <span><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Register</span>(<span>T component</span>)</span>
    {
        components.Add(component);
    }

    <span><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Update</span>(<span>GameTime gameTime</span>)</span>
    {
        <span>foreach</span> (T component <span>in</span> components)
        {
            component.Update(gameTime);
        }
    }
}

<span>class</span> <span>TransformSystem</span> : <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>Transform</span>&gt; { }
<span>class</span> <span>SpriteSystem</span> : <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>Sprite</span>&gt; { }
<span>class</span> <span>ColliderSystem</span> : <span>BaseSystem</span>&lt;<span>Collider</span>&gt; { }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we make a change to our component implementations:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Transform</span> : <span>Component</span>
{
    ... 

    <span><span>public</span> <span>Transform</span>(<span></span>)</span> {
        TransformSystem.Register(<span>this</span>);
    }

    ... 
}
</code></pre>
<p>... we've allowed for the CPU to pull only the components it is processing. In our main game loop we can run the following for any types of components we are using:</p>
<pre><code>TransformSystem.Update(gameTime);
SpriteSystem.Update(gameTime);
ColliderSystem.Update(gameTime);
</code></pre>
<p>This will still update all our components but with better performance then the naive solution. As an added benefit, we can now be sure we update all colliders before we render all sprites, and ensure other gameplay-critical orderings remain intact.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>The complete code for this Entity-Component-System can be found on <a href="https://github.com/MH15/blog-examples/tree/master/ecs">Github</a>.
Please let me know if there's anything I can do to improve this ECS implementation!</p>

<p><span>On day two of the Virtual </span><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/"><span>Heidelberg Laureate Forum</span></a><span> (HLF) 2020, Robert Endre Tarjan and Donald Ervin Knuth engaged in a freewheeling conversation about mathematics, computer science, and art.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/laureate/donald-ervin-knuth.html"><span>Donald Knuth</span></a><span> was the 1974 </span><a href="https://amturing.acm.org/"><span>ACM A.M. Turing Award</span></a><span> winner for “for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his contributions to the “art of computer programming” through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title,” while </span><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/laureate/robert-endre-tarjan.html"><span>Robert Tarjan</span></a><span>, won the </span><a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/rolf-nevanlinna-prize"><span>Nevanlinna Prize</span></a><span> in 1982 “for devising near-optimal algorithms for many graph-theoretic and geometric problems for the development and exploitation of data structures supporting efficient algorithms, and for contributing several algorithmic analyses of striking profundity and elegance” and the Turing Award in 1986 “with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopcroft"><span>John E. Hopcroft</span></a><span>, for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures.”</span></p>
<p><span>Tarjan was a student of Knuth’s at Stanford, and their history together was on display in their dynamic banter. The conversation produced a number of entertaining anecdotes, such as Knuth’s concern for Tarjan’s health when he was an assistant professor. Knuth said of Tarjan, “as I sort of remember…I was very worried about you because you were proving theorems in your head as you were driving the freeways and I was afraid you would get into a wreck.” Remember kids, don’t do math and drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth also discussed his time as the manager of the </span><a href="https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Case_Institute_of_Technology"><span>Case Institute of Technology</span></a><span> basketball team while he was an undergraduate. During his junior year he created a process to keep better statistics on each basketball player during practices and games. Then, using punch cards, he fed this data into an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650"><span>IBM 650</span></a><span> to generate strategic recommendations for the coach of the team. This system seems to have been a success — Case won more games the year they began to use Knuth’s system than they did the year before. IBM even recorded a short film about Knuth’s system called </span><i><span>The Electronic Coach</span></i><span>, which you can watch on Youtube </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhh8Ao4yweQ"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth was ahead of his time — modern NBA teams rely on detailed data analytics to better understand their players and the competition; in fact during the 2013-2014 season the NBA </span><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-07-nba-stats-llc-motion-tracking-sportvu.html"><span>installed SportVu motion tracking cameras</span></a><span> in every NBA stadium. These SportVu cameras monitor the movements of every player and the basketball at 25 frames per second, generating data about everything that happens in every basketball game. NBA teams, </span><a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/moreyball-the-houston-rockets-and-analytics/"><span>most famously the Houston Rockets</span></a><span>, have used these analytics to redefine how the game is played. While three point shots are the toughest shot to make, they have a higher expected value than a long two point shot (because the difference in shooting percentage between the two is marginal), increase the spacing between players (which makes it harder to play defense), and increases the likelihood of getting an offensive rebound (because missed three point shots tend to bounce further away from the basket). Realizing this, NBA teams consistently shoot more and more threes every season. In the 1979-1980 season, the first year the three point line was introduced to the NBA, the San Diego Clippers </span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980.html"><span>led the league</span></a><span> with 6.6 three point attempts (3PA) per game. Last year the Houston Rockets smashed that number, attempting the most threes in NBA history with </span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html"><span>45.4 attempts per game</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is all to say that Knuth was really onto something when he had the novel idea of using a computer to better understand a basketball game. You can learn more about the work of a NBA modern data scientist in this video from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLHMKTolVw"><span>Bloomberg</span></a><span> that profiles </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-seric-503b4731/"><span>Ivana Seric</span></a><span>, a senior researcher with the Philadelphia 76ers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Knuth’s application of math and computer science to other fields doesn’t stop there. Knuth is also an accomplished pipe organ player and a few years ago he composed, </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html"><i><span>Fantasia Apocalyptica</span></i></a><span>, a multimedia work for pipe organ. In </span><i><span>Apocalyptica </span></i><span>Knuth used a few mathematical and algorithmic methods to generate melodies. </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html"><span>On his webpage</span></a><span> Knuth says:</span></p>
<p><span>“At one point I thought I might have time to understand music theory well enough that I could try to teach that theory to a computer. But eventually I concluded that it would be better to create this piece almost entirely by hand, using my desktop machine only to help organize the work. Thus it’s definitely </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> “computer music”, although I do profess to be a computer scientist.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, I did apply some algorithms manually in a few places. For example, a haunting melody, taken from one of the earliest surviving instances of ancient Greek music, occurs ten times. I harmonized it differently each time, using the algorithm of David Kraehenbuehl that’s described in Chapter 22 of </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fg.html"><span>Selected Papers on Fun &amp; Games</span></a><span>. (See </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/randomness.ps.gz"><span>“Randomness in Music”</span></a><span>.)</span></p>
<p><span>Mathematical methods were also used to generate the changeringing patterns that appear briefly, as well as certain melodies used for the twelve tribes of Israel and for the twelve precious jewels below the “pearly gates” of the New Jerusalem. If those methods hadn’t been successful, I would have changed the results by hand. Fortunately, I didn’t have to do that; the algorithmic approach did give a pleasing result in those cases.”</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth’s diverse interests led Tarjan to ask a compelling question: “It’s been said that any field that has science in its name is not a science, so I might ask you is computer science a science, a branch of engineering, a branch of mathematics, an art — but let me ask it in a more personal way….do you see yourself as an artist, a scientist, a mathematician, an engineer, a philosopher, some combination?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knuth replied that he realized art stands not only for fine art but also for things that are artificial or made by human beings (as opposed to nature). He defined science as “what we understand well enough to explain to a computer” while “art is everything else.” He went on to say that as we learn more science about something our brains “keep a few jumps ahead, and that’s the art.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Knuth was asked if he had advice for students. Knuth’s response was to echo the </span><a href="https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/have-fun-life-and-career-advice-from-sir-c-antony-r-hoare-and-leslie-lamport/"><span>advice of Leslie Lamport</span></a><span> from earlier in HLF, which was to write often. However, Knuth cautioned to not be “too influenced by trendy stuff. Don’t write a paper because you have to write a paper or because you think you have to impress people about something that you aren’t personally really interested in…that’s the worst reason to write a paper.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tarjan added to this and said, “You have to figure out what your own path is and follow it. The best students I’ve had came in with or ended up with their own idea that they developed.” Clearly both men have had success finding and following their own path. </span><b>Watch the full conversation between Tarjan and Knuth on Youtube </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5g4Zl8ppQA"><b>here</b></a><b>. </b></p>

    <p>In my job as a scientific software developer, I tend to write a lot of code. And most people who haven’t been through a Computer Science degree tend to think that CS is “just” about slinging code at the screen and then running it. I have a good working relationship with many of my colleagues and co-workers with other backgrounds… Physics, Climate Science, Biology, etc. But when it comes to developing software, I get the distinct impression that people think, “Hey, how hard could this be?! We just write down a few instructions about what we want the computer to do, hit the execute button and the, ‘Blamo!’, we get our answer!”</p>

<p>The problem with that line of thinking is that it’s incredibly easy to write instructions that don’t mean what you think they mean. For example, your program could be completely uninterpretable by the computer. Furthermore, there is literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">no way to tell whether your program will ever actually terminate</a> without actually executing it. And there are many, many, <em>many</em>, ways to write a program which make it “slow” to execute. “Slow” being… like <em>really</em> slow. Like it would take your entire lifetime or more to actually execute it. This final problem is one that I see most often when reading software written by people without a CS education. And fixing that is my job.</p>

<p>The thing about CS that people don’t realize is that it teaches you about the theory of computation, computability (i.e. can we actually compute something? We often take for granted that we can!), algorithm complexity, and all of the knowledge, logic and analysis techniques and help you compose a program that will run in the minimum amount of time or using the minimum amount of space.</p>

<p>Allow me to show you an example of a huge optimization that I made to a simple script written by a colleague.</p>

<p>In climate science we do a lot of downscaling. We take temperature and precipitation readings from a coarse scale Global Climate Model grid and map them to a fine scale local grid. Let’s say the global grid is 50x25 and the local grid is 1000x500. For each grid cell in the local grid, we want to know to which grid cell in the global grid it corresponds.</p>

<p>A simple way to think about this is that we want to minimize the distance between L[n] and G[n]. So a simple way to do the search would be:</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:
  for each Global cell G[j]:
     compute distance between L[i] and G[j]
  find the minimum distance in the set L[i] * G
  return the index of the minimum
</code></pre>

<p>It seems simple enough. However, if you look closely, you’ll notice that you have to do a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Look at the algorithm in terms of the size of the input.</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:                        # Do this L times
  for each Global cell G[j]:                     # Do this L x G times
     compute distance (d) between L[i] and G[j]  # Do this L x G times
  find the minimum distance in the set d[i*j]    # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
  find the index whose cell matches the minimum  # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
</code></pre>

<p>The code for this looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>obs.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lon')
obs.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lat')
n.lon &lt;- length(obs.lon)
n.lat &lt;- length(obs.lat)

obs.lats &lt;- matrix(obs.lat, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat, byrow=TRUE)
obs.lons &lt;- matrix(obs.lon, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat)
obs.time &lt;- netcdf.calendar(nc.obs)

gcm.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lon')-360
gcm.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lat')
gcm.lats &lt;- matrix(gcm.lat, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon),
                   byrow=TRUE)
gcm.lons &lt;- matrix(gcm.lon, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon))
gcm.lons.lats &lt;- cbind(c(gcm.lons), c(gcm.lats))

# Figure out which GCM grid boxes are associated with each fine-scale grid point
# Confine search to 10 deg. x 10 deg. neighbourhood

dxy &lt;- 10
mdist &lt;- function(x, y)
    apply(abs(sweep(data.matrix(y), 2, data.matrix(x), '-')), 1, sum)
nn &lt;- list()
for (i in seq_along(obs.lons)) {
    if((i %% 500)==0) cat(i, '')
    gcm.lims &lt;- ((gcm.lons.lats[,1] &gt;= (obs.lons[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,1] &lt;= (obs.lons[i]+dxy))) &amp;
                ((gcm.lons.lats[,2] &gt;= (obs.lats[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,2] &lt;= (obs.lats[i]+dxy)))
    gcm.lims &lt;- which(gcm.lims)
    nn.min &lt;- which.min(mdist(c(obs.lons[i], obs.lats[i]),
                        gcm.lons.lats[gcm.lims,]))
    nn[[i]] &lt;- gcm.lims[nn.min]
}
nn &lt;- unlist(nn)
</code></pre>

<p>So, it seems like a simple algorithm. “Just” compute the distances and then find the minimum. But the way it was written, as the size of the number of local cells grows, our cost of computation grows by its product with the number of global grid cells. For Canadian ANUSPLIN data, there are 1068 x 510 cells (for a total of 544,680) and let’s say that our GCM has 50 x 25 cells (for a total of 1,250 cells). So the cost of the inner loop in “some computational unit” is:</p>



<p>where the  terms are constants that correspond to the cost of computing a distance between two points, finding the minimum point, and finding an array index. Really, we don’t care (much) about the constant terms, because they are not affected by the size of the input. So we can just clump them together and call the cost;</p>



<p>So for this set of input, our cost is </p>

<p>680 million.</p>

<p>That <em>seems</em> like a lot, but is it? Computers are fast, right? If we run the naive implementation that’s something like this:</p>

<p>it ends up taking 1668 seconds which is a little less than half an hour.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source('BCCA/naive.implementation.R')
500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ... 543000 543500 544000 544500 [1] "Elapsed Time"
    user   system  elapsed 
1668.868    8.926 1681.728 
</code></pre>

<p>But do we <em>need</em> for it to take 30 minutes? Here’s the thing. We’re comparing two grids together, both of which have tons of structure that we haven’t taken advantage of. For example the latitudes and longitudes in both the coarse and the fine grid are in sorted order. So if you want to search for a number, you don’t have to look at every single number. You can use a bisect algorithm where you look at the point in the middle and then decide which half of the array you want to search. Then searching the full space only costs you the log (base 2) of the search space.</p>

<p>The other major structure that we haven’t taken advantage of is the fact that the latitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension and the longitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension. So instead of doing an operation  times, we can do it  times. That’s a <em>huge</em> optimization.</p>

<p>What does that look like in pseudo-code?</p>

<pre><code>For each local[x]:
    bisect_search(local[x], Global[x])

For each local[y]:
    bisect_search(local[y], Global[y])

return a 2d grid of the search results for each dimension
</code></pre>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>## Perform a binary search on the *sorted* vector v
## Return the array index of the element closest to x
find.nearest &lt;- function(x, v) {
    if (length(v) == 1) {
        return(1)
    }
    if (length(v) == 2) {
        return(which.min(abs(v - x)))
    }
    mid &lt;- ceiling(length(v) / 2)
    if (x == v[mid]) {
        return(mid)
    } else if (x &lt; v[mid]) {
        return(find.nearest(x, v[1:mid]))
    }
    else {
        return((mid - 1) + find.nearest(x, v[mid:length(v)]))
    }
}

regrid.one.dim &lt;- function(coarse.points, fine.points) {
    return(sapply(fine.points, find.nearest, coarse.points))
}

## Take a fine scale (e.g. ANUSPLINE) grid of latitudes and longitudes
## and find the indicies that correspond to a coarse scale (e.g. a GCM) grid
## Since the search is essentially a minimizing distance in 2 dimensions
## We can actually search independently in each dimensions separately (which
## is a huge optimization, making the run time x + y instead of x * y) and
## then reconstruct the indices to create a full grid
regrid.coarse.to.fine &lt;- function(coarse.lats, coarse.lons, fine.lats, fine.lons) {
    xi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lon, obs.lon)
    yi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lat, obs.lat)
    ## Two dimensional grid of indices
    xi &lt;- matrix(xi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=F)
    yi &lt;- matrix(yi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=T)
    return(list(xi=xi, yi=yi))
}

</code></pre>

<p>The cost for every bisection search is the log of the input size. Our input size is divided into X and Y space this time, so we’ll use , and  for Global, Local, X and Y.</p>



<p>Plugging in our numbers this gives us a cost estimate of 553,076. 553 thousand sounds a lot better than 680 million. Do we see that in the run time?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ptm &lt;- proc.time(); rv &lt;- regrid.coarse.to.fine(gcm.lat, gcm.lon, obs.lat, obs.lon); print('Elapsed Time'); print(proc.time() - ptm)[1] "Elapsed Time"

<p>Soooooo… I know that I’m trained to do this kind of work and it’s my job to know how to do these types of things. But even <em>I’m</em> surprised and self-impressed at how significant that speedup is. That’s a <em>14 thousand times</em> speedup.</p>

<p>This script used to take so long that it had to save its output to disk and be manually checked by a scientist before proceeding. Now you can compute it in the blink of an eye. This is a computation that we have to do hundreds of times, and this saves us days to weeks of computation time. And it increases the ability to interact with the system, helping us to get more value out of our scientists’ time… they’re not sitting around waiting for a computation to finish. It just does it.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that these epic performance improvements come without buying any larger computer systems, no parallelization or increase in complexity… in fact the code for the faster algorithm is actually simpler and more reusable! It’s pretty much an all around win, just by reading the code and having …</p></div></div>

<p>This week we continue our four-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, II, III, IV) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week we prospected our iron ore and extracted it from the ground and did some initial mechanical processing (washing, sorting, crushing).  This week, we’re going to make our way from just rocks to an actual mass of <em>metal</em> rather than just some metal-bearing ore.  As we’ll see, we are going to do this by applying <em>heat</em> and (more importantly) <em><strong>chemistry</strong></em>:</p>

<p>The reader may be pardoned for having gotten to this point expecting to begin with exciting furnaces, bellowing roaring flames and melting all and sundry.  <strong>The thing is, all of that energy has to come from somewhere and that somewhere is, by and large, wood</strong>.  Now it is absolutely true that there are other common fuels which were probably frequently experimented with and sometimes used, but don’t seem to have been used widely.  Manure, used as cooking and heating fuel in many areas of the world where trees were scarce, doesn’t – to my understanding – reach sufficient temperatures for use in iron-working.  Peat seems to have similar problems, although my understanding is it can be reduced to charcoal like wood; I haven’t seen any clear evidence this was often done, although one assumes it must have been tried.</p>



<p>Instead, the fuel I gather most people <em>assume</em> was used (to the point that it is what many video-game crafting systems set for) was coal.  The problem with coal is that it has to go through a process of <em>coking</em> in order to create a pure mass of carbon (called ‘coke’) which is suitable for use.  Without that conversion, the coal itself both does not burn hot enough, but also is apt to contain lots of sulfur, which will ruin the metal being made with it, as the iron will absorb the sulfur and produce an inferior alloy (sulfur makes the metal brittle, causing it to break rather than bend, and makes it harder to weld too).  Indeed, the reason we <em>know</em> that the Romans in Britain experimented with using local coal this way is that analysis of iron produced at Wilderspool, Cheshire during the Roman period revealed the presence of sulfur in the metal which was likely from the coal on the site.</p>



<p>We have records of early experiments with methods of coking coal in Europe beginning in the late 1500s, but the first truly successful effort was that of Abraham Darby in 1709.  Prior to that, it seems that the use of coal in iron-production in Europe was minimal (though coal might be used as a fuel for other things like cooking and home heating).  In China, development was more rapid and there is evidence that iron-working was being done with coke as early as the eleventh century.  But apart from that, by and large the fuel to create all of the heat we’re going to need is going to come from <strong>trees</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>And, as we’ll see, really quite a lot of trees.  Indeed, a <em>staggering</em> number of trees, if iron production is to be done on a major scale</strong>.  The good news is we needn’t be <em>too </em>picky about what trees we use;  ancient writers go on at length about the very specific best woods for ships, spears, shields, or pikes (fir, cornel, poplar or willow, and ash respectively, for the curious), but are far less picky about fuel-woods.  Pinewood seems to have been a consistent preference, both Pliny (<em>NH</em> 33.30) and Theophrastus (<em>HP</em> 5.9.1-3) note it as the easiest to use and Buckwald (<em>op cit</em>.) notes its use in medieval Scandinavia as well.  But we are also told that chestnut and fir also work well, and we see a fair bit of birch in the archaeological record.  So we have our trees, more or less.</p>



<h2>Forests and Fellers</h2>



<p>The bad news is that while ancient sources are often <em>very</em> interested in trees (entire books about them, in fact), they are generally interested in trees used to make things like ships, buildings, furniture and weapons; essentially, elite products.  They are <em>not</em> interested in trees used as fuel.  Indeed, Latin marks this distinction, where wood for building was <em>materia</em> whereas wood for burning (but also, it seems, bulk wood being transported overseas) was <em>lignum</em>; our sources care greatly about the former and only minimally about the latter.  And so as soon as we get very far into the question of the harvesting and preparation of fuel woods, our evidence just about drops away entirely, save for a few poor mentions of this or that tree being good for charcoaling (a crucial process we’ll get to in a moment).</p>

<p>Consequently, our ability to see the fellows felling the forests (say <em>that</em> five times fast) is limited.  Medieval ‘foresters’ are often more visible, but much like we noted last time that when Georgius Agricola says ‘miner’ he means ‘mine owner,’ my understanding is that foresters in the Middle Ages were something closer to <em>administrators</em> of the forest (responsible for letting out contracts, catching poachers, etc.; essentially a sheriff but in the woods) rather than simple tree-fellers.</p>



<p>So who did the actual tree-cutting?  I must confess, I have found relatively little evidence for the social standing of ancient tree-fellers. <strong> In quite a lot of cases, they must not have been meaningfully distinct from the local peasantry or other sources of unskilled rural labor.</strong>  Clearly a lot of woodcutting was done by the rural population that bordered the forests to clear spaces for fields, gather fuel and firewood and so on, and consequently it seems like the basic skills of tree-felling may have been relatively common. The Latin word for a wood-cutter was a <em>lignator</em> (or sometimes a <em>caesor</em>, which meant ‘cutter’ but could mean of wood (<em>lignorum caesores</em>) or of stone), but that word most often appears in military contexts to mean soldiers tasked with cutting wood for fuel, not full-time lumberjacks.  Evidence for the medieval period is somewhat better and also generally suggests that the local peasantry was employed in the wood-cutting itself (for this, note J. Birrell, “Peasant Craftsmen in the Medieval Forest” <em>Agricultural History Review</em> 17.2 (1969): 91-107).  <strong>As we will see below, often wood cut for charcoaling was cut by the colliers themselves</strong>, who we will discuss below.  It seems hard to imagine that there wasn’t some division of labor in larger operations (like on Elba or at Populonia), but how that might have been structured is not clear from the limited evidence.</p>



<p>Not all timber works were so easily acquired, of course.  While ancient wood-cutters are hard to see in the evidence, ancient sawyers and carpenters are more visible; records from building programs in Athens and Delphi suggest that skilled sawyers (seemingly always assisted by at least one unskilled worker) were paid at least as well as citizen oarsmen in the Athenian navy and in some cases rather better.  The presence of English surnames like Carpenter, Cooper, Fletcher, Bowyer, Turner, Sawyer and Wheeler speak to the fact that these were specialized crafts in medieval England; the absence of wood-<em>cutting</em> surnames further suggests that the bulk labor of felling was mostly done by the local rural workforce.  <strong>Consequently, the social status of the average timber-cutter seems to have been about the same as that of a local peasant, serf or small-farmer, because by and large these seem to have been the same people</strong>; while the work done once the tree was down and barked might be done by specialists (but is far less important for trees that are going to be charcoaled).  There were also clearly specialist timber merchants, even in the ancient world, and the degree of their visibility, especially in timber-rich regions suggests that they could do quite well for themselves (although, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">like most merchants</a>, we effectively never see them penetrate into the ruling class), but again, these merchants were likely working with building timbers because, as we’ll see, charcoal wood doesn’t tend to travel very far.</p>

High quality building timbers or ship timbers do seem to have been valuable enough to be worth shipping long distances (Athens famously imported its ship-timber from Macedon), but fuel timbers tended to come from closer to hand.  But I <strong>had</strong> this picture and I wanted to use it.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The largest stock of forest-land was typically owned by the state, but private landholders owning their own forests also played a role, albeit generally a small one</strong>.  In Macedon, the king owned the forests and controlled the supply of lumber, granting or revoking the authority for communities within his territory to take advantage of woodland resources; the practice seems to have been the same, Meiggs (<em>op cit</em>.) notes, in the Near East.  In Roman Italy, a large amount of the forest-land was held by the state and contracted out for timber-cutting;<em> </em>Meiggs supposes that figures called <em>saltuarii</em> may have been responsible for making sure that …</p></div></div>

<p>I created several startups and one of them is profitable. My last one was a blockchain platform for the recruitment industry. We wanted to change recruitment and become a unicorn. It was a marketplace where we didn’t manage to acquire two types of target audiences – companies and job seekers. It was a very challenging time. However, I decided to move forward and focus only on the B2B market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a long time, I decided to create a new product for team management space and now everything will be different. First, it’s an open startup. Second, I will publish our journey and share all pitfalls and challenges we overcome. That’s why it’s time for Hardcore Year.</p>



<p>Our goal is <strong>$100k ARR in 1 year</strong>. 2020 is a really unusual year and as they said crisis is the best time for the new opportunities. Let’s check it out. </p>



<h2><strong>What’s Hardcore Year?</strong></h2>



<p>Kick ass challenge to get out of the comfort zone. Hardcore Year is the public and ambitious goal with sharing all key details during the journey. You will see the main problems we solve (or not) and of course data (probably, the most interesting for you :)). I am going to publish results at the end of each month.</p>



<p>I was inspired by great entrepreneurs who have already had their Hardcore Years. Here are the few of them:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Andrei Azimov (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/AndreyAzimov/status/1134472394091814912" target="_blank">Andrei Azimov</a> (Completed)&nbsp;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Reilly Chaze (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rchase.com/hardcore-year/" target="_blank">Reilly Chaze</a> (Completed)&nbsp;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Jon Yongfook (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1303861152603017223" target="_blank">Jon Yongfook</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/founders-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Alex Turnbull (opens in a new tab)">Alex Turnbull</a> from Groove (Completed)</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Why $100k ARR?</strong></h2>



<p>$100k ARR is a great milestone to validate an idea of the startup. It means ~8.3k MRR, which allows us to live and to develop the business. I want to build a profitable business that earns money without venture investments and has enough growth to make a successful company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a decent amount of interesting entrepreneurs who tell their story. Groove, Andrei Azimov, Reilly Chaze, and others. They have already had great results and some of them completed their Hardcore Year. This blog might be interested for you as I start from scratch now. I will share pitfalls, mistakes, and insights I get as a founder of the early-stage startup. I will show how we make a startup in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each month I publish an update with key metrics. I hope it will help others to start their journey and make something valuable for the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Focus?</strong></h2>



<p>My passion is simplifying complex things. We have a lot of different stuff every day. Different tools for work, challenges, goals, channels, news, and so on. That’s why I want to build a tool that helps companies to manage their team in a much better way than they have it now. To cut everything that is not important and focus on what really matters.</p>



<p>Focus is a team management software that helps to connect strategy with daily operations. It allows to get employees feedback and set the objectives. It’s not a usual project management tool. Because task managers don’t solve the real problem of management. They allow to do good task lists. However, many companies struggle with leadership and management. Employees don’t know how they affect the company’s goals. They even don’t know what are the main company’s goals in most cases. These issues and unskillful management directly impacts employees’ happiness and engagement. According the Gallup <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgenehuang/2019/04/26/most-employees-dont-hate-their-jobs/#59aa72ed573d">survey</a>, 66% of employees are disengaged in their job. I want to fix it and make it better by giving companies the best tool to manage their teams. </p>



<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>



<p>I will publish updates at the end of a month. Subscribe to the newsletter to get the latest news about our journey.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>We write so many functions in our programs that they become second nature before we know it. Like ants in a colony, they are numerous beyond imagination and they come together to form some surprisingly complex systems.</p><p>It begs the question: how do we write good functions? It can seem trivial: theyâ€™re just like ants after-all. But there is leverage in the answer: the right decisions multiply throughout your codebase and bubble up into great design.</p><p>I think there are about three key ideas you can employ to craft good functions. I wanted to share them with you.</p><p>Letâ€™s start with an example. We have an app, and we want to export some data in a JSON format. Hereâ€™s what a function for that could look like:</p><pre><code>function exportFile() { 
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = getData(); // [Data, Data, Data]
    const exportableData = toExportableData(data); // ExportableData
    const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(exportableData); // '{"data": {...
    const fileURL = saveFile("export.json", jsonStr); // https://foo.com/export.json
    setFileURL(fileURL);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}</code></pre><p>Seems straight forward: To export as JSON, we first get our data. Now, this data may have some sensitive info, so we clean that up and transform into something exportable; ExportableData. Once we have that, we get a string representation, save the file, and badabing, badaboom, weâ€™re done. </p><p>Okay, weâ€™ve got something working well.</p><p>But life moves on and our program needs to evolve. Instead of just exporting JSON, we need to do more: <strong>we also need to export a CSV file</strong>. </p><p>How do we do that?</p><p>The first thing we notice, is that exporting a CSV is very similar to exporting JSON. Can we abstract <code>exportFile</code>?</p><p>One thing we can do, is to introduce a new flag: something like <code>exportFile(/*isCSV=*/ true)</code> </p><pre><code>function exportFile(isCSV) { 
  ...
  let fileURL
  if (isCSV) { 
    const csvStr = toCSVStr(exportableData)
    fileURL = saveFile("export.csv", jsonStr);
  } else { 
    const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(exportableData);
    fileURL = saveFile("export.json", jsonStr);
  }
  ...</code></pre><p>By introducing this flag, we can conditionally produce a different <code>fileURL</code>: one for CSV and one for JSON. With that we see the first concept for abstraction: configuration. You pass some configuration, and you leave it to your function to figure what to do. </p><p>So, is it a good idea? </p><h2>The key <em>advantage</em> is that our logic is centralized.</h2><p>With configuration, the caller is limited in what they can do: they can only provide flags. All the true logic stays inside <code>exportFile</code>. This means that callers of the function canâ€™t go crazy and do something unsupported. And that could give us some peace of mind.</p><h2>The key <em>disadvantage</em> is thatâ€¦our logic is centralized.</h2><p>This will work, but letâ€™s think about it. First, notice that in order to understand <code>exportFile</code> now, we need to understand both the CSV and JSON case. Imagine if someone opens up <code>exportFile</code> to figure out what it does:  if they <em>only</em> cared about JSON, they now have to understand more logic than they needed. Anyone who changes the logic for CSV, may also end up breaking JSON. <code>**exportFile**</code> <strong>has become</strong> <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank"><strong>complected</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Notice also, that because the caller of this function can <em>only</em> provide flags, their hands are tied for use-cases that you didnâ€™t support. This was supposed to give you peace of mind, but it certainly can frustrate callers. imagine if they wanted to support XML, what could they do? Theyâ€™d have to edit <code>exportFile</code> to support this case. (God forbid they edit it to be something like <code>exportFile(isCSV, isXML)</code> â€” now you have invariant conditions on your hands). By being so specific, youâ€™ve chosen to make your function less abstract â€” this of course means that it is less powerful.  <code>**exportFile**</code> <strong>has become hard to extend</strong></p><h2>For better or worse, configuration gives the caller the least amount of power</h2><p>If you imagine a sort power spectrum, where the caller has the least power on the left, and most power on the right, configuration would be on the left. You control what the caller does so tightly that it gives your certainty, but makes your function more complex and less useful. </p><p>Say you wanted to address the problems, and move to the right of this spectrum, what could you do? </p><p>Well, if you look at what we wrote, we can notice that the only part that is <em>really</em> different, is the bit about taking <code>exportData</code>, and creating a <code>fileURL</code>. </p><pre><code>...
const exportableData = toExportableData(data); // ExportableData
... // *This can be different! Somehow we need to get a fileURL* 
setFileURL(fileURL);
...</code></pre><p>So one thing we can do is this: instead of providing a flag, we can provide a function: </p><pre><code>function exportFile(exportableDataToFileURL) { 
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = getData(); // [Data, Data, Data]
    const exportableData = toExportableData(data); // ExportableData
    const fileURL = exportableDataToFileURL(exportableData)
    setFileURL(fileURL);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}</code></pre><p>Now, for JSON, we can write </p><pre><code>exportFile((exportableData) =&gt; { 
  return saveFile("export.json", JSON.stringify(exportableData));
})</code></pre><p>and for CSV we can write: </p><pre><code>exportFile((exportableData) =&gt; { 
  return saveFile("export.csv", toCSVStr(exportableData));
})</code></pre><p>Oky doke, this is cool. </p><h2>The key <em>advantage</em> is that you give the caller more power</h2><p>With this we solve both of the problems we had with configuration. Now if someone looks under the hood at <code>exportFile</code>, they wonâ€™t see unrelated code about csv. If they wanted to extend to XML, they can simply provide a different function. Weâ€™ve given the caller much more power</p><h2>The key <em>disadvantage</em> is that it can be either too powerful or not powerful enough</h2><p>Weâ€™ve abstracted further, but there is a price there. The first is, that we <em>think</em> we know that what we <em>really</em> need to pass outwards is <code>exportableData</code>, and what we need to return is a <code>fileURL</code>. What if we were wrong? For example, some may need a slightly different data format â€” instead of <code>exportableData</code> they need <code>someOtherKindOfExportableData</code>. By the time we figured that out, itâ€™s possible that there are numerous new usages of <code>exportFile</code>, which weâ€™ll have to support as we evolve this function.</p><p>One way we could have prevented this, is to have stuck with configuration. This way, anyone who wanted to support something would have to funnel through this function, which would give us time to think about what the best abstraction was. </p><p>Another way, would have been if this function was abstracted even further, so callers could have easily supported <code>someOtherKindOfExportableData</code>.</p><h2>Inversion lies in the middle of the power spectrum</h2><p>Inversion is more powerful than configuration, but itâ€™s not the most powerful method. This can be a great choice, but you risk either being too powerful and exposing errors, or not being powerful enough and restricting callers. </p><p>We know the less powerful option: configuration. What would the most powerful one look like?</p><p>The next thing we may notice, is that our <code>exportFile</code> function is actually built up some building blocks that could be useful for a bunch of different things. For example, many functions may want a loading state, or just need to get <code>exportableData</code>, etc. We could create those building blocks:</p><pre><code>function exportJSONFile() { 
  withLoading(() =&gt; saveJSONFile(getExportableData()))
}


function exportCSVFile() { 
  withLoading(() =&gt; saveCSVFile(getExportableData()))
}</code></pre><h2>The key advantage is that the user gets the most power</h2><p>The building blocks that we just built, can be used in a myriad of ways. The user can support CSV, XML, can use <code>isLoading</code> with some other function, and choose to provide a different kind of <code>exportableData</code>.  Weâ€™ve provided a lot of power for the user.</p><h2>The key disadvantage is that you are the most vulnerable to mistakes</h2><p>The disadvantage though, like in the case of inversion, is that we open ourselves up to a lot of mistakes. What if <code>isLoading</code> was really meant for files, and other things should have been using a different flag? What if people start using <code>saveJSONFile</code>, and pass data that wasnâ€™t really an export? These are all cases that we have implicitly allowed with our abstractions. </p><p>Thereâ€™s a further problem: notice that with our first example of <code>exportFile</code>, you the code was more concrete: you could see what was actually happening. When code is more abstract, itâ€™s a bit harder to reason about what is <em>actually</em> happening. Now, it can be worth it for the power gains, but if you optimized prematurely, youâ€™re just paying this price for nothing. An example of this unnecessary price is <code>saveJSONFile</code> and <code>saveCSVFile</code> â€” if we had <a href="http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html" target="_blank">inlined</a> those, the overall composition would still be abstract but more understandable. These are the kind of things to watch out for as you abstract at this level.</p><h2>Composition is at the end of the spectrum</h2><p>And with that, we see that composition gives us the most power, but gives us the most opportunities to shoot ourselves in the foot. Boy can it be worth it though. </p><p>Itâ€™s funny to notice that with each option, the pro <em>is</em> the con. So how do we pick? I think one heuristic you can use is this: pick the most powerful option you can limited by your confidence. For example, if you have a light understanding of the problem, stay on the lower side of the abstraction spectrum. As you understand more (say, time to introduce XML) you can evolve to the powerful side of the spectrum. When youâ€™re <em>very</em> confident, and you can see good use-cases for your building blocks, lean to the most powerful side of the spectrum. </p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Julien Odent for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Machine Learning models are getting bigger and expensive to compute. Embedded devices have
restricted memory, computation power and battery. But we can optimize our model to run smoothly on
these devices. By reducing the size of the model we decrease the number of operations that need to
be done hence reducing the computation. Smaller models also trivially translate into less memory
usage. Smaller models are also more power-efficient. One must think that a reduced number of
computations is responsible for less power consumption, but on the contrary, the power draw from
memory access is about 1000x more costly than addition or multiplication. <!--more--> Now since
there are no free lunches i.e. everything comes at a cost, we lose some accuracy of our models here.
Bear in mind these speedups are not for training but inference only.</p>

<h2>Pruning</h2>
<!--proof-read-->
<p>Pruning is removing excess network connections that do not hugely contribute to the output. Ideas of
pruning networks are very old dating back to 1990s namely <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/250-optimal-brain-damage.pdf"><em>Optimal Brain Damage</em></a> and
<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/749-optimal-brain-surgeon-extensions-and-performance-comparisons.pdf"><em>Optimal Brain Surgeon</em></a>. These methods use Hessians to determine the importance of
connections, which also makes them impractical to use with deep networks. Pruning methods use an
iterative training technique i.e. <em>Train <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⇒</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Prune <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⇒</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Fine-tune</em>. Fine-tuning
after pruning restores the accuracy of the network lost after pruning. One method is to rank the
weights in the network using the L1/L2 norm and remove the last x% of them. Other types of methods
which also use ranking use the mean activation of neurons, the number of times a neuron's activation
is zero on a validation set and many other creative methods. This approach is pioneered by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626">Han
et.al.</a> in their 2015 paper.</p>

  </a>
    </span> <em>Fig 1. Pruning in neural networks from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626">Han et. al.</a></em></p>
<p>Even more recently in 2019, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle et.al.</a> paper titled <em>The Lottery Ticket
Hypothesis</em> the authors found out that within every deep neural network there exists a subset of it
which gives the same accuracy for an equal amount of training. These results hold for unstructured
pruning which prunes the whole network which gives us a sparse network. Sparse networks are
inefficient on GPUs since there is no structure to their computation. To remedy this, structured
pruning is done, which prunes a part of the network e.g. a layer or a channel. The Lottery Ticket
discussed earlier is found no to work here by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05270">Liu et.al.</a> They instead discovered that it was
better to retrain a network after pruning instead of fine-tuning. Aside from performance is there
any other use of sparse networks? Yes, sparse networks are more robust to noise input as shown in a
paper by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11257">Ahmed et.al.</a> Pruning is supported in both TF (<code>tensorflow_model_optimization</code>
package) and PyTorch (<code>torch.nn.utils.prune</code>).</p>
<p>To use pruning in PyTorch you can either select a technique class from <code>torch.nn.utils.prune</code> or
implement your subclass of <code>BasePruningMethod</code>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> torch<span>.</span>nn<span>.</span>utils <span>import</span> prune
tensor <span>=</span> torch<span>.</span>rand<span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span>
pruner <span>=</span> prune<span>.</span>L1Unstructured<span>(</span>amount<span>=</span><span>0.7</span><span>)</span>
pruned_tensor <span>=</span> pruner<span>.</span>prune<span>(</span>tensor<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To prune a module we can use pruning methods (basically wrappers on the classes discussed above)
given in <code>torch.nn.utils.prune</code> and specify which module you want to prune, or even which parameter
within that module.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>conv_1 <span>=</span> nn<span>.</span>Conv<span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
prune<span>.</span>ln_structured<span>(</span>module<span>=</span>conv_1<span>,</span> name<span>=</span><span>'weight'</span><span>,</span> amount<span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> n<span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> dim<span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This replaces the parameter <code>weight</code> with the pruned result and adds a parameter <code>weight_orig</code> that
stores the unpruned version of the input. The pruning mask is stored as <code>weight_mask</code> and saved as a
module buffer. These can be checked by the <code>module.named_parameters()</code> and <code>module.named_buffers()</code>.
To enable iterative pruning we can use just apply the pruning method for the next iteration and it
just works, due to <code>PruningContainer</code> as it handles computation of final mask taking into account
previous prunings using the <code>compute_mask</code> method.</p>
<h2>Quantization</h2>
<p>Quantization is to restrict the number of possible values a weight can take, this will reduce the
memory a weight can reduce and in turn reduce the model size. One way of doing this is changing the
bit-width of the floating-point number used for storing the weights. A number stored as a 32-bit
floating-point or FP32 to an FP16 or an 8-bit fixed-point number and more increasingly an 8-bit
integer. Bit width reductions have many advantages as below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving from 32-bit to 8-bit gives us a <em>4x</em> memory advantage straight away.</li>
<li>Lower bit width also means that we can squeeze me more numbers in registers/caches with leads to
less RAM access and in-turn less time and power consumption.</li>
<li>Integer computation is always faster than floating-point ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>This works because neural nets are pretty robust to small perturbations to their weights and we can
easily round off them without having much effect on the accuracy of the network. Moreover, weights
are not contained in very large ranges due to regularization techniques used in training, hence we
do not have to use large ranges, say ~ <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3.4</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mn>38</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-3.4\times10^{38}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3.4</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mn>38</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3.4\times10^{38}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for a 32-bit

is the value that maps to <code>0.0f</code>. This is also known as an <em>affine mapping</em>. Since <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is integer

A simple
method to achieve this is generating distributions of weights and activations and then taking their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"><em>KL divergences</em></a> with quantized distributions and use the one with min divergence from the
original. A more elegant way to do this is using <em>Fake Quantization</em> i.e. introduce quantization
aware layers into the network during training. This idea is proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877"><em>Jacob et. al.</em></a>.</p>

al.</em></a></p>
<p>While training the <em>Fake quantization</em> node calculates the ranges for the weights and activations
and store their moving average. After training, we quantize the network with this range to get
better performance.</p>
<p>More drastic bit-width also explored in papers on XOR nets by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279"><em>Rastegari et.al</em></a>, Ternary
nets by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830"><em>Courbariaux et. al.</em></a> and Binary nets by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01064"><em>Zhu et. al.</em></a> In PyTorch 1.3,
quantization support was introduced. Three new data types are introduced for quantization operations
<code>torch.quint8</code>, <code>torch.qint8</code> and <code>torch.qint32</code>. It also offers various qunatization techniques
included in <code>torch.quantization</code> package.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post Training Dynamic quantization</strong> : Replaces float weights with dynamic quantized versions
of them. Weight-only quantization by default is performed for layers with large weights size -
i.e. Linear and RNN variants.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>quantized_model <span>=</span> torch<span>.</span>quantization<span>.</span>quantize_dynamic<span>(</span>
    model<span>,</span> <span>{</span>nn<span>.</span>LSTM<span>,</span> nn<span>.</span>Linear<span>}</span><span>,</span> dtype<span>=</span>torch<span>.</span>qint8
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post Training Static quantization</strong> : Static quantization not only converts float weights to
int, but it also records the distribution of activations and they are used to determine the
scale of quantization at inference time. To support this calibration type quantization we add
<code>QuantStub</code> at the start of the model and <code>DeQuantStub</code> and the end of the model. It involves
steps mentioned below.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>myModel <span>=</span> load_model<span>(</span>saved_model_dir <span>+</span> float_model_file<span>)</span><span>.</span>to<span>(</span><span>'cpu'</span><span>)</span>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quantization Aware Training</strong> : Uses <em>fake quantization</em> modules to store scales while
training. For enabling QAT, we use the <code>qconfig</code> to be <code>get_default_qat_qconfig('fbgemm')</code> and
instead of <code>prepare</code> use <code>prepare_qat</code>. After this, we can train or fine-tune our model and at
the end of the training, get out the quantized model using <code>torch.quantization.convert</code> same as
above.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Post-training quantization in PyTorch currently only support operations on CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For detailed code examples visit the PyTorch documentation <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.html"><em>here</em></a>. On Tensorflow side
of things quantization can be done using TFLite's <code>tf.lite.TFLiteConverter</code> API by setting the
<code>optimizations</code> parameter to <code>tf.lite.Optimize.OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE</code>. Fake quantization is enabled by
<code>tf.contrib.quantize</code> package.</p>
<p>In the next part of <em>Making models smaller!</em> we will discuss Low-rank transforms, efficient
modelling techniques and knowledge distillation.</p>

September 25, 2020 | https://bhavaniravi.com/blog/how-to-be-productive | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bhavaniravi.com/blog/how-to-be-productive">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>We all want to be productive, efficient and put out our best work. People continuously ask me. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>how do you find time to do all these?
how do you keep yourself motivated?
how to be consistent?
how are you so productive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can go ahead and give you all my tips and tricks but before that, let's take a moment to understand what productivity is.</p>
<p>Productivity is not how long you can work on something, It is how much you can accomplish in a given time. </p>
<p>In a technology-filled life, scrolling twitter for 2 hours can feel productive because you learned so much. But we can't ignore that our attention span is getting closer to that of a goldfish shoving us away from essential tasks of our life like exercising or reading.  </p>
<p>To be more productive, we have to focus on two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Making more time</li>
<li>Using the available time efficiently</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I2TtWvg.png"></p>
</figure>
<p>Let's dissect these two in detail.</p>
<h2>Making More time</h2>
<p>Social media is a master of making us feel worthless. Quotes like "Everyone has 24 hours in a day." just rips off even the last bit of motivation have.</p>
<p>I have good news for you. No, not everybody has the same 24 hours in a day.
Some people have privilege and other people don't. While some have the privilege of outsourcing their work, others have 8-hour jobs, 3-hour travel, kids at home, cleaning, cooking, and whatnot, I get you. Some might call it an excuse. I don't think it is.</p>
<p>That said, we can't continue to live our life the same way forever. The idea of productivity can help you to add privilege to your life. Thereby you get more time to work on something that you love.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to make time in your super packed schedule?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>80-20 principle</h2>
<p>The 80/20 Principle or the Pareto principle says that 80% of our results depends on 20% of the things we do. The idea is to spend 80% of your energy on doing 20% of the important things.</p>
<p>Now, after reading this blog, you will get super pumped and add exercising, diet, reading, learning, writing, and everything you have been putting off into your list. But remember, habits take time to form. We need to focus on the item, which will have a maximum impact on your life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a list of all the task you want to do</li>
<li>Split the list into 2 based on 80% or 20% impact</li>
<li>Sort the two list again for 80% impact</li>
<li>Pick the top item from the 80% impact list</li>
</ol>
<h2>4 Quadrant technique</h2>
<p>The book Five habits of highly effective people call this technique a 4th generation time management technique. It is not practically possible to spend time on 20% of the things all the time. For eg., what happens when your boss asks you to finish an important task? </p>
<p>The four-quadrant technique gives you a closer look at your tasks at hand. It splits the functions into four parts.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2yXicKU.png"></p>
</figure>
<ol>
<li>Create a list of tasks</li>
<li>Classify them in the above four categories</li>
<li>Focus a complete the tasks in Important Quadrant</li>
<li>Defer from focusing on tasks at Interruption and Not important</li>
<li>whenever a task enters the crisis quadrant, finish them right there</li>
</ol>
<h2>GTD - Getting Things Done</h2>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2FpQqFr">GTD</a> is another framework to take things to completion. It is a 5-step process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a list of task</li>
<li>Block some time devoid of all distraction</li>
<li>Finish the task at hand</li>
</ol>
<h2>Being Aware of Time-stealers</h2>
<p>Social media is one of the biggest time stealers. I won't call it out for robbing our day; after all, that's the only socializing we have these days. The problem is these apps are addicting, and it is hard to break the cycle.</p>
<p>Here are some tips I follow to reduce my mobile usage</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a Digital time tracker</li>
<li>Set max time for each app</li>
<li>Go to your notifications setting, Don't think twice. Switch it all off, no but's or yet's</li>
<li>Blue ticks are nothing but obligations for you to reply as soon as you see the message. Switch it off. Reply to them when you have time at hand. Schedule them all to the end of the day works wonders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to detox from Digital medium</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the zen-mode app on your mobile to decouple from it for hours</li>
<li>Meditate and try to be with your thoughts</li>
<li>Leave your device at the other room</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use your time efficiently?</h2>
<p>Using time efficiently means being able to focus on the task at hand. It's called being in the state of <a href="https://amzn.to/35v4YhG">flow</a>. Have you ever captured all the motivation to start a task to find yourself lost on youtube finding the best playlist? Been there, done that.</p>
<p>As the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2DVa5w7">Deep work</a> quotes </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some techniques to make the most out of your time</p>
<h2>Creating a list</h2>
<p>Creating a list is by far the best thing to get on track, but there one problem. Lists are overwhelming.
Create a list and break them down into tiny tasks
Block a small-time chunk(10 minutes) and finish a task</p>
<h2>Pomodoro technique</h2>
<p>Pomodoro technique is like strength training for your brain. You focus on a task for N minutes and take a break for 10 minutes. Continue for 3-4 sets and take a long break of 20-30 minutes after that.
By continually doing the Pomodoro technique, you are training your brain to improve its focus window. Sooner you can increase the time to 30, 40, and 60 minutes.
I love Pomodoro for this reason, and the longest streak I had was 3 hours.</p>
<h2>Building Momentum</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most challenging thing for writers is to stare at a blank page</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all have starting trouble, but once we start doing one thing, there is a good chance we might do other things. The idea is to fuel the passion and keep the momentum up. </p>
<ol>
<li>Sandwich the task you hate along with the tasks you like. Set a timer for 5 mins and start doing it; you won't feel overwhelmed since it's low pressure.</li>
<li>Batch similar tasks together. Thereby you can remove the cognitive load involved in tasks switching</li>
</ol>
<h2>Mental &amp; Physical Health</h2>
<p>While you are putting these concepts into practice, remember your mental and physical health has a lot to do with productivity. Unlike machines, we can't add more core to improve our efficiency. We need stability and consistency.</p>
<p>Get a good sleeping routine. I can't even start to explain how fixing my sleep had made me 10x more productive and refreshed. Meditate, Meditate, Meditate, your mind can come up with new ideas or soak up new information only when it's clear. Incorporate some physical activity into your life.</p>
<p>Productivity in human beings, unlike machines, is to keep the energy and motivation up. To build momentum to start and finish the projects that we take up. There is no right or wrong way to try these methods. Try each of them, and develop a technique that suits you. Lastly, none of the frameworks will work if you are unwilling to put your part. </p></div></article></div>]]>

September 25, 2020 | https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">archive.org</a>

<small>2020-09-25</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-25T17:00:00Z -->
<p>
    So in my post <a href="https://underjord.io/is-this-evil.html">Is this evil?</a> I covered a way of tracking users with CSS. While
    thinking about those weird ways of using the web I also started thinking about pushing live data to clients
    without JS. Or at least maintaining a connection.
    So WebSockets requires JS. WebRTC requires JS. Even HLS (video streaming), which would otherwise
    be super cool, with captions for accessibility. But no. Or rather, maybe on Apple platforms. Eh. Not good enough.
</p>
<p>And then it hit me. From some old Nerves projects I'd seen, that there is a standard for just sending a stream of
    JPEG frames as a video. MJPEG. Did you know about MJPEG? Lots of people don't. It is used by lots of webcams and
    security cameras. Common option for Raspberry Pi hacks as well. MJPEG is super simple which is its big advantage.
</p>
<p>But video is what we expect. I was going for something else. So this could be used for a CI status light, showing
    any amount of visual status information. I use it for this:</p>
<p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>
<p>That's live. Or dead if my server falls over.</p>
<p>So how does MJPEG work. Well, you take an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and you shove an MJPEG URL into it. Done.</p>
<p>Okay, that's how you use it. Not how it works. I implemented it in Elixir, Elixir is quite good at keeping state and
    serving updates. Links are below. But basically the browser opens the connection, receives some headers and some
    chunks of data and then realizes it is dealing with MJPEG. It wil then just expect the chunks to keep coming.
    Indefinitely. Because this is live video. Frame by frame of JPEG.</p>
<p>The basic code for the MJPEG headers and chunking was lifted from a pi camera repo made by the Nerves team. It had a
    lot of Frank Hunleth and Connor Rigby in it so kudos to those guys as always. This is what I did with it: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg/blob/master/lib/mjpeg.ex">lawik/mjpeg</a></p>
<p>My server implementation is here and uses the above code: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg_example/blob/master/lib/mjpeg_example.ex">lawik/mjpeg_example</a></p>
<p>So I receive the connection and then that calls my MjpegExample GenServer to persist the connection and keep track of
    how to notify that connection about new data. It also triggers an update to notify everyone already connected.</p>
<p>This is not polished, it is hammered together and I'm curious to see if it falls over the next time I get a decent
    amount of traffic.</p>
<p>I really like this approach because it is a fun hack that simply happens to work across browsers and quite well at
    that. I like how it is just an img element and no frills. I added lazy loading because that works more nicely with
    things like Google Lighthouse scores and the loading experience (your browser doesn't spend a few seconds thinking
    about loading the image).</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is absolutely a poor choice to actually use aside from fun and hacky stuff. There is no good way of
    doing accessibility with it. You can update the pixels and that is it. Unless you can chunk-stream a txt-file in an
    iframe.
    Haven't tried that yet...</p>
<p>So, don't use it. But isn't it pretty neat?</p>
<p>Of course, much like the CSS tracking, this can be used for evilish things. You can absolutely keep track of how long
    someone keeps receiving your frames and use that for your analytics. I also find it neat that it lets me know
    concurrent users. I just log the number along with sending it out because I want to know at what number it breaks
    and out of curiosity but you can probably do some mildly untoward things with this. Oh.. Wait. You could serve
    rotating ads with this. You know what the last frame you sent was so if you get a click on it you can direct that
    particular user to the right thing. New title: Ad placement entirely without JS, ugh, no thanks. Moving on.</p>
<p>If you know how to make this more dirty, hacky and fun or even more useful or accessible feel free to get in touch at
    <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on
    Twitter where I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.</p><p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>

<p>When trying to get a position in a new company as a JavaScript developer, whether
it be Front-end, Back-end, or Mobile Apps, you will very likely need to
face a technical interview.</p>
<p>This interview will show to your potential future employer your level of skills
in programming with JavaScript, it may require you to do some whiteboard
examples or just a simple question and answer type of an interview.</p>
<p>Some people perform well, some don’t, because one of the factors is that you apply to
a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-does-junior-senior-expert-lead-experienced-professional-and-specialist-software-c36563e946e2/">position</a> that is appropriate to you. But in any case, preparation is the key.</p>
<p>By studying and simulating a test will enforce your knowledge and build up your
confidence, the more questions you go through, the more likely you will get one
of those questions.</p>
<p>I created a list of 50 questions that go from beginner to advanced level, try to
answer them first by yourself, and then check the answer. Try to respond to
as many of them as you can and take notes on those you don’t know or got wrong.</p>
<p>If you think I missed some important questions from the list let me know in the
comments.</p>

<p>Some of these are things I wish I knew at the beginning of my journey as a Software Developer so I could stress less.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>All tutorials are not created equal.</h2>
<p>Imagine yourself as a lab rat. </p>
<p>As you learn and experiment, pay attention to the kinds of tutorials that work for you. Many will not work. That’s fine. In fact, that’s exactly how experiments work until you find a solution.</p>
<p>But the moment you strike gold, stick to it, consume it voraciously and then find similar tutorials like that to continue rapid growth.</p>

<p>When I started, I used to bang my head against <em>Head First Java</em>, the book. But after studying for many hours, I just wasn’t getting anywhere. Yet, everyone online said it was the best programming book ever. But <em>TheNewBoston</em> youtube tutorials did it for me back then even though people don’t recommend him anymore.</p>
<p>I wish I could say this stopped after my 1st year. </p>
<p>Fast forward 2 years down the line when I started learning algorithms and <em>ALL</em> the blog tutorials I followed just didn’t make sense until I watched Youtube videos on Hungarian folk dance teaching algorithms.</p>
<p>And it just clicked. </p>
<p>Since then, my approach to learning has been to <strong>learn the same thing from multiple places</strong> until I find the instructor and style that works for me.</p>
<h2>If you’re not practicing with a project, nothing goes into long term memory</h2>
<p>You’ll forget a lot of things.</p>
<p>Deeply understanding this will change how you learn. </p>
<p>I can’t count the number of times I took <em>Introduction to Python Programming</em> on Udacity, Coursera, etc and still forgot everything.</p>
<p>It’s so annoying. </p>
<p>But I’ve since learned that you’ll forget anything you learn in isolated exercises because they are stored in short term memory. Neuroscience research shows that this is just how the brain works. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to forget, test your knowledge using spaced repetitions. To do this, build projects. </p>
<p>I’ll give you a concrete example: <em>len(myList)</em> will give you the length of a list in Python. You’ll learn this in Udacity’s intro course. </p>
<p>Come back a month later and you might not remember if it’s <em>len, length( ) or myList.size( )</em>. </p>
<p>But with spaced repetition through a project, the outcome is different. For example, you work on a 2-month long Django app for new coders where you need to count multiple times the number of users, the number of exercises done, the number of chats, etc. Imagine doing this throughout the span of the project, for two months. it’s hard to forget what len( ) does.</p>
<p>This is a trivial example, but hopefully you get the idea. </p>
<p>New learners can start with simple, isolated examples. </p>
<p>But <strong>if you’re not practicing within the scope of a project that makes you use and reuse what you’ve learned, nothing is going into your long term memory</strong>; it’s all short-term. And you’ll forget.</p>
<h2>Work within fear; not against it.</h2>
<p>I’ll admit: this one is easier said than done. </p>
<p>But you have to master this if you want to last long.</p>
<p>There’s this temptation to fix your fear first before you continue to learn. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>In fact, you’ll spend a lot of time trying to make your fear disappear that it’ll only double your anxiety. You have to find a way – your way – to acknowledge that you’re afraid, and frankly will continue to be afraid for a long time, then work within that realization. No need to fight it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this fear disappears as you become more proficient. </p>
<p>Other times, it vanishes for a while and comes back when you get into a new environment, work with smart software developers, or move to a completely new stack.</p>
<p>It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>This <em>IS</em> the life.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a sinusoidal wave – endlessly going up and down. Don’t take it too seriously or you’ll lose yourself.</p>
<h2>Consistency &gt; hard work.</h2>
<p>Consistency is king. </p>
<p>When you start learning,  you lay down neural pathways that make it easier to retrieve information. According to Neuroscience research, these pathways only get strong through frequency of use, not just intensity.</p>
<p>This means 30 minutes a day, for 5 days a week is way better than 2.5 hours one day, only once a week. </p>
<p>Same hours; Different impact.</p>
<p>Don’t just work hard, apply wisdom here.</p>
<h2>Talent = hidden practice.</h2>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss progress as talent.</p>
<p>My first programming class was in C++ and my classmates refused to believe I had never coded before because I was just-so-talented. </p>
<p>But what they also refused to accept was that right after class, I would spend five hours typing <em>cout &lt;&lt; “this is my first program”</em>, realize it didn’t run because I forgot a semicolon; retype it and realize it didn’t print out my statement on a new line because I didn’t add endl.</p>
<p> This deliberate practice built perceived talent.</p>
<p><strong>Talent is sexier than hustle</strong> so no one wants to hear that you worked hard and got here. Just tell me you were born this way - it’s more believable.</p>
<p>But becoming a proficient developer is like playing an instrument. </p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Talent vs. Hustle - The majority of us mostly hustle our way through it.</em></p>
<p>Only a tiny few are born talented. </p>
<p>The majority can only get as good as the amount of practice they put in. And you can immediately tell a student hasn’t been practicing the moment they sit at the keyboard.</p>
<h2>You’ll meet a**holes!</h2>
<p>Every field has its dose of horrible people. </p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure what it is about software dev that attracts a**holes in droves. Maybe because coding gives the feeling of having a super-power or a rare skill. If you’re a newbie, you’ll meet those who’ve been coding for years and think no one else should come in.</p>
<p>A windows developer only? You’ll meet linux fanatics that think you’re mediocre. </p>
<p>If you’re a woman, you’ll immediately be dismissed because of your gender. I know this from personal stories from colleagues over the years.</p>
<p>If you’re a minority, you’ll meet people who think you should only fetch coffee; not code. </p>
<p>If you’re coming from another field (particularly not STEM), you’ll meet people who automatically make themselves gatekeepers of the programming community. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We don’t want social scientists here; we’re purists!”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re online. </p>
<p>At work. </p>
<p>And sadly sometimes in your family. </p>
<p>It’s not <em>if</em> you’ll meet them, it’s <em>when</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to move on.</strong></p>
<p>Things are getting better but there’s still a lot to do to educate people. </p>
<p>But don’t let this deter you. Build your resilience so you don’t quit after you meet these people. </p>
<p>And when you get to the top don’t be an a**hole!</p>
<h2>Master 1 thing.</h2>
<p>New developers tend to jump around learning a lot of things. </p>
<p>Okay, it’s not just new devs; it’s also experienced folks. </p>
<p>You learned React for one week.</p>
<p>Then JavaScript for two weeks.</p>
<p>Laravel for three. </p>
<p><strong>Stop.</strong></p>
<p>You need to wake up and realize that the harsh truth is that you’re simply extending the time it’ll take you to truly learn anything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If one is a master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.”</em> - Vincent Van Gogh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pick one thing. </p>
<p>Stick with it for a few months – ideally 6 to 12 months before you move to something else. </p>
<p>This has two benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll go deep enough and hit critical mass that moves you towards mastery.</li>
<li>After you master one domain, you can transfer knowledge to another. Learn Flask and you can easily walk into Django. Learn React deeply, and you can quickly identify the pros and cons of Laravel within a few days. </li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t mean learn HTML alone for six months then only CSS for 1 year; rather, it means don’t mix up learning Django, with Express, then React, some Gaming Development, and iOS. </p>
<p>You might get a lot done in a short time.</p>
<p>But you’ll master nothing!</p>
<h2>Software development is an ever evolving field.</h2>
<p>It’s exciting.
It’s frustrating.
It’s intimidating.</p>
<p>But if I had to, I’d do it all over again.</p>
<h2>Thanks for reading.</h2>
<p>If you enjoyed this and you’re on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeTechPsych/status/1306588995313438722?s=20">like and retweet this</a> to help spread the word. I know it sounds trivial but it actually really helps.</p>
<p>I’m trying out a new initiative to help new coders and junior devs feel less overwhelmed, manage imposter syndrome and learn smarter. </p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not sure what this looks like yet. But I’m putting together some resources and write-ups based on what people need the most help with. </p>
<p><strong>If you’re interested, <a href="https://ctt.ac/I1f33">let me know on Twitter</a>. If you prefer sending a direct message, <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeTechPsych">my DM is open.</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Heads Up</em> - I love research so I tend to back my advice and approach with concepts from Behavioral Psychology and Neuroscience.</p></div></div>]]>

September 25, 2020 | https://philipkiely.com/essays/gumroad_hom.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://philipkiely.com/essays/gumroad_hom.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><code>| First Posted <b>24 September 2020</b> | Last Edited <b>24 September 2020</b> | Philip Kiely |</code></p><div>
  <p>On Friday, September 4th, 2020, I logged into my job as a software engineer, flattened some bugs, received a strong first-sixty-days performance review, and ended the workday at a reasonable hour, gently entering a long labor-day weekend. Four days later, I resigned from what was my first <span>SWE</span> job out of college after just twelve enjoyable weeks to take a quarter-time role in marketing making even more money. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<h3>Daniel&nbsp;Vassallo</h3>
<p>Our story begins in Seattle in early 2019. A man named Daniel Vassallo <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/">quit a job making $500K a year at <span>AWS</span></a> to work for himself as an independent creator. Originally from Malta, Daniel moved to America during his eight year tenure with Amazon. After leaving <span>AWS</span>, Daniel published an ebook and video course on Gumroad, and by September 2020 had grossed over $200K in&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>I first encountered Daniel’s work when I was looking for interview subjects for <a href="https://philipkiely.com/wfsd">Writing for Software Developers</a>. Many of the people who I was interviewing had been writing about software for a decade or more, so I wanted to find someone who was relatively new to writing online but had quickly found massive success. Daniel fit the bill perfectly. On January 21, 2020, I introduced myself with <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1303480184130228224">this cold email</a>, which quickly led to an&nbsp;interview.</p>
<p>I kept in touch periodically and Daniel gave me a huge signal boost on launch day. In the following months, we built on each others’ posts on Twitter and exchanged a couple of messages, he read my book, I watched his Twitter course. When he did something clever, I copied it, and it usually worked. Stage left is&nbsp;set.</p>
<h3>Sahil&nbsp;Lavingia</h3>
<p>On stage right, Sahil Lavingia is running <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>. After <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">some ups and downs</a>, the company is operating profitably and growing smoothly. When massive portions of the global economy suddenly moved online due to <span>COVID</span>, Gumroad’s growth spiked. In April 2020, I sent Sahil a cold <span>DM</span> requesting an interview, not for the book, but for a feature-style profile I was writing for my creative nonfiction class in my final semester at Grinnell College. I intended to shop the piece around to various business-focused publications after the workshop. After exchanging several emails with Sahil and writing the piece, I knew it would never be published, not out of lacking merit, but out of conflict of interest: I would be using Gumroad to sell Writing for Software Developers. Every other platform was out of the running once I knew Sahil’s&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>This essay is long enough without a complete retelling of the launch of Writing for Software Developers, although that is one of my favorite things to retell. Highlights: $15,000 first day, $20,000 first week as a brand new Gumroad user. <a href="https://twitter.com/gumroad/status/1260964938018742272">Here’s the tweet</a>. I was on Gumroad’s radar for a minute, but this industry moves&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>I started writing micro-targeted clickbait a couple of weeks later to maintain my relevance. I say “micro-targeted” because the only click I was trying to bait was Gumroad’s click of the retweet button. My <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1266746268891611137">most successful such tweet</a> got over 169,000 views. <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1287418074220711937">Most tweets that were picked up</a> did about a tenth of that. Still, it was enough to keep me on Gumroad’s&nbsp;radar.</p>
<p>Gumroad was also on my radar. In late July, I saw a post from Sahil saying that they were looking to hire some engineers. I looked over the job description, but I didn’t seriously consider applying. I was not experienced with the technologies in their stack and I don’t like doing engineering on an hourly basis. Also, I was quite content with my existing <span>SWE</span> job. I give the post a pass, although a line from the last paragraph, “<em>Head of Marketing</em> - take over all marketing/growth/content/support from Sahil, build <span>&amp;</span> launch a great multi-year growth strategy,” did stick in my head for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>In August, Justin from Gumroad reached out to me to see if I was interested in being featured in a creator spotlight. I was thrilled! Daniel Vassallo was the series’ first subject; I had figured it would take quite a while until I had a high enough profile to warrant a spotlight. Justin wrote <a href="https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/creator-spotlight-philip-kiely-s-success-on-gumroad">a great article</a> and Sahil reviewed and approved it personally, so I knew for certain that he knew my full&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>It took about a thousand words, but I’m fairly sure that you now have the context to understand that my “cold” email was closer in temperature to an off-brand cooler during overtime than a crisp drink from the&nbsp;commercials.</p>
<h3>Philip&nbsp;Kiely</h3>
<p>On September 1st, 2020, I was lying in bed when I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1300853597337341952">this tweet</a> from Daniel. Quarter time? Ten thousand dollars a month? Work at Gumroad where your job is to help more people make more money on the internet? All that for one email and one phone call? Daniel got a sweet deal and I wanted exactly the same thing. I have been known to send a successful cold email. I sat up, typed out <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1303482038046126080">this email to Sahil</a>, and had a hard time falling asleep that&nbsp;night.</p>
<p><img alt="My Email to Sahil" src="https://philipkiely.com/assets/img/gumroad_hom_email.jpg"></p>
<p>The next morning, Sahil responded “haha, great email. I’d love to&nbsp;chat.”</p>
<p>We set a time for the next Monday. I asked if there was anything in particular he’d like me to prepare for the interview, or if I should bring a surprise. “A surprise works!” he&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>There was only one problem: I had absolutely no idea what to make. After talking it over with a few friends, I came up with a structure for my application&nbsp;packet.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;surprise:</p>
<ol>
<li>A job&nbsp;description</li>
<li>Plans for growth, content, and&nbsp;support</li>
<li>A plan for an upcoming&nbsp;launch</li>
<li>A reflection on the application&nbsp;process</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the course of the next few nights and that long weekend, I put together the application packet, about six thousand words in all. I kept in touch with Sahil throughout the process, asking various questions to get the context I needed to create meaningful plans. If I had not spent the past six months idly studying Gumroad as a business, I would not have been able to complete so much work so quickly. Exactly 24 hours before I was to talk to Sahil, I sent him the surprise as a series of&nbsp;PDFs.</p>
<p>During those five days, I spent a great deal of emotional energy chasing my shadow. Sahil was <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1301936779440738304">talking publicly</a> about hiring Daniel, and he also kept mentioning doing the same for the role I applied for. In his email newsletter, he wrote “even more amazing folks applying for other positions at the company, including a quarter-time Head of Marketing.” I saw the massive spread of Daniel’s own tweet and I concluded that some clearly superior candidate had applied for the same role and basically already had the job. I imagined someone with an <span>MBA</span>, years of experience, and ten times my Gumroad revenues sending exactly the email I had sent. I figured my application was a long shot but I was far enough in that I might as well go through with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>On Labor day, September 7th, 2020, I got a call from Sahil in the afternoon. We spoke about a variety of topics for over an hour. Forty minutes in, he asked me what I was looking for in terms of salary. It turns out I was the only candidate for the job. The person he had been writing about in the past week was me. I had been chasing my shadow, but it had motivated me to do my best work on my application because I thought I was competing against someone with a lot more experience for the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>Sending the application packet well before the interview was essential because we had a shared basis of ideas to discuss rather than me presenting the ideas for the first time and receiving his reactions. This helped out discussion be substantive and solutions-oriented. Rather than an interview, it was the first day of working together, which was a much more effective framework for getting things&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>One bit of negotiation during the phone call that I am proud of is that I requested my start date be backdated to September first, the day I had sent the email, earning me a full month of pay for September instead of prorating. Sahil agreed on the basis of the work I had already done throughout the week to prepare the application packet. This is essentially the same as negotiating a signing bonus, but applies outside of the “salaried employee” context. I don’t recommend this tactic for traditional positions, negotiating a signing bonus is far more straightforward in most&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>By the end of the day Monday, I had a written informal offer from Sahil, but we were unable to do the paperwork because it was a federal holiday, so Gumroad’s legal and financial advisory was out of office. Tuesday morning, I informed the <span>CTO</span> and my manager at my then-current job that I had accepted a new role. They were disappointed but very supportive. “Two weeks notice” is a professional courtesy, not a requirement, in at-will employment situations. My previous employer and I split the difference based on the scope of work that I had committed to doing. I ended up sticking around for five business days to wrap up my various projects so as to not leave my team hanging. I worked at Gumroad in the evenings as I got onboarded with the&nbsp;company.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday I finalized the contract with Gumroad. I was impressed that Gumroad’s <span>CFO</span> was able to get me set up with a signed independent contractor agreement (with no restrictive clauses whatsoever), tax paperwork, and direct deposit, all in a single day. That evening, Sahil announced my hiring on Twitter, which in my book is better proof than a&nbsp;contract.</p>
<p>It took one week from first contact to signed contract for me to become the Head of Marketing at Gumroad, but that week was only possible because of the months leading up to it. I’m working far more than quarter time at the moment, but that was agreed upon ahead of time; quarter time is the goal that I’m working towards by improving at the job and implementing processes. I’m sure I’ll get there eventually, but for now I’m having too much fun to slow&nbsp;down.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>ButcherBox, a meat subscription and delivery service, recently moved the tech stack for <a href="https://www.butcherbox.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their e-commerce site</a> from a PHP monolith to <a href="https://jamstack.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jamstack</a> to improve performance and agility while lowering costs. In this post, we will break down <a href="https://youtu.be/pGjEz9bVoos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ButcherBox's journey to Jamstack</a>, as told by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffgnatek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Gnatek</a>, their head of engineering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you run a subscription-based e-commerce business and want to reduce technical debt while decreasing page load time and development time, their story will give you the direction you need for a successful migration. But first, for those who don't know: Jamstack stands for JavaScript, API, and Markup stack.</p>
<p>Jamstack is a web development approach focused on using client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. This approach separates different concerns in different areas, allowing for faster development, easier maintenance, and reduced cost and complexity in comparison to monolithic PHP code.</p>

<h2 id="monolithic-code">Starting with a Monolith</h2>
<p>In 2015, ButcherBox started on Kickstarter and quickly brought their website to life with <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>. Non-technical people found it easy to work with, PHP and jQuery developers were easy to hire, and there were no expensive DevOps involved. All it took to publish a page was to press "Publish" in WordPress and specific behavior was added through plugins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the complexity of ButcherBox grew, their performance dropped. Working with Wordpress's PHP means having frontend and backend code in single files. Although this is a standard, it becomes problematic as the number of developers on a team grows.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, backend code is involved in the business logic and security of the system while frontend code is involved in presenting the information in a beautiful and intuitive way. Having both of them in a single file is okay for small teams, but not for when there are designated developers working explicitly on one of the two. Managing conflicts in the file edits on itself can double development time and time spent on related tasks.</p>
<p>Gnatek says that their bottleneck was their platform. Whenever they wanted to introduce some new features they needed to work on it for a long time in advance, which limited their ability to follow trends and implement new ideas on the fly.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the complexity of their website resulted in having page load times around 4 seconds, sometimes even as high as 7 seconds. This is a huge issue for an e-commerce website as <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/blog/ecommerce-site-speed" rel="noopener">page load time has a great impact on conversion rates</a>. Realizing this, they decided to change how they developed and managed their website.</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-the-code">Decoupling the Code</h2>
<p>ButcherBox started separating their building blocks and concerns into different areas. The goal was to swap the engine out mid-flight—to change the system incrementally, moving it from the old, slow one to the new, faster one.</p>
<p>This method, known as the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Strangler Fig Pattern</a>, uses a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reverse proxy</a> such as <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nginx</a> to determine where each user's request should be handled. If the request accesses something that has been migrated to the new codebase it will be forwarded to that; otherwise the old website would be presented. ButcherBox started by routing the one-time purchase pages of their shop to a new website without affecting the old one.</p>
<p>The new website was created by separating frontend and backend code bases, using <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/blog/rest-apis">APIs</a> to communicate between the two. This strategy on its own created a faster-perceived page load time. It also improved security since they no longer needed to expose a PHP server. They relied on <a href="https://auth0.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Auth0</a> to handle their authentication and authorization process and used <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netlify</a> to build and serve their website over the internet.</p>
<h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>
<p>Frontend development was done using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GatsbyJS</a>. This framework is based on <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">React</a> and allows for the reuse of components which reduces development time.</p>
<p>Gatsby, and React in general, is based on the idea of components that work independently of each other. As an example, your <em>recent article column</em> doesn't need to be aware of your footer, so by separating their code we allow for reusable components and faster development time. Besides, Gatsby relies on server-side rendering which improves page load time at the cost of static build time on the server every time the website is updated.</p>
<h3 id="backend">Backend</h3>
<p>After separating the frontend and backend, ButcherBox started separating backend components. They started by dividing the code into two parts: the core business logic and the ephemeral contents such as product catalog, inventory, merchandising, and promotional ads. All of these separations of previously entangled parts allowed for higher test coverage and reduced the risk that a single update to the website would crash everything. It also allowed for a more agile development.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-the-admin">Replacing the Admin</h2>
<p>To replace the WordPress admin they used <a href="https://nova.laravel.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Laravel's Nova</a>, a highly customizable admin panel written in PHP. Nova helped the non-technical members of the team work with the system without having to deal with direct database interfaces. To add food recipes—content that supports the selling of their meat products—the team moved to <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> which provides a full-featured editor that automatically triggers a build on Netlify whenever there is new content to be served.</p>
<p>This proved to be problematic at first: having many different components and server side rendering together means that any small change requires a full rebuild of the website, taking as much as 20 minutes sometimes. To work around this issue, the team started creating different instances of frontend and backend, each working independently. This meant that adding a new food recipe wouldn't trigger a build for the Shop page.</p>
<p>To speed things up, they shared components among the instances wherever possible. For example, to reuse Gatsby's logic on the frontend, they used <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/">Gatsby Themes</a>, a collection of reusable, shareable functionality to be used among different Gatsby instances.</p>
<p>This journey took their website from a slow monolith in PHP with increasing complexity and development costs to a fast, easily <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/blog/scalable-commerce" rel="noopener">scalable e-commerce site</a>. The team reported that their website was about <strong>600% faster</strong> on average (going from 4000ms to under 600ms), and that the development team was able to launch a new part of the website within days.</p>

<h2 id="is-jamstack-right-for-you-">Is Jamstack Right for You?</h2>
<p>Jamstack is a great method for web development, but like all other methodologies, it is not for everyone. There are certain things to consider before choosing to work with Jamstack.</p>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
<p>First, consider the data you're presenting on it. Does it need to be dynamic, relying on different users? A typical example of this would be social media sites that show you your friends' activities. Having dynamic data is not necessarily bad, but it requires having a set of APIs to provide them. That said, I wouldn't recommend using Jamstack if more than a third of your data needs to be dynamic.</p>
<p>Second, consider how fast the updates to your website should go live. Can the changes wait a few minutes to propagate? This would be okay for a blog post or a food recipe, but not so much for stock count and pricing. Again, if your data falls into this category, you can deliver it to the client through an API. But that would be too much trouble if all or most of your data requires real-time updates.</p>
<p>Finally, do you already have an API or different sources of content? The data presented on your website will usually be propagated from different sources such as Contentful, a database, and an API. If you already have different sources of data, that's a plus. Otherwise, you have to create them as you go along. This is exactly what ButcherBox did.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Switching to Jamstack provides better security, better performance, reduced complexity in code, and low-friction hosting. The only apparent downside is the cost of migrating to such a system.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Jamstack relies on many third-party services, which is great for reducing costs and complexity of your codebase, but any downtime on those services could potentially affect you.</p>
<p>With all that said, are you ready to switch your monolithic e-commerce site to Jamstack? If so, <a href="http://fabric.inc/" rel="noopener">Fabric</a> can help simplify the process.</p>

  </p>
  <p>I show how to implement event listeners and dependency injection using Rust's type system to avoid common errors in stringly-typed versions of these extensible architectures.</p>
  <p><em>All code in this note is available <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/types-over-strings">on Github</a>.</em></p>

<p>Types are a useful tool to make sure software libraries work together. I expect an int, you give me a string, compiler raises an error. In my experience, types, interfaces and encapsulation work best when using black-box APIs: hash maps, regexes, HTTP requests. The programmer controls the top-level program, i.e. the types that orchestrate the individual pieces.</p>

<p>However, the Type Life tends to become harder when dealing with frameworks, or any kind of <em>extensible architecture</em> where the programmer is plugging components into a bigger system they don’t control. For example, consider the venerable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener"><code>EventTarget.addEventListener</code></a> from JavaScript:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>click</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>clientX</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>clientY</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an extensible architecture in the sense that you don’t control the DOM API, nor can you control what events are registered to DOM nodes. That changes all the time. You can only hook in to events the browser provides.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this function with two related questions: what is the type of <code>addEventListener</code>? And what kinds of errors can we make using this function?</p>

<p>The most basic type for <code>addEventListener(event, listener)</code> is that <code>event</code> is a string, and <code>listener</code> is a function. A function from what to what? The input is an “event”, whatever that means, and there is no output. Indeed, when <code>addEventListener</code> gets ported into a statically typed language like <a href="https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-webapi-incubator/blob/ffa8b27ffacbe9c2a97b9ee1509d83918a5ea01a/src/Webapi/Webapi__Dom/Webapi__Dom__EventTarget.re#L4">ReasonML</a>, the type definition looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>external</span> <span>addEventListener</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>Dom</span><span>.</span><span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s two ways we can mess this up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Typo the event name</strong>: as with all stringly-typed programming, we can write the event name incorrectly, like <code>"clack"</code> instead of <code>"click"</code>. This error gets caught at runtime, usually when we register the handler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use the event object incorrectly:</strong> while all events implement the base <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event"><code>Event</code> interface</a>, each individual event has different fields. For example, “click” is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent"><code>MouseEvent</code></a> so it contains fields <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code>. But what if I tried to access <code>clientX</code> on a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a>? That error gets caught at runtime, when we execute the offending code path in the handler.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this note, I’ll show how you can avoid errors like these by designing type-safe extensible systems. We’ll look at two examples: event handling and dependency injection. The code will use Rust, but the lessons apply to any functional language.</p>

<h2 id="type-safe-event-listeners">Type-safe event listeners</h2>

<p>The basic idea in making type-safe extensible architectures is to replace strings with types. Any time you use a string as an identifier (e.g. for an event, or a software component), use a type instead. Why?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Types are better identifiers than strings. If you typo a type, the type checker can catch your mistake.</li>
  <li>Types can be associated with additional information. The string <code>"click"</code> means nothing to the type checker. But the type <code>ClickEvent</code> tells the typechecker about what fields the event has, and how event listeners should handle the event.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of using a type-safe event API in Rust.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>OnClick</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>mouse_x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
  <span>mouse_y</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>dispatcher</span> <span>=</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>dispatcher</span><span>.add_event_listener</span><span>(|</span><span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>OnClick</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.mouse_x</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>);</span>
  <span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.mouse_y</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>dispatcher</span><span>.trigger</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>OnClick</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>mouse_x</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span>
  <span>mouse_y</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the snippet above, the event type is inferred from the type parameter <code>OnClick</code> of the closure, rather than using a string argument. This solves both of our errors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we wrote <code>&amp;OnClack</code>, the type checker will say <code>OnClack not found</code>.</li>
  <li>If we wrote <code>event.keyboard_input</code> instead of <code>event.mouse_x</code>, the typechecker will say <code>no field keyboard_input on type OnClick</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stupendous! But how does it work? Here’s the basic structure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Events must not contain pointers to things, for simplicity</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>Event</span><span>:</span> <span>'static</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>// An event listener is a function from an event to nil</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>EventListener</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>:</span> <span>Event</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>FnMut</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>'static</span><span>;</span>

<span>// An event dispatcher holds all the event listeners</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* .. */</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Registers a function `f` to listen for an event `E`</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>add_event_listener</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>E</span><span>:</span> <span>Event</span><span>,</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>EventListener</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>/* .. */</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Runs all the registered listeners for the event `E`</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>trigger</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>E</span><span>)</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>E</span><span>:</span> <span>Event</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>/* .. */</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to implement <code>EventDispatcher</code>, we need a data structure that can hold all the listeners. Given an event <code>E</code>, it should provide all the listeners for <code>E</code>. This raises two questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can we associate a listener with a type <code>E</code>?</li>
  <li>How can a single data structure hold listeners for multiple events, which all have different types?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mapping-types-to-values">Mapping types to values</h3>

<p>We will briefly detour to make a critical building block: the <code>TypeMap</code>. Based on our two requirements above, we will make a data structure that a) maps types to values, and b) holds values of different types.</p>

<p>Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/"><code>std::any</code></a> for this purpose. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/struct.TypeId.html"><code>TypeId</code></a> allows us to get a unique, hashable identifier for each type. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/trait.Any.html"><code>Any</code></a> allows us to up-cast/down-cast objects at runtime. Hence, our <code>TypeMap</code> will map from <code>TypeId</code> to <code>Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>collections</span><span>::</span><span>HashMap</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>any</span><span>::{</span><span>TypeId</span><span>,</span> <span>Any</span><span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>TypeMap</span><span>(</span><span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TypeId</span><span>,</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Any</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To add an element to the map:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>TypeMap</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>set</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Any</span> <span>+</span> <span>'static</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.insert</span><span>(</span><span>TypeId</span><span>::</span><span>of</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means our map has one unique value for a given type. For example, if we use the <code>TypeMap</code> like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeMap</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>map</span><span>.set</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aside: the syntax <code>::&lt;i32&gt;</code> is Rust’s “turbofish”. It explicitly binds a type parameter of a polymorphic function, rather than leaving it to be inferred. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52360464/what-is-the-syntax-instance-methodsomething/52361559">Further</a> <a href="https://matematikaadit.github.io/posts/rust-turbofish.html">explanation</a> <a href="https://techblog.tonsser.com/posts/what-is-rusts-turbofish">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we insert a value <code>1</code> at the key <code>TypeId::of::&lt;i32&gt;()</code>. We can also implement <code>has</code> and <code>get</code> functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>TypeMap</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>has</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>'static</span><span>+</span><span>Any</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.contains_key</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>TypeId</span><span>::</span><span>of</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>())</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>'static</span><span>+</span><span>Any</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>TypeId</span><span>::</span><span>of</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>())</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>t</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>t</span><span>.downcast_mut</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
    <span>})</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Look carefully at <code>get_mut</code>. The inner hash map returns a value of type <code>Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;</code>, which we can <code>downcast_mut</code> to become a value of type <code>&amp;mut T</code>. This operation is guaranteed to not fail, because only values of type <code>T</code> are stored in the hash map under the key for <code>T</code>.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-our-event-system">Finishing our event system</h3>

<p>With the <code>TypeMap</code> in hand, we can finish our event system. For the <code>EventDispatcher</code>, the <code>TypeMap</code> will map from events to a vector of listeners.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span><span>(</span><span>TypeMap</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Type alias for a list of listeners for an event</span>
<span>type</span> <span>ListenerVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>EventListener</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>add_event_listener</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>E</span><span>:</span> <span>Event</span><span>,</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>EventListener</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.has</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ListenerVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.set</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ListenerVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>());</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>listeners</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.get_mut</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ListenerVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
    <span>listeners</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When asked to register an event listener, we get the <code>ListenerVec</code> from the <code>TypeMap</code> and insert the new listener. Trigger is similarly simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>trigger</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>:</span> <span>Event</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>listeners</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.get_mut</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ListenerVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>for</span> <span>callback</span> <span>in</span> <span>listeners</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! Now we have a type-safe event system.</p>

<h2 id="type-safe-dependency-injection">Type-safe dependency injection</h2>

<p>To avoid the impression that this pattern is specific to event listeners, I want to show another example of using types-over-strings in extensible architectures. I started playing with <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs">specs</a> recently, an entity-component-system architecture written in Rust. Its <code>System</code> uses a dependency-injection-like pattern, so I wanted to distill that to a pedagogical example here.</p>

<p>Dependency injection systems are often rife with <a href="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/SpringDependencyInjection/article.html">XML files</a>, string keys, and other stringly-typed problems. DI makes for a good use case here.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>The basic idea of dependency injection (DI) is that you have a component that depends on another, like a web server using a database. However, you don’t want to hard-code a particular database constructor, and rather make it easy to swap in different databases. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Database</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>MySQL</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Database</span> <span>for</span> <span>MySQL</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span> <span>{</span> <span>"MySQL"</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>To implement DI, we need two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We need a way to register a global <code>Database</code> at runtime to a particular instance, e.g. <code>MySQL</code> or <code>Postgres</code>.</li>
  <li>We need a way to describe a constructor for <code>WebServer</code> that fetches the registered <code>Database</code> instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these pieces, we can use our DI system like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>manager</span> <span>=</span> <span>DIManager</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>manager</span><span>.build</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MySQL</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>manager</span><span>.build</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>WebServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
<span>server</span><span>.lock</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span><span>.run</span><span>();</span> <span>// prints Db name: MySQL</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="di-constructors">DI constructors</h3>

<p>First, we’ll define a trait <code>DIBuilder</code> that represents a constructor within our DI system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>DIBuilder</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Input</span><span>;</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>

  <span>fn</span> <span>build</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Input</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>build</code> method is a static method (doesn’t take <code>self</code> as input). It just takes <code>Input</code> as input, and produces <code>Output</code> as output. The key idea is that because <code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code> are <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types">associated types</a>, we can inspect them later on. We will need to find values for <code>Input</code> and to store <code>Output</code> in our DI manager.</p>

<p>We implement <code>DIBuilder</code> for each type in the system. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>"Everyone gets the experience. Some get the lesson." T.S. Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to a project is not an easy task, especially if you're new to the project, new to coding in general, or
just not an active contributor.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

                        <p>Lost in the fog of TikTok was an important announcement: Huawei open sourced its homemade mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, now dubbed OpenHarmony. This announcement flew under the radar, but has far-reaching implications to not just the future of mobile technology, but also how that landscape will influence the geopolitical chess match between the U.S. and China.</p><p>But like many things that come out of China, it’s less a game of chess, but more a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg 1000w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/09/huawei-oss-strategy_small-2.jpg 1568w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="openharmony-the-technology">OpenHarmony: the Technology</h2><p>Let’s first get a handle on the technology that underpins OpenHarmony. Because the project started, first in 2012 and intensified in 2019, as a strategic initiative to reduce Huawei’s reliance on the Android operating system due to U.S. sanctions, many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2020/08/28/what-is-huaweis-smartphone-operating-system--should-i-buy-into-it/#4ca0a8311fd7">mistakenly believe</a> it is based on either Android or Linux (of which Android is based). <strong>That’s not true.</strong></p><p>OpenHarmony is based on another open source operating system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>. Interestingly, Apple’s macOS and iOS also leveraged FreeBSD indirectly from another operating system project called Darwin. So, on a bits and bytes level, Huawei’s OpenHarmony is more similar to iOS than Android.</p><p>This is a smart decision because if the whole point is to reduce reliance on Android, the most important thing to avoid is co-mingling code with either Android or Linux in case it triggers obscure licensing restrictions. And the last thing a development team wants is to have technology licensing lawyers checking every line of code the engineers write, especially when they need to develop quickly to avoid an existential crisis, which is what Huawei has right now.</p><p>Because the project is open sourced, there’s a lot one can do now to evaluate and verify OpenHarmony. In fact, I verified the <a href="https://openharmony.gitee.com/openharmony/kernel_liteos_a/blob/master/bsd/arm/autoconf.c">FreeBSD lineage by rummaging through</a> its codebase, which is all hosted on Gitee. For readers who had a chance to read my previous post “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/can-you-nationalize-open-source/"><strong>Can You ‘Nationalize’ Open Source?</strong></a>”, Gitee should sound familiar. It is a Git-based developer collaboration application that was recently anointed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as the domestic “national champion” to drive open source growth in China. <strong>What I didn’t know when I wrote the previous post was that Huawei also became a strategic investor in Gitee in early September via </strong><a href="https://media.qimingpian.cn/qmp/b131b66d760b6b900485a1e30c2762f5.html"><strong>its corporate venture arm, Habo</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>But as every open source technologist can attest, no project ever gets traction without a long period of steadfast community-building and credibility-building. That’s where the OpenAtom Foundation comes in.</p><h2 id="openatom-the-foundation">OpenAtom: the Foundation</h2><p>The OpenAtom Foundation is China’s first non-profit organization of its kind geared towards fostering open source technologies, much in the same way as the Linux Foundation or the Apache Software Foundation. <strong>Huawei drove the founding of this foundation, and OpenHarmony is its anchor project.</strong></p><p>But what is the point of a foundation anyway? As I’ve written in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/covid-open-source-industrial-policy/"><strong>COVID, Open Source, Industrial Policy</strong></a>”, a foundation’s involvement can help open source technologies in two meaningful ways: <strong>accelerate development and vendor neutrality.</strong> In a nutshell, vendor neutrality is important because it allows other large companies to contribute in the development of an open source technology without fearing vendor lock-in by another company, thus leads to faster development of that technology. An example would be Kuberentes, an open source container orchestration software that was first created by Google but is now the anchor project for the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF); Kubernetes’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-and-containers-are-growing-up-fast-survey-shows/">fast growth</a> would not be possible if it still resides within Google.</p><p>While a foundation’s involvement is by no means necessary -- and many open source projects have become popular without a foundation’s support -- it does help. <strong>And that’s what the OpenAtom Foundation is trying to deliver for China’s technology ecosystem. </strong>Its model and value proposition is similar to that of the Linux Foundation: basically <strong>delivering foundation (thus neutrality) as a service</strong> to open source projects, including legal, IP trademark management, licensing, community building, joint marketing, etc.</p><p>An open source foundation is successful when it builds an ecosystem of technologies around the anchor project with a coherent theme. The Linux Foundation, of course, built an ecosystem around Linux with many ancillary and adjacent technologies around the “open source operating system” theme. &nbsp;The CNCF (a subsidiary foundation of the Linux Foundation) <a href="https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/README.md#trail-map">built an ecosystem</a> of technologies around Kubernetes and the “cloud-native” theme.</p><p>While the OpenAtom Foundation is <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">already hosting seven projects</a> as part of its launch, with a lofty goal of fostering open source software, hardware, semiconductors, and content (I’m assuming documentation and technical education), the only theme seems to be that all projects were created by Chinese companies. And besides OpenHarmony, whose strategic value to Huawei is clear, the other technologies seem trivial to their original creators:</p><ul><li><strong>Xuperchain</strong>, a blockchain infrastructure project from <strong>Baidu</strong></li><li><strong>TKEStack</strong> (a container orchestration layer based on Kubernetes) and <strong>TencentOS</strong> (an energy-efficient IoT operating system) from <strong>Tencent</strong></li><li><strong>AliOS</strong> (a light-weight IoT operating system) from <strong>Alibaba</strong></li><li><strong>PIKA</strong> (a storage system based on the open source database, Redis) from <strong>Qihoo360</strong></li><li><strong>UBML</strong> (a Unified Business Modeling Language modeling system) from <strong>Netease</strong><br></li></ul><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/73XjJgCZnhJYxnCW4L8XjLFa9FHQbxAz7nYWTWmaGAsUVSW-L7TH7BurSGCj-H1sc2PnemuL2tuzm16EM7vxtBs8ydPAhQSHCHnsMidVpguJhBaU6hVavLasls45i76RPVNyGFbZ" alt=""></figure><p>If I have to surmise a future theme that is technology-focused and not nationality-focused, it would be IoT because when OpenHarmony was first unveiled in 2019 (as HarmonyOS), it was an IoT-focused operating system, like TencentOS and AliOS. But since then, its scope has broadened to include support for smartphones, watches, and smart TVs.</p><p>One other curious element about OpenAtom is that <strong>only two projects</strong> (OpenHarmony, TencentOS) are hosted on the “national champion”, <strong>Gitee</strong>, while <strong>four others</strong> (AliOS, PIKA, Xuperchain, TKE) are on <strong>GitHub</strong>. The remaining one, UBML from Netease, requires a developer to fill out a form to apply for access, which is a very developer-<em><strong>un</strong></em>friendly way to run an open source project.</p><h2 id="technology-foundation-developer-approval">Technology + Foundation = Developer Approval?</h2><p>That’s the hope anyway. The nirvana of an open source technology, with or without a foundation, is to achieve widespread participation and buy-in among developers, who will both make use of the technology at scale and contribute to its development. And if an <em>experienced</em> foundation gets involved to leverage its best practices in open source management, it can increase the success rate by reducing much of the messiness and common mistakes that often plague young open source projects.</p><p>In the case of Huawei though, <strong>OpenHarmony is a young project, and OpenAtom is an even younger foundation.</strong></p><p>The lazy and obvious conclusion here is to just dismiss all these efforts as a fool’s errand. <strong>But that’s not what you came to Interconnected for. </strong>The honest and nuanced conclusion is: <strong>it’s too early to tell and there are trends working both against and for Huawei’s open source strategy.</strong></p><h3 id="factors-against">Factors Against</h3><p>Huawei is infamous for its secretive ownership structure. Nobody knows exactly who or what owns Huawei. It’s a private Chinese LLC. It’s employee-owned, with 98.99% of company shares controlled by its employees via a “trade union committee”. Allegedly, this committee pays dues to more senior trade unions in an opaque bureaucracy that ultimately leads to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (thus all the controversy). That’s why <a href="https://interconnected.blog/why-huawei-should-ipo-in-america/">I’ve advocated for Huawei to IPO in New York</a> -- a bold act that would bring some desperately-needed credibility to the company.</p><p>Along the same vein, the OpenAtom Foundation also needs transparent, credible governance of its projects <em>and itself</em>. It currently boasts a 16-member Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), a typical governing element of an open source foundation, with Chinese technologists who have had years of experience working on projects in the Apache Software Foundation and Mozilla Foundation -- a good start. Their decision making process will have to be public and transparent to earn credibility from the wide developer community, both within and outside of China. As a reference, the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/">CNCF TOC’s every governing deliberation</a> is viewable and commentable on GitHub. Because OpenAtom is, after all, a China-registered entity, to what degree it can deliver pure transparency is questionable.</p><p>Lastly, OpenHarmony’s birthright as a Chinese creation makes building neutrality and credibility harder than just about any other birthright on the planet. <strong>This is an obvious yet important point that every Chinese company is struggling with right now. It is an element that every Chinese immigrant living abroad has been struggling with for much longer. </strong>For a young project, OpenHarmony does have reasonably good documentation in both English and Chinese -- an important first step that must be continued for the long haul. Maintaining a bilingual presence (much like this blog) requires lots of extra hard work -- work that an American-born, German-born, or French-born project does not have to do. <strong>None of us can pick where we are born, but we all have to deal with its uneven consequences. There is no point in pretending that doesn’t exist.</strong></p><h3 id="factors-for">Factors For</h3><p>It’s not all doom and gloom for Huawei; there are a couple of factors potentially working in its favor. For one, the U.S.’s own credibility and neutrality when regulating cross-border technology businesses is also deteriorating. The Trump administration’s wheeling and dealing of TikTok is nothing short of cronyism, so much so that it has been called out by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-tiktok-and-crony-capitalism-11600639766?mod=hp_opin_pos_2">none other than the WSJ editorial board</a>. Although this doesn’t mean Huawei will have an opening to re-enter the U.S. market, other parts of the world may be more receptive to its technology. Regions like Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are all credible possibilities.

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>upper_bound</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>    lower_bound    │     upper_bound</span>

<span>1.2511263318488451 │ 7.4155403348178215</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The range we defined is one standard deviation from the mean. Any value outside this range is considered an anomaly:</p>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WITH</span> <span>series</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WITH</span> <span>series</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>If you have ever come across<a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/"> The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, you probably know the man behind it,<a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz"> Gergely Orosz</a>. More than a simple blog, or newsletter, it is a treasure trove of knowledge on the ins and outs of Engineering, Engineering Management and, in general, all things leadership in tech. As the website name implies, Gergely is all about pragmatism and helping engineering leaders develop themselves, while delivering massive value to their companies and those around them.</p><figure><img src="https://evolutionarymanager.com/content/images/2020/09/orosz-resized-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Gergely Orosz</figcaption></figure><p>Exploring the interface between Product and Engineering, and building world-class Engineering teams are two interrelated topics that we both share as interests. For that reason, I invited Gergely for a chat with me to continue the discussion I started here in an<a href="https://evolutionarymanager.com/chasing-agile-rainbow/"> earlier conversation</a> with my good friend<a href="https://twitter.com/kettiby"> Mohammed Rizwan</a>.</p><p><strong>Gergely, thanks for joining me. Tell us a little about yourself and your background.</strong></p><p>I've been in engineering for more than a decade, starting at smaller companies, but then joined JP Morgan where I worked for a year. JP Morgan was more an investment bank than a tech company but I learned a lot about finance. Then I moved to Skype, which had just been acquired by Microsoft and we were building Skype for Xbox One in London, collaborating with the Xbox team in Redmond. That was a really good experience, working with a US-based company but from Europe. Then I moved to Skyscanner, where I built a small mobile team, building a B2B travel tool.</p><p>Finally, I moved to Uber, which has been a really good learning so far. I joined the Amsterdam office when it was about 25 engineers, and three years later we were up to 150, essentially almost doubling every year. I actually joined as an engineer – which gave me the opportunity of knowing the codebase – did that for 6 months and then became a manager. Eventually, I started leading multiple teams and managed my first manager in a bigger group. Initially, my team owned everything payments in the Rider app but now we've transitioned to a platform based approach. I would call it a platform-focused team with product impact.</p><p><strong>That's actually a good segue into the first question. How do you think about understanding the value of what the teams build and deciding what to work on?</strong></p><p>When I joined Uber, we changed directions more frequently based on new priorities coming fromTravis Kalanick, like adding tipping to the app. This time was very much about growth and making bold decisions. Now, with Dara as CEO and the business environment maturing, I would actually compare it to how Amazon operates, with a focus on efficiency, getting to profitability and operational excellence.</p><p>At some point, I started to put my foot down on not starting to work on a project that did not have some sort of impact estimated. Uber is big on data driven decisions, with lots of data scientists, and PMs typically pair with them. So we'd estimate impact on everything and then just stack-rank it. This, by the way, doesn't necessarily have to be dollars. With tech debt work, engineers often say we should refactor this API, for example. Well, what's the impact? If it's a system that's going to be retired or has little to no users, then the impact will be meaningless. So you have to ask yourself: are we saving money? Is it about reliability? Is it reducing frustration? Often people will say, "You know what? You're right, it doesn't make sense". Or, "Holy Moly! This has impact on so many people".</p><p>One example of not using dollars to make business decisions was how a Developer Experience team made the case that 6-core Macbooks would compile the mobile app 30% faster, shaving off around a minute for each compilation. Multiply that by 400 engineers, each doing a few builds per day, and it adds up to a lot. This is how this team upgrading to better hardware for mobile engineers at the company. I found this data-driven approach eye-opening...</p><p><strong>A key element of high-performance in tech teams is visibility into how the team operates and therefore the ability to surface issues earlier. How do you think about this in the context of your teams?</strong></p><p>A lot of people are doing the whole JIRA thing, looking at story points and velocity. I personally am not a huge fan of deferring to these metrics. To me, first you need a spec that makes it clear what the work is and why it’s important. Not many things are formalized at Uber, but two things are: first, the product requirements specification, owned by the product managers, which also needs to be signed off by the business. In the past,I have seen projects built where legal later came in and stopped the launch. In that case, months of work went to waste. Another thing we do is an engineering plan, no matter how lightweight it may be.</p><p>My approach then is to think more in terms of milestones rather than sprints. For example, we had this massive project building Skype for Xbox from the ground up. We broke down a year-long project to four milestones: something like audio, video, chat and production-ready. And regardless of JIRA and boards, the question was always: what is the next milestone? And what can we do about it? So until audio calling were not working, we weren't doing anything on video. Everyone swarmed, helping get audio up and running first. I like to replicate this teamwork focused on finishing the current milestone.</p><p>Also for visibility, and because I believe in helping people grow into more leadership roles, I typically ask the teams to write up a weekly email update, including maybe one or two stakeholders, describing current progress. This pushes accountability on the teams, acting as a sort of contract I like to have. And it helps you stay focused on what the next milestone is.</p><p><strong>Love the clarity in that. Another aspect I find critical is the ability to change, both in terms of the code and the teams themselves. How do you look at maintaining "changeability" in the face of extreme growth?</strong></p><p>At Uber, where I've been for the past 4 years, a good chunk of time has been spent on<a href="https://lethain.com/migrations/"> migrations</a>, just because we grew so fast. For example, many of our old systems were built on the assumption that we'd be doing Rides only, and now you have Eats and Freight and other new businesses. In an environment like this you just have to get good at migrations. When you start doing it a lot, you learn what the costs are and how to do it well.</p><p>I think people sometimes <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-architecture-is-overrated/">overthink architecture</a>, and spend far too much time on this area, upfronts. You can try to build all these beautiful systems that are easy to customize and extend but that really is an unrealistic goal. My two cents is that infrastructure is more important than architecture: when it's easy to deploy, monitor, spin up a new service – and Uber is a good example of this – you end up with thousands of microservices because it's just so easy to do it. So you can build a service with monitoring and start moving things over. That's not possible if it's really hard to set things up with data included. So I would say, focus on infrastructure and worry less about maintainability.</p><p>The other thing about changeability is that struggling organizations usually have leaders who haven't gone through the “migration hell” of a fast-growing organization before. But if you don't act in tackling your tech debt, you'll start to have churn and you can lose your best engineers over a matter of years. So next time around, as a leader you're going to put your foot down and maybe you'll be at a VP or CTO level position. At Uber, I observed our CTO understanding this and creating time for engineering to tackle tech debt that was caused by the fast growth. For example, the whole company did Fixit Weeks - a week to tackle tech debt - and engineering foundations work was prioritized at the company level. You can, of course, do a lot of this bottom-up but if people at the top don't appreciate the importance of it, as an engineer, you're bound to get frustrated.</p><p><strong>Wade Chambers, a former VP Engineering at Twitter, once said the role of any Engineering Manager is to win and to increase your capacity to win. It resonated with me a lot in terms of continuous improvement. How do you promote that explicitly within your teams?</strong></p><p>I find that when a new team comes together, they learn really fast. If you just give them a basic framework, and you're solving new problems and you reflect on them and how you did it, you improve a lot. Autonomy helps greatly as well. Instead of getting a project manager who'll tell everybody what to do, I <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-team-where-everyone-is-a-leader/">give that autonomy to the engineers</a>, with some guardrails. So the people in my teams tend to eventually all become pretty decent project managers.</p><p>Continuous improvement comes from pushing teams to commit, giving them space to fail and then ensuring there's reflection on what happened and what we should change. So that's one way to grow. The second thing is being ruthless about not doing manual work. In most cases, either figure out how to automate it or don't do it, which might require thinking outside the box.</p><p>I tell people that I'm always accountable for what we do, and our projects, which means that if someone should get in trouble or get fired, that someone should be me, the engineering manager. And in return, I ask others to take on responsibility for their work. Hopefully, this creates an environment where failure is not a problem but something we can learn from. Whatever happens, as long as someone tells me what they've learned and how they're going to change things, I'm super happy. And, by the way, there's this great book about this mindset called<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404"> <em>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders</em></a><em>. </em>I recommend this book for people to read.</p><p>So, in the end, continuous improvement boils down to "forcing" or encouraging people to think on their feet, come up with suggestions and have them follow through with it. I'm curious about …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>During the covid-19 crisis, The birth of the first open source data enabled ventilator. </p><article>
      
<p>Back to March 20, 2020. <a href="https://twitter.com/waxzce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Adam</a>, with some friends living in Nantes, is trying to build a ventilator prototype with 3D printing and Arduino, in response to a shortage of equipment. </p>



<p><strong>Project MakAir is started</strong>. </p>



<p>Quentin, a software expert, is struggling with the electronics part and looking for electronics engineers. Among his friends is Mathias, SenX CTO. That is how Mathias asked me to review the electronics part of the project. My first call with Quentin was to help him connect an old pressure sensor to an Arduino, during the late evening of March 20.</p>



<p><strong>The goal was clear: to mass-produce an open-source medical ventilator</strong>. Crazy! Looking at the project that day, it looked like an "amateur" project. So I did the first real schematics, the first BOM, the first Radiospares, and Farnell reference list during the weekend, discussing with more and more people on the MakAir Slack. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Amateur? Not really...</h3>



<p>Next Thursday, I understood that the small "amateur" project is quickly getting big. Two electronics companies detached people, and a whole regulatory team was up. In this team, there were some experts in medical devices. We also knew that we were in a shortlist of projects that the French government is looking at closely.</p>



<p>I soon realized that in Nantes, there is no one able to actually make the prototypes. <a href="https://blog.senx.io/connecting-a-beertender-to-warp-10-using-mqtt-on-lorawan-with-thethingsnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engineers with prototyping knowledge</a> are scarce, I just know a few of them like me. So, on the 25th during the evening, in a few minutes, I convinced Cherine, a former Renault Sport colleague living near Paris who has the same knowledge of prototyping as me, to join the project as well.</p>



<p><strong>On the 26th, I joined the MakAir core team, choosing to confine myself with 17 other people to make project MakAir a reality</strong>. Cherine came from Paris the same day I came from Brest. At the same time in France, 100 people were already helping us remotely. </p>



<p>I brought with me all my personal tools, from soldering iron to oscilloscope, and tons of components. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>If I had been told this would last 25 days, I would have brought more than 3 days of clothing!</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Three days later, <strong>the <a href="http://www.cea.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEA</a></strong> (french government agency for atomic energy) is now supporting us. On the 31<sup>st</sup> of March, we all moved from Nantes to Grenoble CEA facility, traveling on a nearly empty motorway.</p>



<p>The first prototype had basic electronics: STM32 Nucleo, a small 4 lines screen, a few buttons, a good precision pressure sensor, and several servo outputs. <strong>This first prototype allows us to make a pig breath for 4 hours</strong> on the 3rd of April, only 2 weeks after the project started.</p>

<h2>Enters the Raspberry Pi</h2>



<p>What we learned from the first test on a pig:</p>



<ul><li>The ventilator did the job. The pig was alive and woke up correctly.</li><li><strong>There is a huge UX problem.</strong></li><li>The air flow measurement is really helpful.</li></ul>



<p>The experts from the medical world are now used to high-tech screens displaying curves with not only pressure, but real-time air volume blown into the patient lungs. Even in crisis time, we understand that our product does not meet their minimum UI/UX needs.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="418" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-1024x418.jpg" alt="difference of UX between first MakAir screen and a recent ventilator" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-1024x418.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-300x123.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-768x314.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4-1536x627.jpg 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4.jpg 1660w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Makair prototype on the left, a recent ventilator on the right. <br>Both can save life, but UX gap is huge!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Always listen to the users. Even if we succeed in mass production of an open-source ventilator, if doctors want curves and measure of the number of air liters entering the lungs, we must do it. </p>



<p>Since the beginning, this project is time driven. We never consider the price, but we always look at worldwide stocks. In a time where lots of plants are closed in Europe, <strong>the supply chain is leading the project.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited.jpg" alt="inside the v1 of the MakAir" width="522" height="347" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited.jpg 1378w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC_6374-edited-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"><figcaption>Scooter lead-acid batteries. Because these are the most available batteries in the word.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, what is the world's most available touch screen? </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="farnell stocks" width="616" height="217" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png 832w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2-768x270.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px"><figcaption>(and 18000 more at radiospares)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As I just said, the supply chain rules the project. MakAir will have a raspberry to display curves. Nice coincidence for an open-source project!</p>



<p>By the way, the mass flow meter sensor was a huge problem. Since the beginning, MakAir did not want to disturb the production of existing ventilators. But this component is on the air way, it should be approved for medical use. In April, it was impossible to source any Sensirion or Honeywell mass flow sensors... Anyway, the next test will be done with a raspberry connected to the STM32. </p>







<h2>Enter Warp&nbsp;10</h2>



<p>On the 17th of April, the first batch of ventilators built in the CEA clean-rooms was ready. This batch was used for the 1st clinical tests. </p>



<p><strong>The pressure switches from the technical team to the regulatory team, remotely working on the project since the beginning. </strong></p>



<p>To prepare the next batch, we came back to Nantes. After 25 days, we switched from commando mode (18h/day, 7 days a week) to a more standard week (14h/day, the weekends with the family).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-1024x768.jpg" alt="MakAir team in the CEA cleanroom with prototypes" width="521" height="390" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_5752.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px"><figcaption>Tyvek sterile clothing in a cleanroom. Could not be better for medical device assembly. Thanks to the CEA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> of April, the prototype with a raspberry pi is ready for the next animal test. Two people had to fly to Grenoble CEA with this prototype, but the rest of us, and all the people remotely working on the project wanted to follow the experience. </p>



<p>So, the night before the test, I quickly deployed Warp&nbsp;10 on the raspberry and wrote a small script to copy data every 10s to another Warp&nbsp;10 server.</p>



<p>What is <a href="https://www.warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a>? It is a time series platform. But unlike other TSDB (Time Series Database), there is a full analysis environment behind, and even a task scheduler. Compress time series, replicate to another server while managing network outage is really easy. Same tooling on the server and the connected object, that what I call easy IoT. To stream data, you just need a few WarpScript functions among <a href="https://www.warp10.io/doc/functionList" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the thousand available</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the WarpScript pseudo code is:</p>



<pre><code>- Read the last value of makair.lastupload GTS
- take the last tick as start
- take now as end
- fetch locally all the makair GTS from start to end
- WRAP all the GTS
- build a script that UNWRAP and UPDATE the data
- do a remote execution of the script with REXEC 
- if the REXEC was a success, store end in makair.lastupload</code></pre>



<p>You can follow the <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/04_Tutorials/01_WarpScript/30_Server_to_Server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server to server tutorial</a> to implement such a WarpScript, then save it as $WARP10HOME/warpscripts/makair/10000/upload_data.mc2 to schedule an execution every 10s.</p>



<p>To display data in real-time, <a href="http://studio.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpStudio</a> did the job easily too. Autorefresh of the DataViz every 10s is a built-in function:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3.png" alt="autorefresh settings of the MakAir test" width="522" height="385" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3.png 575w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"><figcaption>In the dataviz tab of WarpStudio.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>Around 30 lines of code to allow all the MakAir team to follow the pressure inside the pig lungs in real-time!</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>MakAir ventilators are designed to store everything in the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a> time series database. They also have built-in WiFi and LoRa. All these features are not yet available, because the priority is still to make an open-source approved ventilator. </p>

<p>Connected features + open-source software is an enabler for doctors and researchers to perform extensive data collection and try new algorithms in the machine. Warp&nbsp;10 is the best open source time series database to <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-for-iot-gdpr-compliant-before-gdpr-even-existed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">securely</a> store medical data and analyze it. It's not a walled garden.</p>



<p>If you need to connect medical devices to a time series database, <a href="mailto:contact@senx.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just ask us</a>.</p>



<p>MakAir is now entering the second phase of clinical tests. We can consider we are half way to the goal. Keep in mind that among all the projects of ventilators announced by big companies, MakAir is the only one to reach the clinical tests step. <a href="https://makair.life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 people, backed up by CEA and a few french companies</a> are about to make a commercially available open source ventilator... </p>



<p>That's crazy when you think about it!</p>

<p>For the past three years, I’ve been writing about SmartNICs. One of my most popular blog posts is “<a href="https://technologyevangelist.co/2017/07/17/whats-a-smart-nic/">What is a SmartNIC</a>” from July 2017, which has been read over 6,000 times. This year, for the second time, I’ve presented at the Storage Developer Conference (SDC). The title for this blog post was also the title of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGmo3M0vLsI">breakout session video</a>, which ran for 50 minutes, and went live earlier this week. Here is the abstract for that session:</p>



<blockquote><p>Since the advent of the Smart Phone over a decade ago, we’ve seen several new “Smart” technologies, but few have had a significant impact on the data center until now. SmartNICs and SmartSSDs will change the landscape of the data center, but what comes next? This talk will summarize the state of the SmartNIC market by classifying and discussing the technologies behind the leading products in the space. Then it will dive into the emerging technology of SmartSSDs and how they will change the face of storage and solutions. Finally, we’ll dive headfirst into the impact of PCIe 5 and Compute Express Link (CXL) on the future of Smart Acceleration on solution delivery.</p><cite>—<a href="https://www.snia.org/events/storage-developer/2020/abstracts#computational-Schweitzer">Scott Schweitzer</a>, The Technology Evangelist, Xilinx, Sept 2020</cite></blockquote>



<p>In that talk, which has been seen by over 100 people in just the first 24-hours alone on YouTube (I’m told this doesn’t include conference attendees), I shared much of what I’ve learned over the past few months while producing the following new items on SmartNICs:</p>

<p>I’ve had my “official” personal email address for 14 years now. I use it everywhere, it speaks my name, but it now unfortunately has to go wherever email addresses go when they’re not used anymore.</p>

<p>The main reason why I’m letting my e-mail address go is because I don’t own it, I can’t rent it and I’m only <em>allowed</em> to use it. And it’s connected to basically every service I use, especially my banking or utilities or shopping. My doctors send me notes to my e-mail address. It controls my entire online presence. And it can be taken away without reason or appeal.</p>

<p>It’s also the worst kind of vendor lock-in. I’ve created and used this address many years before the company decided they’d better business if they peaked through my e-mails and saved them in a weirdly structured way, which they may or may not sell to other people.</p>

<p>I also don’t own my phone number but, as opposed to my e-mail address</p>

<p>Which leads me to:</p>

<h3 id="we-should-be-able-to-port-our-e-mail-addresses-the-same-way-we-port-telephone-numbers">We should be able to port our e-mail addresses the same way we port telephone numbers</h3>

<p>There’re various levels of legislation about what <em>e-mails</em> one can receive, but nothing about actual e-mail <em>addresses</em>. There’s nothing protecting the user in that regard. Did the small robot at Big E-mail Company decide to block the access to your e-mail address? Tough titty said the kitty.</p>

<p><em>Everybody should be able to change e-mail services without having to change their e-mail address. Companies providing email services should be specifically registered as such, and they should follow a fixed set of rules made to measure the importance e-mail addresses have for users. And this should apply for both paid email services and services that offer various degrees of free plans.</em></p>

<p>It’s not a technical walk in the park, but not impossible to implement either. Most important, it’s in the benefit of the user. There’s no way of having an internet presence without an e-mail address as there’s no other unique and personal identifier you can use when creating an account anywhere. People have tried usernames and it didn’t quite work out and phone numbers were not as loved (for some strange reason).</p>

<p>For most email services I tried, you have the possibility of moving the e-mails from other services to them. So it’s relatively easy to move your emails around, just not your e-mail address.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-alternative-right-now">What’s the alternative right now?</h3>

<p>There’s only one thing you can do: buy your own domain and use it with an e-mail service. By owning* your domain, you own your e-mail address, and you can take it with you and nobody else has a say in that. But this requires a certain, albeit small, degree of technical savviness: you have to point the domain to the e-mail service.</p>

<p>Once you have your e-mail address, just start shopping for email services and you’ll be pleasantly surprised. It’s really great choosing what you need and not what’s given to you: maybe you’d like your e-mails to be hosted in Europe or you need lots of gigabytes available. Or maybe you just like having a real live person on the other end to talk to when you have problems. Did the service suck after 6 months or didn’t deliver? Did your needs change? Just move on to another. Should take less than half an hour.</p>

<p>As for me, I’ve started the long road of switching to my new address. I’m revisiting all my accounts, deleting the ones I don’t need and updating the other. However, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to completely delete the old address. 14 years is a long time and there’s many more people/places that have my address than I can remember. I’ll probably forward that address forever to my new address. Or anyway, until someone, human or not, decides to zap it.</p>

<ul>
<li>You don’t own a domain either, but, as phone numbers, someone can’t just take it away</li>
</ul>

<p>At Japanese Complete we are hard at work inventing the present and the future for Japanese mastery, and now we have a daily cumulative quiz for our learners to take.</p>



<p>Japanese Complete is a curriculum designed on top of a frequency analysis of Japanese in the wild (the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese from 2011) and is assembled by experienced bilingual and trilingual teachers.</p>



<p>And now, learners take a cumulative quiz each day that is drawn from all the material they’ve seen so far in Japanese Complete!  </p>

<p>Now you can have a reason to do a quick review every day.  This goes along with our general advice of “a little every day is better than a lot all at once.”  True for both meditation and language learning.</p>



<h2>What do the quizzes cover?</h2>



<p>Every chapter of Japanese Complete teaches new Kanji, Verbs, and Particles.   The quizzes cover all three groups and are based on our method of generous English Context (“Japanese in English Context”) to help learners associate complex meaning structures with basic Japanese grammar, without needing to know lots of Japanese nouns.</p>



<p>In general, we find that our radical new approach to teaching Japanese based on frequency and grammar is incredibly good at bringing new learners up to speed and giving them “Japanese-eyes” for the language <strong>—</strong> hyper-recognition of particles, verbs, and a strong sense of familiarity and meaning with visited kanji.</p>



<p>You can read more about that at our seminal post <a href="https://learn-japanese.org/2019/10/10/habits-of-successful-language-learners/">“Habits of Successful Language Learners”</a></p>

  		<p>We've recently gotten TLS functional for embedded systems in Rust. 
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is one of the backbones to secure communications over TCP/IP, helping protect data in-flight between two parties.
There's a lot of moving parts involved in bringing easy-to-use functional cryptography to small 32-bit ARM Cortex-M devices. 
Let's dive in, shall we?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p><strong>Warning: This will be a long and winding blogpost. Grab a cup of coffee.</strong></p>

<p>One of the primary rules in cryptography is <em>never write your own cryptography</em>.
There's a lot of smart people already writing crypto libraries, and also a lot of smart people who are happy to poke holes in your hand-rolled crypto.</p>
<p>Thankfully, ARM has created <a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedTLS</a> and donated it to <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/">TrustedFirmware.org</a>.
That sounds perfect, yeah?</p>
<p>The downside of <em>mbedTLS</em> is that it's written in C, and is able to target not only embedded platforms, but also fully POSIX-compliance large host systems,
which means it is <em>highly configurable</em> and not immediately useful to Rust developers.</p>

<p>Rust <em>does</em> provide mechanisms for calling into libraries written in C. 
They are inherently <code>unsafe</code> because Rust, rightly, can't trust a library written in C to understand things like <em>lifetimes</em> and Rust's own memory model.</p>
<p>So normally, you find yourself with a <code>-sys</code> crate that simply builds the C library, and then wrap that with a Rust crate that provides better safety and semantics.</p>
<p>Then there's issues such as "Rust strings are valid UTF-8 and know their length" and "C strings are a sequence of bytes followed by a null", which complicates matters.</p>
<h2 id="the-drogue-tls-sys-crate">The <code>drogue-tls-sys</code> crate</h2>
<p>The first order of business is simply building the mbedTLS library, appropriately configured for an ARM Cortex-M embedded device which lacks things like filesystems, a real-time clock or <code>printf()</code>.</p>
<p>Everything configurable with mbedTLS is done through a <code>config.h</code> file they ship, defining or undefining a variety of macros which indicate what facilities your platform supports.</p>
<p>By telling mbedTLS that our platform doesn't support traditional things like <code>calloc(..)</code>/<code>free(...)</code> or <code>snprintf(...)</code>,  mbedTLS gives us a way to register function-pointers to those types of things for our platform.  <em>C function pointers</em>.</p>
<h3 id="let-s-look-at-calloc">Let's look at <code>calloc(...)</code></h3>
<p>Once we configure it, mbedTLS gives us this function:</p>
<pre><code><span>int </span><span>mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free</span><span>( </span><span>void </span><span>* (*calloc_func)( size_t, size_t ),
                                      </span><span>void </span><span>(*free_func)( </span><span>void </span><span>* ) );
</span></code></pre>
<p>This allows us to register functions that behave as <code>calloc(...)</code> and <code>free(...)</code>, allocating and freeing memory on the heap.</p>
<p>By default, embedded Rust doesn't have a heap.</p>
<p>You can install an allocator to give you a heap, but then you also have to install an allocation error handler, which unfortunately is an unstable <em>nightly-only</em> feature of Rust.</p>
<p>How do we solve this?</p>
<p>We fork <a href="https://crates.io/crates/alloc-cortex-m">alloc-cortex-m</a>, and a bit of the Rust alloc crates <a href="https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-tls/tree/master/drogue-tls/src/platform">into our tree</a>.</p>
<p>The only reason we have to fork them is because using them directly triggers <code>rustc</code> into being convinced we have a global allocator and need to install the allocation error handler, which as noted above, is nightly-only.</p>
<h4 id="allocation-in-rust">Allocation in Rust</h4>
<p>Rust does allocation using a <code>Layout</code> which basically embodies the size of memory you request, along with adjustments for accomodate memory alignment for your platform.
Rust also wants the <em>exact same layout</em> passed in when you deallocate memory, unlike C's <code>free(...)</code> which only needs a pointer to the memory, because it put the layout information in a header of the initial allocation.</p>
<p>How do we solve that? The same way C does, by not expecting the caller to track the layout information, but by scribbling it into the start of the allocation ourselves, also.</p>
<p>If mbedTLS needs 16 bytes allocated, it'll call <code>calloc(1, 16)</code> to ask for 1 chunk of 16 bytes.</p>
<p>To that, we add 8 bytes for our book-keeping header, so the allocation will ultimately become 24 bytes. The extra 8 bytes track 2 <code>usize</code> slots for our book-keeping: 1 for the size of the allocation (24 bytes total) and one for the alignment requirements. Since our header takes the first 8 bytes, we return the pointer to the 9th byte, which starts the chunk of 16 bytes requested by the caller of <code>calloc(...)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>byte |0   |1   |2   |3   |4   |5   |6   |7   |8+
     |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------------
 use |alloc_size         |alignment          |handed back to caller  
</span></code></pre>
<p>When <code>free(...)</code> is called with only a pointer from C code, we back-track 8 bytes, read out the size and alignment values and rebuild our <code>Layout</code> to shuffle on into Rust's allocator's <code>dealloc(...)</code> method.</p>
<p>This allows us to avoid any external book-keeping, and just tacking an extra 8 bytes onto the head of each allocation.</p>
<h2 id="bindgen">Bindgen</h2>
<p>So far we've glossed over how we <em>actually</em> interface from Rust to C and back.</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bindgen">bindgen</a>, which consumes C header files and produces <code>unsafe</code> Rust bindings to the API. </p>
<p>Since Rust has no concept of <code>null</code>, but C pointers can certainly be null, each pointer tends to get wrapped in a <code>Option</code> on the Rust side.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>extern "C"</code> syntax to write a function in Rust that can be called from C with the appropriate calling conventions. </p>
<pre><code><span>extern </span><span>"</span><span>C</span><span>" </span><span>fn </span><span>platform_calloc_f</span><span>(</span><span>count</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>size</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>*mut</span><span> c_void {
  </span><span>// do the Layout and allocation dance described above
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bindgen's processing of mbedTLS also provides us a Rust-callable function <code>platform_set_calloc_free(...)</code> exposed by mbedTLS. 
This is where we finally wire stuff up.
But, it's an <code>unsafe</code> function that takes function pointers as arguments, so we have to wrap the invocation of it in an <code>unsafe { ... }</code> block, and wrap our functions in an <code>Option::Some(...)</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>unsafe </span><span>{ </span><span>platform_set_calloc_free</span><span>(Some(platform_calloc_f), Some(platform_free_f)) };
</span></code></pre>
<p>And now we've <em>finally</em> provided mbedTLS the ability to allocate and deallocate some heap-ish memory.</p>
<h2 id="variadics">Variadics</h2>
<p>When working with TLS and doing FFI in general, you need to be able to debug what's actually going on, particular in the two weeks you're banging your head on the table trying to figure out how it all works.
Just like <code>calloc(...)</code> above, mbedTLS allows you to pass in a debug logging function. 
The problem is that the things the debug logging function prints tend to be constructed using variants of <code>sprintf(...)</code>, which is a <em>variadic</em> function, meaning it can take an unlimited number of arguments to populate the formatting string.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code><span>printf</span><span>("</span><span>%s</span><span> says </span><span>%s %d</span><span> times</span><span>", bob_str, hi_str, </span><span>42</span><span>);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Would print out "Bob says Hi 42 times".</p>
<p>Stable Rust does not support variadics.</p>
<p>In our case, the two important methods are <code>snprintf(...)</code> which is a true variadic function, and <code>vsnprintf(...)</code> which is slightly less variadic, in that there's an argument that points to the remainder argument list.</p>
<p>It's trivial to write an implementation of <code>snprintf(...)</code> in C that delegates to <code>vsnprintf(...)</code> which <em>can</em> then be implemented, non-variadically, in Rust.</p>
<pre><code><span>extern int </span><span>snprintf</span><span>(</span><span>char </span><span>* </span><span>restrict </span><span>str</span><span>, size_t </span><span>size</span><span>, </span><span>const char </span><span>* </span><span>restrict </span><span>fmt</span><span>, ...) {
    va_list ap;
    </span><span>int</span><span> n;

    </span><span>va_start</span><span>(ap,fmt);
    n=</span><span>vsnprintf</span><span>(str,size,fmt,ap);
    </span><span>va_end</span><span>(ap);

    </span><span>return</span><span> n;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>va_start(...)</code> macro ultimately populates the <code>ap</code> variable with a pointer to the arguments. 
The arguments are really viewed as an opaque blob of memory, so you must analyze the <code>printf</code> formatting string to know how to treat the bytes behind that pointer.</p>
<p>We've create the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/drogue-ffi-compat">drogue-ffi-compat</a> crate to help deal with that memory interpretation.</p>
<pre><code><span>#[</span><span>no_mangle</span><span>]
</span><span>pub extern </span><span>"</span><span>C</span><span>" </span><span>fn </span><span>vsnprintf</span><span>(
    </span><span>str</span><span>: </span><span>*mut u8</span><span>,
    </span><span>size</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>,
    </span><span>format</span><span>: </span><span>*const u8</span><span>,
    </span><span>ap</span><span>: va_list,
) -&gt; </span><span>i32 </span><span>{
    </span><span>let mut</span><span> va_list = VaList::from(ap);
    </span><span>// use the Rust VaList now
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, if you process the <code>printf</code> formatting string and see a <code>%d</code> you know the next argument is an <code>i32</code> in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> value: </span><span>i32 </span><span>= va_list.va_arg::&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;();
</span></code></pre>
<p>If it's followed by a <code>%c</code> you know you can safely interpret the following argument as a character:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> value: </span><span>char </span><span>= va_list.va_arg::&lt;</span><span>char</span><span>&gt;();
</span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, things will go woefully wrong if you don't have a <code>printf</code> formatting string to guide you through walking the <code>va_list</code> values.</p>
<p>The <code>drogue-ffi-compat</code> crate thankfully includes Just Enough printf formatting string processing to debug mbedTLS.</p>
<p>Just like registering our <code>calloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> implementation with mbedTLS, we can now register our <code>snprintf()</code> and <code>vsnprintf()</code> implementations the same way, using similar functions (not pictured, because yeesh, this is getting long).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/drogue-tls">drogue-tls</a> crate handily wraps up all the machinations above into a <em>safe</em> and more semantic API for dealing with TLS.
It provides an associated function to initialize the system and it sets up the debug logging, etc, and then provides a <code>TcpStack</code> for doing network operations.</p>

<p>Remember, we're doing this so we can put TLS on top of our TCP/IP connections.</p>
<p>If you recall from a <a href="https://blog.drogue.io/wifi-offload/">previous blogpost</a>, we have created a TCP stack based on using an ESP8266 over our USART. 
We're still doing that. 
But now we'll initialize the TLS platform and wrap it around that network stack to give us a secure network stack.</p>
<p>First, we initialize, providing a 48kb blob of memory for the heap-ish allocation.
We also set up a (terrible) entropy source (this needs to be improved) and see the random-number-generator (RNG):</p>
<pre><code><span>let mut</span><span> ssl_platform = SslPlatform::setup(
    cortex_m_rt::heap_start() as </span><span>usize</span><span>,
    </span><span>1024 </span><span>* </span><span>48</span><span>).</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();

ssl_platform.</span><span>entropy_context_mut</span><span>().</span><span>add_source</span><span>(StaticEntropySource);

ssl_platform.</span><span>seed_rng</span><span>().</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once our previously-described underlying network stack is fired up and ready to rock, we can borrow it and build ourselves a secure network stack:</p>
<pre><code><span>let mut</span><span> ssl_config = ssl_platform.</span><span>new_client_config</span><span>(Transport::Stream, Preset::Default).</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
ssl_config.</span><span>authmode</span><span>(Verify::None);

</span><span>// consume the config, take a non-mutable ref to the network.
</span><span>let</span><span> secure_network = SslTcpStack::new(ssl_config, &amp;network);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note, we haven't enabled verification of authentication on the far end. Normally we would have some root Certificate Authority (CA) keys set up and ensure the far end of the …</p></article></div>

    <p>TL;DR - Your first marketing hire should probably be a director-level person who can be made accountable for generating a sales pipelines, with experience at a company 2-5x your size.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this article you’ll learn to hire a great first marketer for your startup. It’s based on all the good and bad first marketing hires I’ve witnessed at over a dozen enterprise software startups. (Surrounded by some of my cartoons, for added flavor.)</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/486438bbf79aa71853fb177b255c63e0923cfa97/a8afd/images/uploads/428.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a high-energy employee"></p>

<p>I wrote this guide because I often get asked by founders of B2B software startups for advice on hiring their first marketer. It’s not an easy task, because all marketers look the same to a technical founder, and the stakes are high, with pressure to get customers, increase revenue, and demonstrate an ability to grow both of those at a predictable and nonlinear rate.</p>

<p>What’s covered:</p>

  <li><a href="#criteria">Key Criteria</a></li>
  <li><a href="#seniority">Seniority and the Strategy-Tactics Spectrum</a></li>
  <li><a href="#derisk">De-risking</a></li>
</ol>

<hr>


<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the goals of a first marketing hire:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pipeline</strong> - Assuming you’re past product-market-fit by the time you set out to hire your first marketer (recommended), the next most important thing becomes acquiring customers and gaining a foothold in the market.</li>
  <li><strong>Explore</strong> - Learn what strategies and tactics are effective for acquiring customers, and which ones aren’t. This will help allocate future resources with greater confidence and higher return, and is the first step to building a scalable process (flywheel).</li>
  <li><strong>Lay the foundation</strong> - Ensure the basics are in place: Messaging, a website that attracts and converts visitors into sales leads, basic funnel and attribution analytics, building a contact list, and so on. This will accelerate ramp-up and multiply the effect of future marketing projects and hires.</li>
  <li><strong>Free your time</strong> - Marketing is just another thing that takes up time you’d rather spend on the product, closing deals, supporting customers, and growing the company. A successful first marketing hire would free you to focus on those things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those goals help shape the criteria and seniority of your ideal first marketing hire.</p>


<h2 id="key-criteria">Key Criteria</h2>

<p>Unless you have another reason to believe the person will be successful in their role—such as a trusted recommendation, or you know the person well—then your first marketing hire <em>must</em> meet the following three criteria:</p>

<h3 id="1-growth-ownership">1. Growth Ownership</h3>

<p>The person must be capable and willing to be held accountable for growth of the company, as measured by concrete metrics such as growth rate and revenue (CMO/VP), or sales pipeline quality and volume (manager/director).</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting you tie compensation to these metrics; only that you make them a key responsibility and screening criteria for the role.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61eb908c619ba3a7b75823c799f72e29260102b3/03448/images/uploads/432.jpg" alt="Cartoon about talent"></p>

<p>Reporting on these metrics is not the same as affecting them. Anyone can plug in Google Analytics or generate a Salesforce report to see lead quantities and ARR, but not everyone is capable of <em>doubling</em> those metrics or willing to be held accountable for it. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Marketers from large companies are insulated from growth metrics by the management layers above them. Their performance was measured by the amount of work completed, by their <em>department’s</em> performance, by distant downstream metrics (such as site traffic, blog readership, or search keyword rankings), or even by how their boss <em>thinks</em> they’re doing. To early stage startups these are vanity metrics; they look great but don’t make a meaningful difference.</p>

<p>Marketers from sales-centric companies might see their primary role as supporting the sales team and accelerating the sales cycle. They measure their performance by metrics such as the number of collateral materials they produce (eg, whitepapers, case studies) and consider it the sales department’s responsibility to close deals and grow revenue. This won’t fly at a startup where the length of sales cycles is a second-order concern.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3527c9add26a07d9681a07e54f8c570536c03256/f35d8/images/uploads/447.jpg" alt="Cartoon about social media marketing"></p>

<p>Marketers with a more traditional background view their mission as increasing awareness in the market and conveying the “right” message. They prioritize activities such as branding, communication, tradeshows, website designs, and social media. The value traditional marketers can add to an early stage software startup as a <em>first hire</em> is close to zero, regardless of their seniority. Communications and branding will help scale reach, but only after you have a decent customer base.</p>

<!--End mc_embed_signup-->
<hr>

<p>Lastly, some marketers want to join a startup for reasons other than taking on growth responsibility. For example, they might just want to get in on the ground floor, to experience the startup life, to have more freedom, or to work on a greater variety of projects. These people are neither prepared not expecting to take accountability for growth of the company.</p>

<p>Marketers with demand-generation experience (ie, demand-gen marketers) are good candidates because they’re used to having responsibility for pipeline metrics and they know some strategies and tactics to try.</p>

<h4 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to tie marketing projects to business objectives.</li>
  <li>Ownership of growth-related metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="interview-questions">Interview Questions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What metrics are you responsible for at your current position?</li>
  <li>Tell me about one of your projects that made a big impact on growth?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-ability-to-execute">2. Ability to Execute</h3>

<p>At this stage of the startup there isn’t much value in making long-term marketing plans, nor is there enough data to make good plans. Therefore, the first marketing hire must be able to create rough plans, execute them, and then iterate. That requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bias for <em>action</em> over meticulous planning.</li>
  <li>Skills (or interest in learning) to run many different types of marketing campaigns.</li>
  <li>Experimental and analytical approach to marketing campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of my clients hired a head of marketing who spent their first three months crafting a 12-month marketing plan instead of actually <em>doing</em> anything. That’s three months of missed experiments, learning, and iterating. It also suggests they didn’t plan on learning anything then or in the next year that might alter the course. Months later the CEO saw behind the smokescreen, but it was a costly mistake that could have been avoided if the candidate was screened for ability to execute.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/75a77fbc5a934252260152f0ecc4ee313e0061ce/2751f/images/uploads/436.jpg" alt="Cartoon about poor performance"></p>

<p>One indicator that a person can execute is if their current/previous company is 2-5x the size of yours, either in headcount or revenue. You want somebody who’s been where you’re headed. They remember what the journey looks like and have an idea of how to repeat it, they’re accustomed to wearing multiple hats, and they can make do with slightly smaller budgets. If the gap is any larger than that—for example, if you’re considering a marketer from a post-IPO company for your $2m ARR startup—then they might turn out powerless without the resources and management structures they’re used to.</p>

<p>Some marketers, unfortunately, tout their experience running different campaigns when they really mean they have experience being an intermediary between their company and a <em>marketing agency</em> that ran those campaigns. You don’t want to realize too late that the marketing hire thought they’d have help from an agency when you didn’t plan or budget for that.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to hire a CMO or VP (more on that below) for their vision and direction and <em>not</em> for their hands-on abilities, they must still be able to execute in terms of building out an exceptional marketing team with the resources and runway available.</p>

<h4 id="qualifications-1">Qualifications</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Experience executing marketing campaigns at a company with X-Y employees/revenue.</li>
  <li>Ability to plan, execute, and iterate marketing campaigns at a rapid pace.</li>
  <li>Experimental and analytical approach to marketing campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="interview-questions-1">Interview Questions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What would you want to accomplish in the first 90 days, and how?</li>
  <li>Tell me about a campaign you took from idea to completion?</li>
  <li>Tell me about a campaign that failed, and what did you do?</li>
  <li>What resources would you need to be successful?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-domain-knowledge">3. Domain Knowledge</h3>

<p>It’s important to have a marketer experienced with the domain you’re in, such as B2B, B2C, enterprise software, SaaS for SMB, consumer app, online media, etc. Enterprise buyers, mid-size companies, startups, SMBs, professionals, and consumers all make purchase decisions in different ways, so marketing tactics and strategies don’t always translate well between these markets. What works for a consumer-app startup might not work for an enterprise-software startup that has six-month sales cycles; what works for that enterprise software startup won’t work for an SMB SaaS that has lower customer lifetime values and therefore can’t survive with high acquisition costs.</p>

<p>You should also choose a marketer who can grok <em>or demonstrates the ability</em> to grok your product and target audience. They don’t need to know the product and audience inside-out on day one, but they should have a basic understanding right away and be able to gain a deep understanding within three months. Finding such a person is tough if your product is complex (eg, enterprise software) and your audience is marketing-averse (eg, engineers), but it’s <em>critical</em> if you want (and you do) to choose a first marketer who adds value instead of just being a coordinator or a people-person.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d953a1bddd10f27a9975fd5835f15495d53dc8be/f62bf/images/uploads/people-skills.gif" alt="First marketing hire shouldn't just be a people-person."></p>

<h4 id="qualifications-2">Qualifications</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Experience driving growth in [B2B/B2C/SMB/…] markets.</li>
  <li>Domain knowledge of [industry/product/audience] space.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="interview-questions-2">Interview Questions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What’s your interest in the [industry] space?</li>
  <li>What company in the [industry] space do you think is doing marketing well, and why?</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="seniority-and-the-strategy-tactics-spectrum">Seniority and the Strategy-Tactics Spectrum</h2>

<p>Everyone says they can roll up their sleeves and do work. Not everyone can figure out the right work to do.</p>

<p>How do you ensure your first marketing hire does the right work to maximize growth? Do you start with a CMO, VP, director, manager, or specialist? The answer to both is finding someone balanced in strategic and tactical thinking.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Exciting new enhancements in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-in-elastic-7-9-0-free-workplace-search-engine-endpoint-security">7.9 release</a> of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search">Elastic Enterprise Search</a> make it easier than ever for you to offer powerful, modern search experiences for your app users, workplace teammates, and website visitors. Elastic Workplace Search features added to our free distribution tier provide you with a powerful starting point for empowering your teams with relevant information, even in the face of tightening budgets.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt262c603406aea4fd/5f3555d348d3b57cb974a5b8/enterprise-search-7-9-ws-thumbnails-blog.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="blt262c603406aea4fd" alt="Elastic Workplace Search results screen with thumbnail preview"></p><p>Our 7.9 release continues to build on our recent efforts during a hectic 2020 to make Elastic Enterprise Search  available wherever you are, whether that’s via Elastic Cloud on Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regions-templates-instances.html">dozens of regions</a> around the world, or with the self-managed download. Other new developments include Gmail content source integrations in Workplace Search, the introduction of Elastic Enterprise Search into Kibana, improvements in index management and logging, and intuitive UI updates. Let’s dive into a few of the details.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Features of Workplace Search added to our free distribution tier</h2></strong></p><p>
	The addition of Workplace Search features to our free distribution tier means that you can <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise-search">download</a> and use the entire Elastic Enterprise Search solution to easily get started and boost productivity with modern search experiences. Whether it’s App Search for your apps and websites or Workplace Search for your internal teams, with the features included in the free distribution tier&nbsp;you can download and evaluate our full product suite. Workplace Search includes connectors to a host of popular collaboration, storage, and productivity tools, along with access to the Custom Source API for creating your own connectors. You also get group and user management tools, easily tunable content source prioritization by team, and much more. Then, as you need additional customization, integrations, granular access control, and single-sign-on (SSO) support, you’ll find it all in our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions">Platinum subscription</a>.
</p><h2><strong>Introducing Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana</strong></h2><p>In 7.9, Kibana rolls out the welcome mat to Elastic Enterprise Search, offering easy navigation to your search deployments right alongside all your other favorite analysis and visualization tools. As the window into the Elastic Stack, Kibana allows users to do everything from rich data visualization using Elasticsearch indices to administering and managing the whole of the Elastic Stack. With this release, Kibana admins can customize spaces to show or hide Enterprise Search in the main navigation menu, and give users the capability to quickly access deployments and in-app dashboards.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd64ad0cc9a899866/5f3599c5327a6201d7ebba32/enterprise-search-7-9-in-kibana-blog.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltd64ad0cc9a899866" alt="Elastic Enterprise Search in Kibana"></p><p><strong><h2>Announcing the federated Gmail connector for Workplace Search</h2></strong></p><p>Gmail joins Google Drive, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Confluence, and a number of other <a href="https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search/content-sources">prebuilt content source integrations</a> for Workplace Search. Google is obviously no slouch at search, of course, but Workplace Search offers a single search bar for not just the G Suite, but across a slew of sources, regardless of the origin, manufacturer, or ecosystem. Users can conduct search without needing to remember where that data lives, and they’ll see their own private <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/7.9/workplace-search-gmail-connector.html">Gmail content</a> right alongside all those other sources, with pretuned search relevance baked right in.&nbsp;
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb8b3fc0b19a40778/5f3556811fe0e07eae8141bc/enterprise-search-7-9-gmail-connector-blog.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltb8b3fc0b19a40778" alt="Gmail content source integration in Elastic Workplace Search "></p><p><strong><h2>Gleaning new insights from your knowledge landscape</h2></strong></p><p>Workplace Search tracks and logs document and record activity as it unfolds on third-party systems synchronized to the search experience, providing a centralized location for keeping track of organizational information shifts and hot spots. Over time, this provides businesses with critical insight into user behavior in third-party systems as well as auditing capabilities for information security purposes that often are not otherwise available. Combining this functionality with the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security">Elastic Security</a> solution and our machine learning capabilities introduces a new and unique value for system administrators and IT teams.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Gaining more control over scale</h2></strong></p><p>Because Elastic Enterprise Search is built atop the Elastic Stack, powerful features can be pulled into App Search and Workplace Search based on user needs. In 7.9, App Search and Workplace Search inherit the index lifecycle management (ILM) policies feature from the Elastic Stack to automatically manage logs and analytics.
</p><p>The logs and analytics for Elastic Enterprise Search are now cycled automatically with ILM. Users can also change how long logs and analytics are retained with existing Elastic Stack tools, like the Kibana ILM policy management tool.&nbsp;
</p> <p><strong><h2>What else?</h2></strong></p><p>There are a few other Workplace Search updates in 7.9. You can use OpenSearch to quickly add a shortcut to your browser’s search bar to jump right to Workplace Search. There’s no need for tab switching just to conduct a quick search.
</p><p>Workplace Search also sports new document thumbnail previews, giving you snappy visual cues with robust document excerpts and metadata, for quickly finding just what you need.
</p><p>And rounding out the update are more personalized search results based on user behavior. The Search API inside Workplace Search now supports auto-filter detection as well as query-time boosting. This means authenticated user context on a page can be provided in the Search API to deliver a more customized search experience.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Try it today!</h2></strong>There’s a lot to like in 7.9, and we hope you’re as excited to try it as we are to introduce it. Existing Elastic Cloud customers can access Enterprise Search directly from the <a href="http://cloud.elastic.co/">Elastic Cloud console</a>. New to the Elastic Cloud? Start a <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/registration">free 14-day trial of Elastic Enterprise Search</a>. Or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise-search">download</a> the self-managed versions of App Search or Workplace Search for free.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

It doesn’t matter where you’re coming from (Codegiant, Hacker News, Reddit, or some other place), I always appreciate every reader who lands on my articles.</em></p><p id="0d0f">Now that I’ve coaxed you into reading this article, let’s get down to brass tacks.</p><p id="fb09">Whenever you’re just starting out with <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb">software development</a> or simply want to uplevel your programming skills, you’ll need the right info resources to achieve your goals.</p><p id="3284">In this article, I’ve listed 22 of the best YouTube channels for improving your programming skills. Some are geared towards beginners while others focus on advanced topics.</p><p id="993e">So, if you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you can jump over to the last section where you’ll find all the 22 YouTube channels.</p><p id="2c67">If you are a beginner developer, however, I recommend that you go through each section of this article as we’ll talk about coding in general, programming skills, your computer programming resume, job opportunities, and some of the most in-demand programming languages.</p><p id="65e3">Without further ado:</p><p id="359c">Coding is the end result of a specific set of actions triggered to create a tangible result, whether it is a web page, an app, a video, or just an image on your screen.</p><p id="c92e">The great thing about computer coding (or programming) is that you can have a big idea and actually code it out into reality. And it doesn’t cost much, barring some time and effort on your side.</p><p id="3e5a">Many non-tech people consider the definition of a computer programmer to be someone who just makes programs. Although that’s partly true, partly not, it’s a mistake. Managers believe that the more lines of code a programmer can produce a month, the more creative he will be — another mistake. You can’t put a <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-developer-vs-software-engineer-31e873e787bc">developer</a> into a cubicle, set a deadline, ask him to work for 8–9 hours straight, and expect a top-notch quality software at the end.</p><p id="9e66">Instead of thinking about the programs a developer composes, one should consider the possible computations evoked by the developed program. “Designing a set of computations” is a more accurate description of what programmers actually do.</p><p id="5647">One can also imagine programmers as writers that have to think and write carefully, because the readers (the computers) take what the programmers write literally.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2330/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi" width="1165" height="805" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="f506">Many non-tech folks believe that programming is all about acquiring technical skills. I believe that being a developer requires more than just knowing how to code. To make it in the software development world, you’ll need to dig up some creativity and inject it into your coding skills. The ability to think analytically is highly valued among developers as well.</p><p id="1779">One of the most essential skills a developer can have isn’t actually technical, it’s social, and that is empathy. Lack of empathy inevitably leads to poor communication (barring you are a narcissist, sociopath, or psychopath and therefore can be charming as hell). On the other hand, being able to put empathy into practice will, without doubt, boost your career opportunities.</p><p id="9732">When it comes to <strong>planning software</strong>, developers should know how to use models and flowcharts to convey instructions clearly.</p><p id="c39f"><strong>Designing and creating applications</strong>. Depending on the project, this can take from a couple of weeks to months and sometimes even years to complete.</p><p id="9b77"><strong>Writing programs</strong>. As simple as that.</p><p id="9220"><strong>Update and expand existing programs</strong>. Most times, you’ll need to modify and update existing programs with extra features.</p><p id="e7df"><strong>Debugging code</strong>. Yup.</p><p id="5ef0"><strong>Simplify programming</strong>. Developers may also use software tools to automate a part of their development process in order to simplify and speed up the workflow.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2564/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS" width="1282" height="869" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*tJ40Go85DKYBw5cS?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8ced">Showing up and practicing your programming skills seem to be the main ingredients to getting better at programming and coding. You gotta be programming in your spare time; you gotta be obsessed with it. Load yourself with patience because becoming a skilled coder takes years. And anyone who is telling you that you can learn and become good at coding in a month is probably trying to sell you something.</p><p id="8e25">Senior developers have all adopted common traits and basic coding skills that have helped them to rise in the hierarchy during their programming careers. Here are some valuable skills needed for you to be a senior developer:</p><p id="3a2c">One, being able to easily explain tech stuff to non-technical people.</p><p id="b60e">Two, being able to come up with accurate estimates.</p><p id="8cdb">Three, willingness to roll up their sleeves and do some grunt work.</p><p id="49a8">Four, knowing when to raise an issue to upper management.</p><p id="ff3f">Five, the ability to mentor junior developers.</p><p id="eb41">Six, vast knowledge of the technicalities for their domain.</p><h2 id="5ec1">Understand how the language works</h2><p id="e035">Focus on one language while learning. Having your focus split between two or three languages will discombobulate you.</p><p id="c797">It becomes obvious when a programmer doesn’t have a good understanding of the programming language he’s using. He’ll try to solve problems by following the logic of other languages and thus litter the code with unnecessary statements that can otherwise be reduced to fewer lines.</p><p id="094c">Also, you must know how to organize code into a system that makes sense. Creating rigid classes, schemas, and hierarchies require you to first think them through. Design can be a broad topic so I won’t cover much, but if you wish to read more, head over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="e256">Poorly designed software lacks well-defined concepts, and its responsibilities are vague. Good software, on the other hand, comes with clear concepts and responsibilities. Take a look at mathematicians and physicists. They spend a huge amount of time trying to develop a clear definition of something because that will allow them to understand the truth about it. Developers should take a similar approach and spend a considerable amount of time brainstorming before writing code. Yes, this might be controversial to Agile but you gotta do what you gotta do.</p><p id="8ecf">It’s better to sit down with the dev team initially and outline all the required tasks than to go through 10 rounds of code reviews later.</p><p id="ea9f">Perhaps the best way to learn about design is to write and study many programs written by experienced programmers. As you gain more coding experience, you’ll, without doubt, enhance your design skills and expand your knowledge.</p><p id="0729">Good programmers ask questions like:</p><ul><li id="ff87">What’s the goal of this function?</li><li id="ee63">How can I explain this data structure to my teammates?</li><li id="771f">Can this function represent two standalone tasks?</li><li id="0e31">What’s the responsibility of this snippet of code?</li><li id="0f32">What should I include in the public interface?</li></ul><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2648/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt" width="1324" height="919" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="d2d4">Most people think that you need a diploma from Harvard or universities alike to be considered for a job in big tech companies. Although that may be partially true (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" rel="noopener">not always though, it seems Apple and Google no longer require you to have a college degree</a>), some companies prefer the opposite, or at least don’t want you to be coming for Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, etc.</p><p id="3c6c">There are CEOs out there looking for developers that are qualified but not overly qualified… hard workers, being on time, but also leaving at the stroke of 5. Such CEOs consider Ivy League schools to be a red flag. Big resumes are also a red flag. That’s because developers coming from such schools can’t get off their high horse, question whether every decision is optimal, and are always hungry for praise, recognition, and “interesting work.”</p><p id="c97a">Instead, these CEOs are looking for loyal people who know how to take orders without questioning, and are ready to do the work, day in and day out, because they need the paycheck at the end of the month.</p><p id="6749">At a glance, this might seem quite controversial. Yet, there are developers out there who don’t want to become millionaire CTOs at the age of 30. Instead, they are satisfied with what they have on their plate: a steady job, fair pay, and that’s about it. Some companies with that kind of culture say that they have produced a 100% employee retention rate which means developers are happy with their work environment.</p><h2 id="11a4">Let’s talk about your resume now.</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1964/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK" width="982" height="911" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2aa7">So, what should you list on your resume?</p><p id="8bab">Proficiency in programming languages is, ostensibly, a vital thing to include. Always remember that companies are getting tens, hundreds, even thousands of applications a month. All of which say “I can do X.” The thing is skill level varies between each applicant. You should describe your coding experience and give examples of successful projects you’ve completed.</p><p id="dbb6">When listing your most valuable programming skills, there are a couple of things you need to know in order to have a fully optimized programming resume.</p><ol><li id="72b7">Before sending your resume, always go through the job description a couple of times and try to understand what is relevant to the job you are applying for. Then make yourself relevant to the job.</li><li id="dd11">Always be honest with yourself. Don’t list programming languages you don’t know because they are mentioned in the job description. Don’t tell them you have 5 years of experience when you only have 4 years and 1 month.</li><li id="1642">Place your programming skills (languages) right at the top, below the header.</li><li id="a384">List your most advanced coding skills first, then in the middle list the ones you are least experienced with, and at the end, list the programming skills you have a decent experience with.</li><li id="44ae">Create horizontal categories instead of vertical ones. This eliminates the blank space on your resume while remaining aesthetically pleasing.</li></ol><p id="1230">In your resume, except for talking about what you bring to the table, you can also mention what you’re looking for in an employer. You’ll thus earn the respect you are looking for if you get the job.</p><p id="48b7">Also, avoid using phrases that everybody else is using. Don’t be afraid to infuse your CV with some personality. You’ll thus stand out. Not everybody will like your personality, but those that do will adore you. Try to be specific in your writing. Instead of “extensive experience,” say “5 years and 6 months of experience.” Instead of saying “Y number of successful projects,” say “Y amount of successful projects that helped us achieve A, …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

September 25, 2020 | https://www.cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I read a <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">Why Not Rust?</a> article the other day that was quite good but dismissed the most important reason to use a language to me: <strong>security</strong>. After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and security, yet I still have some pain points that will make me recommend <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> over Rust sometimes. Keep in mind that I have also spent my whole career looking for bugs in applications written in dozens of different languages, so my post might be highly controversial but it has to be looked from these lenses.</p>
<h2>Shallow standard library</h2>
<p>Working with Rust is like working with Javascript in many ways. While the package manager Cargo is truly awesome, the fact that the standard library misses most features will have you import many third-party dependencies. These dependencies in turn import other third-party dependencies, that import other third-party dependencies, and so on. This blow up of dependencies can quickly become a nightmare, and this is of course a perfect vector of attack for backdoors, like we've seen happen before in javascript land (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor">https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor</a>/, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds</a>/).</p>
<p>Not only this, but if you're a newcomer to Rust, how do you even pick the right library? I can't even fathom how anyone writing a project in Rust gets to pick a good library for generating cryptographic random numbers, or for doing any type of crypto like encrypting or hashing, or for decoding hex strings, or for decoding JSON, or for using TCP, or even for using TLS! On the other hand Golang has all of that in its standard library, that means that when you use Golang you:</p>
<ul>
<li>can't pick the wrong algorithm (e.g. DES instead of AES)</li>
<li>can't pick a bad implementation (the standard library is known to be high quality) </li>
<li>can't pick a dependency that ends up importing plenty of other third-party dependencies (unlike Rust, the Golang standard library never imports third-party libraries)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about version updates (you're just updating your version of Golang instead of the versions of many dependencies)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about transitive dependencies that you can't update (again, Golang standard library doesn't rely on third-party dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="http://libra.org/">Libra</a> we've used a number of techniques in order to reduce the number of third-party dependencies we use. This included figuring out when we used different dependencies that did the same thing, or figuring out what obscure dependencies we should avoid, we even re-wrote a large number of dependencies to avoid dependencies that ended up exploding the number of transitive third-party dependencies we imported. One useful tool we used for some of that is <a href="https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell">dephell</a> which is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy">guppy</a>.</p>
<h2>Rustfmt is imperfect</h2>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is great, but <code>rustfmt</code> sucks. Why does it suck? Two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>it's not mandatory</li>
<li>it's configurable</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Golang's compiler is very strict and will yell at you early on if you have dead code, unused dependencies, badly formatted code, and so on. It doesn't replace <code>gofmt</code>, but it's much more opinionated and is much more effective at making Golang's codebases more readable (especially if they forget to run <code>gofmt</code>). In addition, if you do use <code>gofmt</code>, you can't configure it! This is very apparent when you read Golang code, it always looks the same! And it is pretty fucking fantastic if you ask me, because not only Golang is easy to learn, but you can quickly get used to any Golang codebase due to the consistent formatting of the language.</p>
<h2>Too many ways to do things</h2>
<p>Rust has a somewhat different syntax from other languages of its genre, and you sometimes see things that you might not be used to see (statement as expression, match statements, lifetimes, etc.) I couldn't care less about these, these are things you can learn, and you end up getting used to them. What I can't get used to is the sheer number of ways to do something. There are so many keywords in Rust, and there's so many ways to end up bike shedding on the best way to write the exact same statement, that I consider it a waste of time. It's a waste of time for the developers, but also for the reviewers who will often run into keywords that they've never seen before. For example, there are too many ways to panic on purpose: <code>panic!()</code>, <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>except()</code>, <code>unreachable!()</code>, <code>todo!()</code>, <code>unimplemented!()</code>, <code>assert!()</code>, and so on. </p>
<h2>Generics and macros</h2>
<p>Rust is too expressive. This is of course great for some use-cases, but holy shit if a developer wants to be too clever, they can create the most unintelligible codebase that you'll ever seen. This is probably the most controversial point, but security is not just safety, it's also readability. As we say "complexity is the enemy of security", and generics undeniably add complexity. This is of course up to the developers to abuse them, but the great thing about Golang is that there aren't many things to abuse, codebases are often straight forward and you can quickly understand what is happening.</p>
<h2>Ok, you're being unreasonable David</h2>
<p>Sure, I'm omitting a lot of good Rust things in here, but this is a post about the security downsides of Rust, not the upsides, which let's be clear still make Rust the perfect language to write a sensitive application in. You just need to know what you're doing. This also means that Rust has a lot of room to mature, while generics are here to stay, there is no excuse to keep slipping the shallow stdlib under the rug.</p>

The nations of Europe had spent the past century or two fighting very hard to keep anything much from <em>happening</em>. In the 1500s (ish), Spain had been the dominant power on the continent, fueled by the great wealth it stole from the Americas. Most of Europe formed a shaky alliance to beat up on Spain before Spain could beat up on them individually. Now in the 1600s, France was the dominant power. Most of Europe joined a series of pacts and leagues to attack France for the same reason. </p><p id="viewer-4724o">This was ‘balance of power’ politics. Driven by a desire not to be conquered, most nations worked together to keep the most powerful among them contained. The result was decades of war, millions dead, and only a few minor territories changing hands here or there. Despite the oh-so-complicated webs of alliances, the endless betrayals, and the absolute meat grinder the peasantry had to endure, at the end of each war of containment, little of consequence ever changed.</p><p id="viewer-3tjba">The impending death of King Carlos II of Spain was one more threat to the balance of power. Carlos had no heir. His closest living relatives weren’t Spaniards. It seemed likely that, upon his death, control of Spain would pass to the ruling house of a different European nation. That nation would gain not just Spain, but also the Netherlands, most of America, much of Italy, and the Philippines. Bolstered by this newfound revenue, this nation might then be strong enough to take on all of Europe and win. So out came the diplomats. Their goal: to convince enough other nations that <em>their</em> royal family should inherit the Spanish throne.</p><div id="viewer-26ea5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.moltensulfur.com/post/carving-up-spain" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_40be39e7d1a14d4a9c64c0645dc7c47c~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_409,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_40be39e7d1a14d4a9c64c0645dc7c47c~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-7hc14">King Carlos II of Spain</p><p id="viewer-5a648">We have three major players here. The first is King Carlos II of Spain. Carlos was born sick and lived his whole life sick. In English, he was called Charles the Sufferer. In Spanish, he was Carlos <em>el Hechizado</em> (‘the Bewitched’). Over his life, he suffered from what surely felt like every infection and congenital disease known to his doctors. The most obvious was his pronounced ‘lantern jaw’, which made eating and speaking difficult. It’s also possible he suffered from intellectual developmental disabilities. From the moment of his birth as his parents’ sole heir, his death was anticipated at any moment by the courts of Europe. That he made it to age 38 is a miracle.

</p><p id="viewer-6rtsi">Carlos was of the House of Habsburg, a German noble family that had an astonishing run of good fortune with marriage alliances in the late 1400s. Habsburgs kept marrying into royal families, conceiving heirs, and then having all the necessary members of these royal families die, leaving a Habsburg the sole heir. This truly incredible run of luck culminated in Carlos’ great-great-grandfather being simultaneously the Holy Roman Emperor; King of Castille, Aragon, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and Hungary; Archduke of Austria; Lord of the Netherlands; and more besides –&nbsp;all nominally separate countries (more or less) who just happened to have the same king. After that guy, the Habsburgs were pressured into splitting their family into two branches. One would rule Spain (and its holdings), the other Austria (and its holdings).</p><p id="viewer-268fb">Carlos’ medical conditions were the result of the Habsburgs’ notorious inbreeding. More than anyone, the Habsburgs knew that what they’d gained by marriage, they could lose by marriage. The Austrian and Spanish Habsburg branches intermarried constantly. All eight of Carlos II’s great-grandparents shared a recent ancestor. This all led not only to Carlos’ sickliness, but also to his impotence, which guaranteed he could not produce an heir.</p><div id="viewer-8sbcl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.moltensulfur.com/post/carving-up-spain" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_09017a246c2f48739d0a6f9075f65762~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_946,h_553,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_09017a246c2f48739d0a6f9075f65762~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ch9qf">Emperor Leopold I of Austria</p><p id="viewer-d35m6">Carlos’ counterpart, the head of the Austrian branch of the family, was Leopold I. Leopold was a remarkable man. He spoke five languages, composed music, and cared deeply about statecraft. He was also a mild-mannered vacillator and a fanatical Catholic. Like Carlos, Leopold was absurdly inbred. His jaw stuck out so far, he couldn’t keep water out of his mouth when it rained. Leopold I sat atop a jumbled-together collection of kingdoms, duchies, and principalities, including Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, Styria, Moravia, Tyrol, and Croatia. He was also the Holy Roman Emperor, but that title came with little power and few responsibilities.

</p><p id="viewer-5m6jb">As a Habsburg, Leopold had an excellent male-line claim to the Spanish throne. This was handy, since not all of Carlos II’s Spanish empire recognized that rulership could be passed down the female line. But in case that wasn’t enough, Leopold was also married to Carlos’ sister, Margarita Theresa. He was supposed to marry Margarita Theresa’s older sister, Marie Theresa, but Marie had to be married off at the last minute to King Louis XIV of France after Spain lost a war with France in 1659. Carlos and Leopold hastily arranged for Leopold to marry the younger Margarita Theresa instead, but that had to wait awhile, as Margarita Theresa was only nine at the time.</p><div id="viewer-4n1g"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.moltensulfur.com/post/carving-up-spain" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_d86f76d044e94c25a739badb21778cdf~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_409,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_d86f76d044e94c25a739badb21778cdf~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6tsic">King Louis XIV of France</p><p id="viewer-e5hu0">And this is where we introduce the other major claimant to the Spanish throne: France. King Louis XIV’s wife was the oldest sister of King Carlos II, giving Louis and Marie Theresa’s oldest son, the <em>Grande Dauphin</em>, an excellent claim to the throne of Spain. When Louis XIV died, that would make the <em>Grande Dauphin</em> king of France and Spain simultaneously. Admittedly, part of Louis XIV and Marie Theresa’s marriage contract was a promise that Marie Theresa renounce any claim on Spanish inheritance, but that promise was predicated on Spain paying France a sum it could not afford and never paid. Furthermore, this was an era where monarchs were believed to have been appointed by God. <em>Could</em> royalty renounce their inheritance? It was unclear.

</p><p id="viewer-eh5fb">It’s difficult to talk about Louis XIV as a person (in other words, as an NPC) instead of merely as a ruler, because so much of who he was as a person was bound up in <em>being</em> an absolute monarch. His famous quip “I <em>am</em> the state” kind of sums it up. On top of that, he was a womanizer and a grand patron of the arts. Like Leopold I, he was a fanatical Catholic, but he wasn’t a strict <em>Roman</em> Catholic. He was a devout Gallican, a long-running strain of Catholicism that holds that there’s something special about the French church, and that it should be permitted to operate free of interference from Rome.

</p><div id="viewer-70q57"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.moltensulfur.com/post/carving-up-spain" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_a9bf8649680142a0a4d0b7d690b7244a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_399,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_a9bf8649680142a0a4d0b7d690b7244a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5tgm1">So we’ve got the major players assembled. Leopold I had a claim on the Spanish throne down the male line and via his wife. Louis XIV had a superior claim (or his son did) via the female line, though it was somewhat tainted by Marie Theresa’s renunciation of her inheritance. How did this dispute get resolved?</p><p id="viewer-s1f8">First, there was an attempt at a compromise candidate. Leopold I and Margarita Theresa had a daughter, who had married the Elector of Bavaria and had a son by him, named Joseph Ferdinand. If that son became the King of Spain, it wouldn’t upset the balance of power; no one cared if Spain and Bavaria were held by the same man. Louis XIV and Leopold I both signed a treaty (the First Partition Treaty) that agreed young Joseph Ferdinand would inherit Spain. In exchange, some Spanish territory in Italy and the Pyrenees would be carved off and given to France and Austria. But Joseph Ferdinand died at age 6, only four months after the First Partition Treaty was signed, so that deal went kaput.</p><p id="viewer-7kd4l">France then met with England behind closed doors to get England’s sign-off on a Second Partition Treaty. This would give most of the Spanish Empire to Leopold’s son Karl and give Spain’s possessions in Italy to France. England signed the treaty, but Leopold did not. He saw Italy as a vulnerable flank France could use to invade Austria. He was willing to pass up a deal that granted him America, the Netherlands, and the Philippines in order to claim Italy.</p><p id="viewer-7gdo4">Carlos (and Spain more broadly) didn’t like any of this. They didn’t want to see Spain’s empire broken up. On September 29th, 1700, Carlos (now sicker than ever) signed a will written by his pro-Habsburg wife. The will designated Leopold’s son (and Carlos’ nephew) Karl the heir to the empire of Spain. Some of Carlos’ ministers disagreed. They saw France –&nbsp;at the time Europe’s greatest military power –&nbsp;as the only nation that could save Spain from being broken apart. They wore down the dying Carlos and on October 30th, convinced him to sign a new will naming Louis XIV’s grandson as his heir. Carlos II died two days later.</p><p id="viewer-2ffal">Of course, no one outside France or Spain wanted to see the two nations joined. Under international pressure, Louis XIV offered to ignore Carlos’ will and abide by the Second Partition Treaty. Leopold, looking once again at Italy, refused. A Grand Alliance formed to oppose and contain France, and the War of the Spanish Succession raged for thirteen years. Naturally, the war ended in much the same place it began. The other nations of Europe acknowledged Louis XIV’s grandson as the King of Spain, but France and Spain remained separate and the same man was never king of both.</p><div id="viewer-8piad"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.moltensulfur.com/post/carving-up-spain" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_8878d4ff487b4be696d8e0c96b9cc91d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1280,h_749,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/82a6d0_8878d4ff487b4be696d8e0c96b9cc91d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-86l34">In real life, the diplomats failed to find a solution to the crisis of the Spanish Succession.

				<p>Either you love gorgeous typography or just don’t care. If you are the former read ahead on how to make the font rendering on your Linux look just as awesome as that on macOS, else read on to find out what beauty you have been missing.</p>
<p>I switched to a hackintosh for a while and fell in love with how beautiful the typography was. After returning to Linux and some fiddiling around I came across a not so ugly setup that looked close enough to macOS. So if you want to make your Linux Distro a tad bit typographically better, follow along.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>This is how the fonts look on the default installation of Manjaro Linux.

<h3 id="some-pointers">Some Pointers</h3>
<p>Rather than copy pasting everything on here, let’s try to understand why the fonts on macOS looks better than the ones we have on Linux.</p>
<p>Fonts belong to certain types.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> : Well the sans fonts on your computer. The regular plain fonts.</li>
<li><code>serif</code> : The fonts that look like they came out of a 14th century Bible. You know with the curves and they look like showoffs.</li>
<li><code>monospace</code> : The typical code font. The ones where every character is the same width.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason fonts look way better on macOS is because Steve Jobs loved typography, and he went the extra mile and licensed some great typefaces for each font type, and recently Apple put in the extra effort to make their custom fonts even better. Well fret not Linux has some free fonts that are metric compatible(means they look awfully similar), and better that we can substitute for fonts.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Step one is installing the fonts that look similar or better than the ones on macOS.
All the fonts that are used here can be found on the Arch Repositories, and on Google Fonts. You are free to replace everything with the ones you find great.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> : tex-gyre-fonts, free alternative to Helvetica and Arial and looks really really similar</li>
<li><code>serif</code> : Libertinus Serif, suprisingly looks really great</li>
<li><code>monospace</code> : DM Mono from Google Fonts, for monospace fonts that look great</li>
<li><code>emoji</code> : noto-fonts-emoji, get some colorful emojis</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Manjaro or Arch here is the command to get all fonts in one go.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">yay -S tex-gyre-fonts otf-libertinus noto-fonts-emoji
</code></pre></div><h3 id="font-setup">Font Setup</h3>
<p>Everything about fonts can be configured from a single file located at <code>/etc/fonts/local.conf</code> if the file doesn’t exist create it. You do require <code>sudo</code> for it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">sudo nvim /et/fonts/local.conf
</code></pre></div><p>After you are editing the file copy paste everything here.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

&lt;fontconfig&gt;

    &lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
  &lt;/edit&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>What this file does that is it creates aliases for the common fonts used on the web and uses the metric compatible fonts that we have. That way we have way better looking fonts.</p>
<p>After you have done all this, restart your computer to see the changes.</p>
<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>
<p>If you are using chrome, you can do something more too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goto Settings</li>
<li>Select Customize Fonts under Appearences</li>
<li>Set Standard to <code>Libertinus Serif</code></li>
<li>Set Serif to <code>Libertinus Serif</code></li>
<li>Set Sans-serif to <code>TeX Gyre Heros</code></li>
<li>Set Fixed-width to <code>Monospace</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interface-text">Interface Text</h3>
<p>For Desktop Environments like Gnome and KDE, you could use Tex-Gyre-Heros for the overall Helvetica look. I use Gnome 3.36 and use <code>TeX Gyre Heros Regular 10</code> as my interface text.</p>
<p>That’s all set, and keep in mind this guide will be improved.</p>

    <p> <i>Dear Reader: although this post mentions Clojure as an example, it is not specifically about Clojure; please do not make it part of a language war. If you know other configurations which allow for a productive REPL experience, please describe them in the comments!</i></p><p> <img src="https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/img/repl.gif" width="100%"></p><p>Most comparisons I see of Clojure to other programming languages are in terms of its programming language <em>semantics</em>:  immutability, homoiconicity, data-orientation, dynamic typing, first-class functions, polymorphism 'à la carte'...  All of these are interesting and valuable features, but what actually gets me to <em>choose</em> Clojure for projects is its interactive  development story, enabled by <em>the REPL</em> (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which lets you evaluate Clojure expressions in an interactive  shell (including expressions which let you modify the state or behaviour of a running program).  </p><p>If you're not familiar with Clojure, you may be surprised that I describe the REPL as Clojure's most differentiating feature:   after all, most industrial programming languages come with REPLs or 'shells' these days (including Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Scala,  Haskell, ...). However, I've never managed to reproduced the productive REPL workflow I had in Clojure with those languages;  the truth is that <strong>not all REPLs are created equal</strong>.</p><p>In this post, I'll try to describe what a 'good' REPL gives you, then list some technical characteristics which make some REPLs   qualify as 'good'. Finally, I'll try to reflect on what programming language features give REPLs the most leverage.</p><h2 id="what_does_a_good_repl_give_you?">What does a good REPL give you?</h2><p>The short answer is: by providing a <i>tight feedback loop</i>, and making your programs <i>tangible</i>,  a REPL helps you deliver programs with significantly higher productivity and quality.  If you're wondering why a tight feedback loop is important for creative activities such as programming, I recommend you watch  <a href="https://www.vimeo.com/36579366">this talk by Bret Victor</a>.</p><p>If you have no idea what REPL-based development looks like, I suggest you watch a few minutes of  <a href="https://vimeo.com/230220635" target="_blank">the following video</a>:</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/230220635" width="640" height="359" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Now, here's the long answer: <i>A good REPL gives you...</i></p><h3 id="a_smooth_transition_from_manual_to_automated">A smooth transition from manual to automated</h3><p>The vast majority of the programs we write essentially automate tasks that humans can do themselves.  Ideally, to automate a complex task, we should be able to break it down into smaller sub-tasks, then gradually automate each of the subtasks until reaching a fully-automated solution.  If you were to build a sophisticated machine like a computer from scratch, you would want to make sure you understand how the individual components work before putting them together, right?  Unfortunately, this is not what we get with the typical write/(compile)/run/watch-stdout workflow, in which we essentially put all the pieces together blindly and pray it works the first time we hit 'run'.  The story is different with a REPL: you will have played with each piece of code in isolation before running the whole program,  which makes you quite confident that each of the sub-tasks is well implemented.</p><p>This is also true in the other direction: when a fully-automated program breaks, in order to debug it,  you will want to re-play some of the sub-tasks manually.</p><p>Finally, not all programs need be fully automated - sometimes the middle ground between manual and automated is exactly what you want.  For instance, a REPL is a great environment to run ad hoc queries to your database, or perform ad hoc data analysis, while leveraging  all of the automated code you have already written for your project - much better than working with database clients, especially when  you need to query several data stores or reproduce advanced business logic to access the data.</p><p>How's life without a REPL? Here's a list of things that we do to cope with these issues when we don't have a REPL:</p><ul><li>Experiment with interactive tools such as cURL or database clients, then reproduce what we did in code.  Problem: you can't connect these in any way with your existing codebase. These tools are good at experimenting manually,  but then you have to code all the way to bridge the gap between making it work with these tools and having it work in your project.</li><li>Run scripts which call our codebase to print to standard output our files. Problem: you need to know exactly what to output before writing the script; you can't hold on to program state and <em>improvise</em> from there, as we'll discuss in the next section.</li><li>Use unit tests (possibly with auto-reloading), which have a number of limitations in this regard, as we'll see later in this post.</li></ul><h3 id="a_repl_lets_you_improvise">A REPL lets you improvise</h3><p>Software programming is primarily and <i>exploratory</i> activity.  If we had a precise idea of how our programs should work before writing them, we'd be <i>using</i> code, not writing it.</p><p>Therefore, we should be able to write our programs incrementally, one expression at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step,  <i>walking the machine through</i> our current thinking. This is simply not what the  compile/run-the-whole-thing/look-at-the-logs workflow gives you.</p><p>In particular, one situation where this ability is critical is fixing bugs in an emergency.  When you have to reproduce the problem, isolate the cause, simulate the fix and finally apply it, a REPL is often the  difference between minutes and hours.</p><p>Fun fact: maybe the most spectacular occurrence of this situation was the fixing of a bug  of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gZK0tW8EhQ">Deep Space 1</a> probe in 1999,  which fortunately happened to run a Common Lisp REPL while drifting off course several light-minutes away from Earth.</p><h3 id="a_repl_lets_you_write_fewer_tests,_faster">A REPL lets you write fewer tests, faster</h3><p>Automated tests are very useful for expressing what your code is supposed to do,  and giving you confidence that it works and keeps working correctly.</p><p>However, when I see some TDD codebases, it seems to me that a lot of unit tests are mostly here to make the code more tangible while developing, which is the same value proposition as using a REPL. However, using unit tests for this purpose comes with its lot of issues:</p><ol><li>Having too many unit tests makes your codebase harder to evolve. You ideally want to have as few tests as possible capture as many properties of your domain as possible.</li><li>Tests can only ever answer close-ended questions: "does this work?", but not "how does this work?", "what does this look like?" etc.</li><li>Tests typically won't run in real-world conditions: they'll use simple, artificial data and mocks of services such as databases or API clients. As a result, they don't typically help you understand a problem that only happens on real-life data, nor do they give you confidence that the real-life implementations of the services they emulate do work.</li></ol><p>So it seems to me a lot of unit tests get written for lack of a better solution for interactivity,  even though they don't really pull their weight as unit tests.  When you have a REPL, you can make the choice to only write the tests that matter.</p><p>What's more, the REPL <i>helps you</i> write these tests. Once you have explored from the REPL, you can just copy and paste  some of the REPL history to get both example data and expected output. You can even use the REPL to assist you in writing  the fixture data for your tests by generating it programmatically (everyone who has written comprehensive fixture datasets  by hand knows how tedious this can get). Finally, when writing the tests require implementing some non-trivial logic  (as is the case when doing Property-Based Testing), the productivity benefits of the REPL for writing code applies to writing tests as well.</p><p>Again, do <i>not</i> take from this that a REPL is a replacements for tests. Please do write tests, and let the REPL help you  write the right tests effectively.</p><h3 id="a_repl_makes_you_write_accessible_code">A REPL makes you write accessible code</h3><p>A REPL-based workflow encourages you to write programs which manipulate values that are <strong><i>easy to fabricate.</i></strong>  If you need to set up a complex graph of objects before you can make a single method call, you won't be very inclined to use the REPL.  </p><p>As a result, you'll tend to write <strong><i>accessible code</i></strong> - with few dependencies, little environmental coupling, high modularity,   and tangible inputs and outputs.  This is likely to make your code more clear, easy to test, and easy to debug.  </p><p>To be clear, this <i>is</i> an additional constraint on your code (it requires some upfront thinking to make your code REPL-friendly,  just likes it requires some upfront thinking to make your code easy to test) - but I believe it's a very beneficial constraint.  When my car engine breaks, I'm glad I can just lift the hood and access all the parts - and making this possible  has certainly put more work on the plate of car designers.</p><p>Another way a REPL makes code more accessible is that it makes it easier to learn, by providing a rich playground for beginners to experiment.  This applies to both learning languages and onboarding existing projects.</p><h2 id="what_makes_a_good_repl?">What makes a good REPL?</h2><p>As I said above, not all REPLs give you the same power.  Having experimented with REPLs in various configurations of language and tooling,  this is the list of the main things I believe a REPL should enable you to do to give you the most leverage:</p><ol><li><strong>Defining new behaviour / modify existing behaviour.</strong> For instance, in a procedural language, this means defining new functions, and modify the implementation of existing functions.</li><li><strong>Saving state in-memory.</strong> If you can't hold on to the data you manipulate, you will waster a ton of effort re-obtaining it - it's like doing your paperwork without a desk.</li><li><strong>Outputting values which can easily be translated to code.</strong> This means that the textual representation the REPL outputs is suitable for being embedded in code.</li><li><strong>Giving you access to your whole project code.</strong> You should be able to call any piece of code written in your project of its dependencies. As an execution …</li></ol></div></div>

        <span><time datetime="2020-09-24">24 Sep 2020</time> </span>

        

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It's the first thing that greets you when you look at an npm package, be it on npm itself or in the source on GitHub: The README.md file. But if you are like me, then writing documentation never was your strong suite - let alone maintaining and updating it.</p>
<p>What if, instead of having to update the README file manually whenever your code changes, the README could just stay up-to-date auto-magically? What if instead of having to remember which badges you need to add, this would all be done for you?</p>
<h2 id="introducingjsxreadme">Introducing jsx-readme</h2>
<p>Here's an example of using <code>jsx-readme</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// We need to tell the JSX transpiler that in this file,
// instead of React we use the custom createElement and Fragment
// functions from jsx-readme
/* @jsx MD */
/* @jsxFrag Fragment */
import type { Component } from "jsx-readme";
import MD, {
  BadgesFromPkg,
  CodecovBadge,
  DescriptionFromPkg,
  ExamplesFromPkg,
  Fragment,
  GithubWorkflowBadge,
  HomepageFromPkg,
  renderToFile,
  TitleFromPkg,
} from "jsx-readme";
import { Heading, InlineCode, LineBreak } from "jsx-md";
import pkg from "./package.json";

const Readme: Component = () =&gt; (
  &lt;Fragment&gt;
    {/* Create a header with title, badges and description inferred from package.json */}
    &lt;TitleFromPkg pkg={pkg} /&gt;
    &lt;BadgesFromPkg pkg={pkg} /&gt;
    {/* Add additional badges. */}
    &lt;CodecovBadge pkg={pkg} /&gt;
    &lt;GithubWorkflowBadge pkg={pkg} workflowName="Build and deploy" /&gt;
    &lt;LineBreak /&gt;
    &lt;DescriptionFromPkg pkg={pkg} /&gt;
    {/* You can use the components from jsx-md to build custom markdown. */}
    &lt;Heading level={2}&gt;Installation&lt;/Heading&gt;
    Add &lt;InlineCode&gt;jsx-readme&lt;/InlineCode&gt; to your{" "}
    &lt;InlineCode&gt;devDependencies&lt;/InlineCode&gt; and install it. I recommend using
    it with &lt;InlineCode&gt;ts-node&lt;/InlineCode&gt;. Then all you need to do is add a
    file like in the example below and run it via{" "}
    &lt;InlineCode&gt;ts-node&lt;/InlineCode&gt; whenever you want to create a new version
    of the &lt;InlineCode&gt;README&lt;/InlineCode&gt;.
    &lt;LineBreak /&gt;
    &lt;LineBreak /&gt;
    {/* Create an example section based on all files from the example directory set up in package.json */}
    &lt;ExamplesFromPkg pkg={pkg} /&gt;
    {/* Create a section linking to the homepage from package.json */}
    &lt;HomepageFromPkg pkg={pkg} /&gt;
  &lt;/Fragment&gt;
);

void renderToFile("./README.md", &lt;Readme /&gt;);
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, <code>jsx-readme</code> uses a React-like JSX syntax to define Markdown. It is built on top of <code>jsx-md</code> which you can also use independently, or together with <code>jsx-readme</code>, depending on your needs.</p>
<p>Since JSX is basically JavaScript, we can do in this file whatever we want. In this simple case we just import the local <code>package.json</code> file to read from it, but why not e. g. query the GitHub API to figure out who contributed and then adding them to your Readme?</p>
<p>And since it is just a TypeScript file, you can simply run it via e. g. <code>ts-node</code> instead of having to learn yet another CLI tool.</p>
<h2 id="sowhatdoesitlooklike">So what does it look like?</h2>
<p>The best way to understand the result of the script above is to just look at <a href="https://github.com/dbartholomae/jsx-readme/">the package itself</a> - <code>jsx-readme</code> uses it to create its own README.</p>

<![CDATA[Things Elixir's Phoenix Framework Does Right]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I dabbled in Phoenix for a while now, but never <em>really</em> got my hands dirty with it right up until now. Apart from the whole framework being surprisingly well thought through, there are a few things that strike me as being done <em>exceptionally</em> well in Phoenix, compared to the rest of modern web frameworks.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/phoenix.png" alt="Phoenix Framework Logo"></p><h3 id="1-striking-a-balance-between-flexibility-and-strictness">1. Striking a balance between flexibility and strictness</h3><p>Modern web frameworks can be roughly divided into two camps:</p><ul><li>Flexible “DIY” frameworks are a little more than a set of utilities for the most common web-related tasks. Most Go frameworks are like this, as well as ExpressJS. They enforce little to no rules for the structure of your applications and rely on the community to come up with the extensions and best practices. As a result, they are very flexible; those with a large community have extensions to perform any task imaginable. On the flip side, apps built on such a foundation can, given poor governance, slowly evolve into an unsupportable mess of incompatible plugins and mismatched coding styles.</li><li>Strict “batteries included” frameworks bring with them a complete set of tools to perform common web development tasks, as well as a set of conventions to go with it. They guide the developer into optimal code structure and typically strive to provide a single favored way of doing things. Of course, these kinds of frameworks are also extendable, but built-in tools often get embedded so deep into the project that they are almost irreplaceable. In this category, the most popular examples are Django and Ruby on Rails.</li></ul><p>Of course, most frameworks are not on an extreme end of the scale, but the distinction is there. Worth noting that neither group is strictly better than the other – each has its usecases.</p><p>Phoenix Framework, in my mind, holds very close to the middle of this scale for these reasons:</p><ul><li>it builds upon Elixir’s functional philosophy, so it has a very clear idea how things <em>should</em> work (single request context passed around as the first argument to all components that participate in a response generation, avoiding side effects where possible, MVC-inspired architecture, etc.)</li><li>it does not hide its internal details in a “black box”, quite the opposite - it encourages you to understand internal conventions to write your own code in the same fashion. When you get comfortable using a framework, you can probably read its code without too much trouble.</li><li>by default Phoenix comes with a huge pack of tools and utils (ORM, routing, test suit, HTML rendering, metrics dashboard (sic!)…), but in most cases, there’s a trivial way to swap them out or turn them off.</li></ul><h3 id="2-reactiveness">2. Reactiveness</h3><p>When an app requires bi-directional communication between client and server, you usually either
integrate a 3rd party library into the framework, which means writing a pile of glue code, or
use a specialized framework like Tornado, which (caution, personal opinion here) kind of an awkward choice for those parts of the web app that do not concern themselves with WebSockets.</p><p>Phoenix is great for classical HTTP, but persistent communication is where it <em>really</em> shines. Primitives it gives you with channels, PubSub and Presence are just enough to avoid boilerplate without sacrificing flexibility. Recent live view release is a whole new way of building dynamic apps. I wouldn’t go as far as to call it revolutionary, but it is definitely an intriguing attempt of bridging the gap between frontend and backend.</p><h3 id="3-performance">3. Performance</h3><p>Phoenix’s performance has surprisingly little to do with the framework itself. It inherited its impressive concurrence characteristics from Elixir, which got it from Erlang, which got it thanks to the primitives of the BEAM virtual machine and the architectural patterns of OTP. The main principle at work to achieve concurrency is to schedule lightweight threads of execution to run each independent piece of work concurrently. You might have seen this approach in other languages (goroutines, python’s greenlets, etc.), that’s because it works great to organize concurrent code execution without performance hit and with a minimal headache for a developer. However, BEAM gives this concept support on a VM level, which means it can be optimized even on a hardware level.</p><p>While lightweight processes help you perform well on your IO-bound tasks, Elixir being a compiled language means that CPU bound tasks won’t bottleneck easily as well, and perform on less computing resources than most alternatives. While I can’t be 100% sure that it will be faster for your application than Go or Rust in terms of CPU usage, I’m reasonably sure that it will be more than fast enough in a context of a typical web app.</p><p><em><strong>Update:</strong> correction based on discussion in here and on other platforms: Elixir is slower than Go/Rust on purely CPU-bound tasks, mainly because BEAM interrupts running threads for task scheduling. Also, Elixir/Erlang compiles to bytecode, not directly to the machine code (although BeamAsm, JIT compiler for Erlang’s VM, has <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">landed in master 4 days ago</a>, so this should change in the next OTP release).</em></p><h3 id="4-failure-tolerance-and-cluster-awareness">4. Failure tolerance and cluster-awareness</h3><p>You might have heard Phoenix being called a “monolithic framework”. This is true to some extent: Phoenix <em>does</em> encourage you to put your frontend, backend, and background tasks in the same app. However, it also provides facilities to ensure that failure in a single component of the app will not affect other independent components. To explain in short, the app is divided into processes that communicate with each other via kind-of event messages. Each component is supervised, the supervisor will catch unhandled failures and restart the process in an attempt to fix them. It’s somewhat reminiscent of a microservice architecture, just on a lower level.</p><p>Unlike most frameworks, Phoenix understands that it will most likely run on more than one node. It provides a way to communicate over the network in exactly the same way you communicate between the processes within your app.</p><p>This does not mean that Phoenix is a bad choice for microservices, it just means that framework itself can handle some of the same concerns microservices are designed to handle. A smaller app might benefit from that by avoiding some of the complexities of building up your own microservices architecture. Bigger apps, and those that are already built as microservices, can still incorporate Phoenix effectively.</p><h3 id="are-there-any-drawbacks">Are there any drawbacks?</h3><p>Elixir, and functional programming in general, is still a long way away from the mainstream. If you don’t know your way around closures, immutable data structures, and functional thinking it will take you a while before getting to feel comfortable with Phoenix. The good news is that functional programming is on an upwards trend, and with applications growing more parallel and distributed, I don’t think this trend will reverse any time soon. So the knowledge you acquire in the process will serve you well going forward, independent from what the future holds for Phoenix.</p><p>The included tooling is great, but you might miss some 3rd party SDK’s when you need them. That’s definitely something to consider when starting a project. To give you an example: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/">AWS</a> at the time of writing does not provide an official elixir client library.</p><p>Phoenix Framework a rock-solid, production-ready tool with a variety of usecases. It feels fresh and well thought through. I won’t be surprised if Phoenixes popularity continues to grow to reach the level of „Top tier“ frameworks in the next few years.</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

However, so far most of our readers still like our non-standard Deep Learning tutorial.</em></p><p>Typically, AI is demonstrated as solving various toy problems. AI plays chess and Go, AI plays video games, AI makes people dance. It is time to stop this madness and finally apply AI in a meaningful way. Therefore, we proudly present the dish-o-tron. The dish-o-tron is an AI system designed to solve an actual real-world problem impacting millions of people around the world every day: facing dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink.</p><div id="attachment_77683"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77683" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png" alt="dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink" width="250" height="107" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-700x300.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-768x329.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-1536x659.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-120x51.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77683">dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink – a real-world problem</p></div><p>Reading this blog series will equip you with the ultimate power to solve this long-lasting problem in your community kitchen once and for all by using state-of-the-art AI technology.</p><h2>The dish-o-tron</h2><p>At first glance, the dish-o-tron is an inconspicuous, well-positioned webcam in the kitchen observing the shared kitchen sink. In its natural state the dish-o-tron is just happy and enjoys life. The dish-o-tron doesn’t care whether you prefer tea or coffee and it likes all kinds of kitchen talk. However, there is one single thing that the dish-o-tron absolutely hates: watching someone put dirty dishes in the community sink.</p><p>Detecting dirty dishes in the sink enrages the peace-loving dish-o-tron so much that it starts beeping. The only way to return it to its natural peaceful state and thus stopping the noise is to admit one’s mistake and remove all dirty dishes from the community sink, leaving it neat and clean again.</p><p>Building the dish-o-tron requires three high-level steps:</p><ul><li>Gathering and preparing data</li><li>Training an AI model</li><li>Deployment of the model</li></ul><p>In the following, we will discuss these steps further.</p><h2>Gathering and preparing data</h2><p>Trying to solve real-world problems with AI often starts with the realisation that there is little or even no data available. This issue prevents many problem solvers from actually solving the problem. “If only data collection had started years ago!”, they say, “then we could now actually solve the problem”. While this is a reasonable thought, it simply doesn’t help.</p><p>Consoling users currently facing a problem by saying that it is necessary to gather lots of data for quite some time before we can start building a solution is at least challenging. Typically a more promising approach is to build a system addressing the problem which is able to improve over time.</p><p>In this way, we will not solve the problem completely in the first step; however, we will tackle the problem right away and put ourselves in a position to iteratively adjust the solution to match the requirements which also become more and more clear while working on the problem.</p><p>Since our problem is unique in a sense that there is no Kaggle dataset readily available, we start our journey to building the dish-o-tron by doing our best to collect a suitable dataset for a first working system.

In many cases this is still true today. Depending on the problem, we have to figure out a suitable model architecture and feature engineering and this requires some experimentation before we can train a suitable AI model. This is another issue which prevents problem solvers from building a solution tackling the whole problem even if data is available.</p><p>Fortunately, image classification is one of the best understood use cases in AI. There are lots of established best practices regarding model architectures and training of models. Among others this led to two things:</p><ul><li>High-level software libraries such as fast.ai which abstract away lots of the nitty-gritty details of image classification, providing a black-box kind of approach where state-of-the-art practises are simply utilised without burdening the user with the details.</li><li>Machine Learning as a service offerings from various public cloud providers such as automl and rekognition allowing training of image classification models on custom data in a few simple steps.</li></ul><p>Both approaches will typically not lead to the absolutely best solution. However, most of the time this is not necessary and ‘good enough’ will be just fine and a nice trade-off between time money spent vs. result. For our first version of the dish-o-tron, we will employ the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoML Service</a> from Google Cloud to train a first model.</p><p>We can use various tools to inspect the model and try to explain if the black box learns what we expect.</p><div id="attachment_77689"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77689" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png" alt="visualizing what the dish-o-tron model has actually learned" width="250" height="191" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-700x535.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-768x587.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-120x92.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77689">Visualizing what the model has actually learned.</p></div><p>The training of the AI model with AutoML and its technical details will be discussed in a follow-up blog post.</p><h2>Deployment of the model</h2><p>Having an AI model generally will not solve an actual real-life problem. For a viable solution, the AI model has to be integrated into a suitable context. Many times, this is the key step to generating any value at all. Nevertheless, this step is often postponed to the distant future after “collecting high quality data” and “building the best AI model”. This is, more often than not, a mistake because integrating the model into its context poses various challenges on its own. Hence, it should not be ignored and instead tackled early in order to learn and identify the associated challenges.</p><p>While building the dish-o-tron, we tried multiple options to run the model. We deployed it on a Pi Zero which is a really small and cheap device that can be glued anywhere with a small powerbank. But it is rather slow. We ran the model in the browser using our notebook’s webcam with TensorFlow.js. We used the Google AIY Kit, which is much faster than the Pi Zero and also comes with a beeper and blinking lights (but it is quite old and deploying state-of-the-art models is hacky). Finally, we used the Google Coral device, which is made for this kind of workload and well-integrated into Google AutoML but comes with a price tag.</p><p>The community kitchen is a special place. It’s a place where rumors are born, where gossip is produced and where you can openly chat about the most secret secrets of your company! That’s why dish-o-tron is living on the edge. Edge devices enable you to run audio and video analytics AND respect the privacy of your community kitchen. No image is transferred to the cloud. Nothing is saved. Dish-o-tron sees and forgets.</p><div id="attachment_77691"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77691" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png" alt="various edge devices" width="250" height="85" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-700x237.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-768x261.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-2048x695.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-120x41.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77691">Various edge devices</p></div><p>Moreover, the hardware we consider and buy in order to actually build the dish-o-tron will establish basic conditions for our solution space. In other words, we have to mind that it is possible to painlessly deploy the AI model on our preferred edge device. For the first version of the dish-o-tron, we decided to use a Google AIY kit (see video below). For the next version, we chose a Google Coral edge device, which allows us to run advanced computer vision tasks on a Raspberry-size mini computer. Fortunately, AutoML allows us to export models in a viable format.</p><div id="attachment_77693"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77693" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png" alt="Google coral device" width="250" height="131" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-700x366.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-768x401.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-1536x803.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-120x63.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77693">Google coral device</p></div><p>The construction of the dish-o-tron including the deployment of the model on the Coral device and its technical details will be discussed in an upcoming blog post.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI research has brought us new technology that can solve problems that couldn’t be solved before. Have you read the book AI superpowers by Kai-Fu Lee? He says that you don’t need to be one of the best AI researchers any more to apply AI and find new business opportunities. You need to collect (lots of) data and can “just” use existing algorithms, services and open source frameworks.

                    <p>A lot of trust needs to be put in to cryptocurrency exchanges. Firstly because you're entrusting them with your Fiat currency, and secondly because you're entrusting them with the <em>keys </em>to your cryptocurrency.</p><p>Each cryptocurrency address, regardless if it's Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum, is a public representation of a pair of <em>cryptographic keys</em>. That pair consists of two parts - a <strong>public </strong>key, and a <strong>private </strong>key. What's important here is that the <strong>private </strong>key is what allows you to make transactions, giving you the ability to transfer coins to other parties.</p><p>Now if you've ever used an exchange before, you'll notice that <strong>you don't normally see these keys</strong>. The exchange is managing it all for you in the background. They might have the keys for a Bitcoin or Ethereum address specifically created for your account in the background, which they're using to then make the trades that you ask them to via their website or app.</p><p>This is great, but those private keys? You're not going to see them. In fact if you transfer coins out of exchanges and <a href="https://live.blockcypher.com/">watch the transaction with a service like BlockCypher</a> - you'll often see the amount you transferred came from some address that was holding a lot more on it as a pool for multiple users, and your particular amount was divvied out to wherever you asked it to go with the remainer staying on the original address or moved somewhere else.</p><p>This kind of environment wasn't quite the intent for cryptocurrency - the intent was to <em>decentralise </em>- i.e. as a user, you control your own keys - not some larger authority like a bank. Most of the popular exchanges are well run and have proven themselves so far regarding trust and security, but ultimately they still hold your keys. They can assure you of their security controls and processes over and over, even enabling 2-Factor Authentication to <em>really</em> lock down access with YubiKeys, OTP tokens, and SMS codes. They can assure you that they provide cold storage services to <em>really</em> lock down access. But even 5 or 500 layers of security, never forget <strong>- they still hold your keys</strong>.</p><h2 id="so-what-should-you-do">So what should you do?</h2><p>The first step is to take ownership back. Most exchanges provide a capability to <em>send</em> your holdings to another address. They usually bury that feature behind a bunch of menus, but you should hopefully find the capability. All you need to do is create addresses in a product under your control, like <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a>, and then you can use those addresses as the destination for sending your holdings from the exchange.</p><p>The second step is to enable 2FA on the exchange. Yes, we've just outlined why 2FA isn't enough to protect your holdings - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be using it anyway. At some point you're going to want to move your holding from Signata back into the exchange to trade them for fiat (or other currencies). If your exchange supports YubiKeys for 2FA, then great! - you can use your same YubiKey for both logging in to the exchange, and protecting your private keys in <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a>.</p><p>The most secure way to keep cryptocurrency is to stay decentralised. Be the owner of your crypto assets, and keep the power to send them wherever and whenever you want. Don't let exchanges hold on to your assets - hold them in a wallet that <em>you</em> control. <a href="https://signata.net/">Try Signata today for free</a> - you can add as many addresses and YubiKeys and you like, and we never see your private keys.</p>

<p>There’s an ongoing discussion about what makes Python better prototyping
language than Rust (with Python being probably just the archetype of some
scripted weakly-typed language). The thing is, I prefer doing my prototypes in
Rust over Python. Apparently, I’m not the only one. So I wanted to share few
things about what makes Rust viable for these kinds of throw-away coding
sprints, at least for me.</p>

<h2 id="our-goals">Our goals</h2>

<p>Sometimes, our goal isn’t really to write perfect code that is performant,
correct, handles all kinds of errors sanely, has great UX and is maintainable.
These projects are what we are proud of, sure. We pin them on github profiles.
We write blog posts about them. We write whole handbooks of best practices how
to do them.</p>

<p>But sometimes we just need to throw something together really fast and don’t
care about the quality as much. That kind of bit of cardboard and huge amount of
duck tape thing. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single-use debugging tools („I need to throw 10k of these weird requests at
the server to see if it triggers the bug. It didn’t? Ok, let’s try something
else…“)</li>
  <li>Searching for a counter-example to a claim in a scientific paper („I can prove
it’s a counter example once I have it, so I won’t need the code any more“)</li>
  <li>Processing bunch of data just once („I wonder how many of these <code>.txt</code> files
have broken unicode in them“)</li>
  <li>Figuring if something has any chance to fly at all, before committing to it
(„Could I distribute the changes as compressed binary diffs, or would that be
too large?“)</li>
  <li>Demonstration purposes („We would like to build something in lines of this,
but, you know, actually working“)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there’s a lot more. I’m not even sure if there’s more of the „proper“
coding or of this „throw away“ coding. Except that we don’t really brag about
our throw-away code („Look what terrible monster I’ve stitched together during
the lunch break“), we don’t write tutorials how to write them much, etc. So this
is exactly the kind of blog post we don’t write 😈.</p>

<p>Instead of writing something proper this time, we are going to talk about
how to write terrible code, but fast. We have decided to make an explicitly
sloppy job of this one and admit it to ourselves not to feel ashamed of it
later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We want to spend as little time on it as possible. Just do it, throw the code
away after it had its use and move on. This one is going to be over by lunch
time.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about performance that much (as long as it finishes running
before the lunch too).</li>
  <li>We don’t care about handling all corner cases, only the ones we actually
encounter in the data.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about documentation or readability.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about tests, provided we are confident enough the answers are
accurate enough.</li>
  <li>Actually, we don’t really care at all…</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: make sure not to let anyone put this into production 😇. If you don’t
delete it, make sure there’s a comment on a prominent place warning people not
to use it.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-think-python-fits-here-better-than-rust">Why do people think Python fits here better than Rust</h2>

<p>The thing is, Rust <em>makes us</em> care. That’s one of the points of Rust. It’ll
complain that our code is not production quality and that we need to do better
to save on the pain down the line. Its type system can be a real prick in
insisting on little details, like that ints and strings are not really the same
thing and that there’s a difference between owned and borrowed thing and… Well,
you know, all that stuff. Rust wants you to make good, proper, maintainable
code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Python doesn’t really insist on anything. Therefore, it is
easier to not care in Python.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-experience">My own experience</h2>

<p>I know a bunch of programming languages and reach for the one that I hope would
suit me best in the given time. So, for some really simple things I simply put
together few lines of shell (and some slightly less simple ones ‒ I’m ashamed to
admit that some 1000 lines long shell monster kept running in real production
for years ‒ but it <em>did run</em>). If it can be done by 2 or 3 ugly pipelines, it’s
fine.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve used Perl a lot (that one doesn’t care if it’s int or
string… no, correction, in Perl everything is a string, ints just don’t exist.
Well, kind of). It’s probably <em>the</em> language designed for throw away coding.
I’ve done some Python too (that’s like Perl, but with proper objects in it, and
everything is a dictionary there).</p>

<p>But recently I’ve noticed that if I try to do a similar thing, I do it faster in
Rust. Not that it runs faster (well, that usually too, but that’s not the
point), but that I’m done with the task at hand sooner and with slightly smaller
amount of cursing.</p>

<p>This certainly is in part because I’m more proficient in Rust than in Python.
It’s also because the Rust mental model is closer to how my brain works than the
Python one. <strong>Your mileage will vary</strong> ‒ if you’re a Python matador who’s been
coding in it for decades and are just learning Rust, you’ll certainly do it
faster in Python.</p>

<p>But also, there are some tricks you might employ to do these things in Rust
faster (that is, faster than you do now, not necessarily faster than in
<code>$OTHER_LANGUAGE</code>).</p>

<h2 id="tricks-for-faster-coding">Tricks for faster coding</h2>

<h3 id="compile-times">Compile times</h3>

<p>Rust is known for its slow compile times. Python has <em>no</em> compile times. If you
have to wait every time for the compilation just to have a bunch of errors
thrown into your face, it’s going to slow you down. Especially because Rust
<em>likes to</em> throw bunch of errors at you every time you try to compile it. Rust
is known for its great error messages, so it wants to brag how good they are by
using them <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>You can, however, notice that you don’t really need to <em>build and run</em> every
time. That you often just want to check everything is on the right path. For
Python, you do need to actually run the thing (because Python doesn’t really
have much of a compile time so it likes to throw the bunch of errors into your
face at <em>run time</em>), but Rust is the language that „if
it compiles, it’s correct“. And by complies, I actually mean mostly type-checks.</p>

<p>What does this all mean? You can check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>rust-analyzer</code> language server. You’ll be getting red squiggles in the
editor instead of having to compile. It’s not perfect (sometimes the list of
errors is different, sometimes it just gives up on that particular project),
but it’s getting better and it points out most of the errors without any
compilation at all.</li>
  <li><code>cargo check</code> performs just the first stages of compilation and will stop
before codegen. It means it doesn’t produce anything that could be run, but
it is so much faster and provides the bunch of errors we so much want to have.</li>
  <li>You can let <code>cargo watch</code> keep recompiling the code asynchronously in another
terminal. I just glance at it to check if there are any errors around, but I
don’t wait for it ‒ at worst, the list of errors is one iteration outdated. It
can be used for other things, like keeping the documentation of the current
crate up to date, or having a head start at compiling the executable, or even
having all the tests being re-run on each save (I’m getting off topic here; we
are being sloppy here on purpose, so what tests are we talking about?)</li>
</ul>

<p>These don’t make the compile times shorter, but it eliminates the <em>waiting</em> for
them from the hot coding path. It still takes some time to compile (especially
if you have a lot of dependencies and do a clean release build), but that
doesn’t mean it has to slow you down.</p>

<h3 id="embrace-the-type-system-and-borrow-checker-and-all-of-these-things">Embrace the type system (and borrow checker and all of these things)</h3>

<p>After some time working with Rust, one learns to lean onto them instead of
fighting them.</p>

<p>This is where most of my own speed up comes from and what I miss about Python.
When I want to know if my code is working, I actually have to run the Python
thing and feed it with data. Which means I either need to set up a smaller input
or wait for the whole thing to get crunched, only to have it explode on some
typo or switched order of parameters after 5 minutes of running. After 10
iterations of running the Python code (each crashing later and later in the
code), it finally finishes. By that time, I’m no longer confident it does what
it should, after all these retries, so I go back and have to figure a way to
double-check it.</p>

<p>In Rust not only I don’t have to run the code until it is almost finished and
even when I feed it the whole input (which I usually do), it’s usually faster
and it runs to completion the first time. I also can move through the code much
faster. With Python, I stop to check the documentation, think about what type
goes where, etc, exactly because it’s so painful to find out only at runtime. I
need to be careful while writing the code.
With Rust, I just type the code, get the red squiggly, fix it and move on. I
outsource that effort of checking if these things click together in any
meaningful way to the compiler.</p>

<p>This is kind of in the theme of „hurry slowly“ approach. By making sure
everything has the right types and aligns well, it makes each iteration slower.
But it also makes it possible to have much fewer iterations before the whole
thing works well enough.</p>

<p>Also, don’t fall for the impression that throwing <code>unsafe</code> in there to bypass
some of the checking will save you time. It won’t. It’s a trap. If you don’t
know for sure that you need it, then you probably don’t and doing <code>unsafe</code> right
is a lot of work. Doing it wrong is easy, maybe easier than doing it safely, but
you’ll pay for it later on, when trying to figure out why the thing does
something arcanely weird. If you put any non-trivial <code>unsafe</code> in the code,
you’re risking spending days and nights in front of a debugger. The checks are
there for a reason.</p>

<h3 id="take-the-easy-way-out">Take the easy way out</h3>

<p>I don’t say to clone everything. Even in prototyping code, I often take <code>&amp;str</code>
as parameter if it’s just „looking at it“. But I do so in the obvious, trivial
cases. The ones I don’t really need to think about any more.</p>

<p>But if you ever find yourself thinking about writing any kind of
<code>-&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = &amp;impl Display&gt; + '_</code>, just stop and throw a
<code>Vec&lt;String…</code></p></section></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First blog post! For this blog post i would like to talk about various issues around linters which exclusively use ASTs (Abstract Syntax Tree) for linting source code, and a tree representation you may not know about. Over many months of working on a JavaScript linter in rust called <a href="https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/tree/dev">rslint</a> i have encountered numerous issues and have explored many concepts which i feel i should share to offer insights into why i believe purely AST based linting is unfit for complex linters.</p>

<p>This post mostly refers to the issues with pure typed AST based linting in statically typed languages such as rust, However, most of the issues occur in dynamically typed languages too.</p>

<p>I will be giving a small introduction to how linters work, feel free to skip to the <a href="#Problems-with-ASTs">Problems with ASTs</a> if you already know how linters work.</p>

<p>Linters are programs which statically analyze code for semantic, stylistic, and potentially erroneous issues. Linters traditionally work by taking source code, then running a parser on the source code, which yields an abstract representation of the program called an abstract syntax tree. Popular examples of linters include ESLint for JavaScript, and Clippy for rust. Some linters further rely on typechecking information like clippy, however i will not be focusing on that aspect for this post.</p>

<p>Once an abstract syntax tree has been built, the linter crawls (visits) the tree’s nodes (Items like an if statement, an if statement’s condition, its body, etc) and runs specific “rules” on the node. An example of a rule may be ESLint’s <code>no-empty</code>, which visits block statements and checks if they contain no nodes and no comments.</p>

<p>Linters often offer autofix too, where the linter changes the source code to fix the issue for you. Usually this relies on text transformations, but many linters use AST transformations too.</p>



<p>Purely typed ASTs may appear to be the logical choice best choice when making a linter, however, ASTs have many inherent flaws which can make writing stylistic or more complex rules extremely inefficient or difficult. The main issues with purely typed ASTs include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Often expensive to clone and pass around</li>
  <li>Complex Node traversal is impossible without runtime typing, and even with runtime typing it is extremely constrained.</li>
  <li>No straightforward way to obtain individual tokens or child nodes</li>
  <li>Lossy, no way to cleanly and efficiently represent whitespace inside of them, which is crucial for stylistic linting.</li>
  <li>Require explicit handling of their structures in the parser</li>
  <li>Mutable, which is fine for most cases but you really do not want mutable trees for static analysis in a language without a GC.</li>
  <li>Makes error recovery for a parser very constrained</li>
  <li>Incremental reparsing is impossible</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s go through each of the issues one by one:</p>

<h2 id="expensive-to-clone">Expensive to clone</h2>

<p>AST nodes usually hold a decently large amount of information, this means if you want to pass around a node to an individual sub-analyzer (say, scope analysis) you must either pass references (would likely get you into lifetime hell very quickly), or clone the structure. Cloning the structure can often be relatively expensive due to the amount of information it holds, lets take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/swc-project/swc">swc</a> type definition for a Js/Ts class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Irrelevant serde attributes omitted */</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Class</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>span</span><span>:</span> <span>Span</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>decorators</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Decorator</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ClassMember</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>super_class</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>is_abstract</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>type_params</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TsTypeParamDecl</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>super_type_params</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TsTypeParamInstantiation</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>implements</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TsExprWithTypeArgs</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s say you made a scope analyzer, and you would like to be able to get the declared classes inside of a scope. You would have to expensively clone the class, or store the span, which leaves out info you may want such as the class’ body. This often constrains the info a sub-analyzer can hold, and subsequently constrains complex error rendering.</p>

<h2 id="complex-node-traversal-is-impossible">Complex node traversal is impossible</h2>

<p>It is very common for a rule to want to know about the node’s parent/sibling/children/descendants. However, that is impossible without runtime typing in a statically typed language. Why exactly? well, AST nodes are standalone, they do not know about parents or siblings, they can only traverse top-down using explicit visitors. This brings about a couple of issues:</p>

<h3 id="need-for-visitors">Need for visitors</h3>

<p>ASTs are typed, which means to visit each node you need to explicitly handle every single node and visit each of their children explicitly. Which means you must either use a complex proc macro to generate a visit trait for you, or you need to implement it yourself, which is a gigantic pain and is impractical.</p>

<p>Moreover, Visit traits work by offering the visit functions as provided trait methods, but this means when you override them to check items you end up not visiting child nodes! This means you need must visit each child manually, which results in a ton of boilerplate code. A real world example of why this is a problem is <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint">deno_lint</a>, deno lint is incapable of catching <code>no-unsafe-finally</code> for this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/* */</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>"</span><span>oh no</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because deno_lint’s <code>no-unsafe-finally</code> rule overrides the try statement visit method:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>visit_try_stmt</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>try_stmt</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>TryStmt</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>parent</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* */</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And does not recursively visit the body of the try statement, the catch body, or the finalizer statements.</p>

<p>To fix this major issue in many of deno_lint’s rules it would have to change every single visit function on every rule to include recursively visiting the children manually.</p>

<p>And finally, requiring a visitor introduces a big amount of boilerplate into each rule definition, let’s use deno_lint as an example again:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>LintRule</span> <span>for</span> <span>NoUnsafeFinally</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

    <span>/* rule checks omitted*/</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Compared to rslint’s implementation (which is able to catch nested errors) which uses bottom-up node checking:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>declare_lint!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/* documentation omitted */</span>
    <span>#[derive(Default)]</span>

        <span>None</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>/* self.output error rendering */</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way of using a visitor means each rule is actually made up of two structs, and the second struct needs to store an <code>Arc&lt;Context&gt;</code> to be able
to add diagnostics. This further introduces more issues i won’t get deep into but they include requiring the diagnostics vector in the context to be locked (through a mutex) to add a diagnostic, and not being able to cleanly refer to each rule’s diagnostics/outcome.</p>

<h3 id="bottom-up-rule-checking">Bottom-up rule checking</h3>

<p>Bottom-up rule checking is impossible, which many rules benefit greatly from, such as <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-await-in-loop"><code>no-await-in-loop</code></a>.
This is because a node cannot know about its parent, swc’s visitor attempts to slightly get around this with a <code>_parent: &amp;dyn Node</code> on ever visitor function which is a simple wrapper on top of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/trait.Any.html"><code>Any</code></a>. This still does not allow for recursive bottom-up checking, and it introduces the mess of needing to downcast the parent.</p>

<p>The fact that bottom-up rule checking is impossible means every rule must be a bottom-down check, which is usually ugly for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oftentimes a rule wants to check a node, but only if its the child of a specific node, which requires explicit handling of each possible parent (see: <code>no-extra-boolean-cast</code>)</li>
  <li>It results in duplicate code for each parent</li>
</ul>

<p>Proof of this can be found in deno_lint’s <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint/blob/master/src/rules/no_await_in_loop.rs">implementation</a> of <code>no-await-in-loop</code>, which is 182 lines, versus rslint’s <a href="https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint/blob/dev/rslint_core/src/groups/errors/no_await_in_loop.rs">implementation</a> which is 35 lines.</p>

<h2 id="no-easy-access-to-tokens-or-child-nodes">No easy access to tokens or child nodes</h2>

<p>ASTs are lossy, like the name implies, this means that it is impossible to straight from a node to its tokens. It may seem like a small issue but in reality it poses a ton of issues, these include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No lexical equality (counting <code>foo. bar</code> and <code>foo.bar</code> as the same expression)</li>
  <li>No simple implementation of individual token based rules</li>
  <li>No easy syntax highlighting without reinvoking the lexer</li>
  <li>No easy way to refer to an individual token for pretty errors</li>
</ul>

<p>To get around this, tools like ESLint store the tokens in a store then have methods on a context object to get the tokens. As you can probably guess, this brings about more issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No interning, which can make storing tokens expensive for things like <code>let</code>, <code>var</code>, etc.</li>
  <li>Another thing to implement and maintain.</li>
  <li>Tokens don’t know about their parent AST nodes .</li>
  <li>cont: Tokens cannot traverse their siblings, next tokens, prev tokens, etc.</li>
  <li>No whitespace and comment tokens, which results in ugly handling of comments and comment directives.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lossy">Lossy</h2>

<p>ASTs are lossy, this makes stylistic …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Web Components had so much potential to empower HTML to do more, and make web development more accessible to non-programmers and easier for programmers. Remember how exciting it was every time we got new shiny HTML elements that actually <em>do stuff</em>? Remember how exciting it was to be able to do sliders, color pickers, dialogs, disclosure widgets straight in the HTML, without having to include any widget libraries?</p>



<p>The promise of Web Components was that we’d get this convenience, but for a much wider range of HTML elements, developed much faster, as nobody needs to wait for the full spec + implementation process. We’d just include a script, and boom, we have more elements at our disposal!</p>



<p>Or, that was the idea. Somewhere along the way, the space got flooded by JS frameworks aficionados, who revel in complex APIs, overengineered build processes and dependency graphs that look like the roots of a banyan tree.</p>



<figure><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2025/32441377780_e3acf6de12_b.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>This is what the roots of a Banyan tree look like. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/79721788@N00/32441377780/">Photo by David Stanley on Flickr (CC-BY)</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Perusing the components on <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">webcomponents.org</a> fills me with anxiety, and I’m perfectly comfortable writing JS — I write JS for a living! What hope do those who can’t write JS have? Using a custom element from the directory often needs to be preceded by a ritual of npm flugelhorn, import clownshoes, build quux, all completely unapologetically because “here is my truckload of dependencies, yeah, what”. Many steps are even omitted, likely because they are “obvious”. Often, you wade through the maze only to find the component doesn’t work anymore, or is not fit for your purpose.</p>



<p>Besides setup, the main problem is that HTML is not treated with the appropriate respect in the design of these components. They are not designed as closely as possible to standard HTML elements, but <em>expect</em> JS to be written for them to do anything. HTML is simply treated as a shorthand, or worse, as merely a marker to indicate where the element goes in the DOM, with all parameters passed in via JS. I recall <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/12839#webcomponents">a wonderful talk by Jeremy Keith</a> a few years ago about this very phenomenon, where he discussed <a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org/">this e-shop Web components demo by Google</a>, which is the poster child of this practice. These are the entire contents of its <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;shop-app unresolved=""&gt;SHOP&lt;/shop-app&gt;
	&lt;script src="node_assets/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script type="module" src="src/shop-app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script&gt;window.performance&amp;&amp;performance.mark&amp;&amp;performance.mark("index.html");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>



<p>If this is how Google is leading the way, how can we hope for contributors to design components that follow established HTML conventions?</p>



<p>Jeremy criticized this practice from the aspect of backwards compatibility: when JS is broken or not enabled, or the browser doesn’t support Web Components, the entire website is blank. While this is indeed a serious concern, my primary concern is one of <strong>usability</strong>: <strong>HTML is a lower barrier to entry language</strong>. Far more people can write HTML than JS. Even for those who do eventually write JS, it often comes after spending years writing HTML &amp; CSS.</p>



<p>If components are designed in a way that requires  JS, this excludes thousands of people from using them. And even for those who <em>can</em> write JS, HTML is often easier: you don’t see many people rolling their own sliders or using JS-based ones once <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> became widely supported, right?</p>



<p>Even when JS is unavoidable, it’s not black and white. A well designed HTML element can reduce the amount and complexity of JS needed to a minimum. Think of the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">&lt;dialog&gt;</a></code> element: it usually does require *some* JS, but it’s usually rather simple JS. Similarly, the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is perfectly usable just by writing HTML, and has a comprehensive JS API for anyone who wants to do fancy custom things.</p>



<p>The other day I was looking for a simple, dependency free, tabs component. You know, the canonical example of something that is easy to do with Web Components, the example 50% of tutorials mention. I didn’t even care what it looked like, it was for a testing interface. I just wanted something that is small and works like a normal HTML element. Yet, it proved so hard I ended up writing my own!</p>



<h3>Can we fix this?</h3>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a design issue, or a documentation issue. Perhaps for many of these web components, there are easier ways to use them. Perhaps there are vanilla web components out there that I just can’t find. Perhaps I’m looking in the wrong place and there is another directory somewhere with different goals and a different target audience. </p>



<p>But if not, and if I’m not alone in feeling this way, we need a directory of web components with strict inclusion criteria:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plug and play.</strong> No dependencies, no setup beyond including one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. If a dependency is absolutely <em>needed</em> (e.g. in a map component it doesn’t make sense to draw your own maps), the component loads it automatically if it’s not already loaded.</li><li>Syntax and API follows <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/"><strong>conventions established by built-in HTML elements</strong></a> and anything that <em>can</em> be done without the component user writing JS, <em>is</em> doable without JS, per <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">the W3C principle of least power</a>.</li><li><strong>Accessible by default</strong> via sensible ARIA defaults, just like normal HTML elements.</li><li><strong>Themable</strong> via <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part">::part()</a></code>, selective inheritance and custom properties. Very minimal style by default. Normal CSS properties should just “work” to the the extent possible.</li><li><strong>Only one component of a given type</strong> in the directory, that is <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>extensible</strong> and continuously iterated on and improved by the community. Not 30 different sliders and 15 different tabs that users have to wade through. No branding, no silos of “component libraries”. Only elements that are designed as closely as possible to what a browser would implement in every way the current technology allows.</li></ul>



<p>I would be up for working on this if others feel the same way, since that is not a project for one person to tackle. <em>Who’s with me?</em></p>

	<div>

		<p>There has been a lot of discussion coming to my attention recently regarding data oriented design (DOD) or data oriented architecture (DOA). It is something very close to my heart because I love optimisation; I have to do it for all the products I work on as a software engineer and so I am always thinking about the data first. Being data oriented is thinking about the data you have and the transformations you need to make, to get the output you desire on the hardware you are targeting.</p>

<p>When it comes to DOD a lot of the discussion (sometimes the only discussion) is about entity component systems (ECS) using structure of arrays (SoA) to improve cache utilisation. Every man and his dog now knows about “The Cache” and I hear them throw around the term “Cache Coherency” incorrectly (when it actually describes a <a href="https://bit.ly/2HkUR4S">different problem</a> present in CPU architectures). I have worked with a number coders who continually try bringing cache efficiency optimisation into discussion at the wrong place and the wrong time, having never actually applied any DOD themselves. This is very frustrating because it is not something that has a one size fits all solution, they just picked up a few buzzwords thinking they know it all and some people have spent many, many sleepless nights grinding out those final CPU cycles to hit a target frame rate.</p>

<p>My interest in DOD all started when I was optimising CPU code for PS3 and Xbox360 games, I was deep in crunch and trying to grind out a 60hz fixed timestep update on a single PowerPC Unit (PPU) where having to shave off even a few milliseconds became increasingly difficult. We had PC ports of the projects which ran smooth as butter and there was a time I did not know the inherent differences in CPU architectures of PPU vs x86/64. But then I found great talks and blog posts from other devs explaining what was happening and how DOD was a way to solve the issues. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">talk</a> from Mike Acton was the canonical one of the time.</p>

<p>The PPU that I was optimising for was only capable of in-order execution or incapable of out-of-order (OoO) execution. This meant that CPU stalls while waiting for L2 cache-misses were one of the biggest penalties you were likely to see (~600 CPU cycles). The profiling tools for various platforms made this abundantly clear by highlighting cache-misses, but if you didn’t know about the problem of in-order execution and tried to optimise code at the instruction level, it would make little difference. The performance cost here was not as a result of the PPU doing too much work that needed reducing, it was because the PPU would be idle while waiting for data and unable to process anything else. CPU stalls can occur for a number of reasons; we may be reading from disk, we may miss the instruction cache or data cache, and even at the instruction level we have to wait some amount of CPU cycles for the result to complete. DOD helped to minimise the stalls and maximise data throughput. Compilers schedule operations to hide instruction latency, loop unrolling is an example of this and is effective because we can issue and interleave operations while we wait for latency in the pipeline. Modern, more advanced CPU’s can do more effective things with OoO hiding even greater latencies.</p>

<p>CPU pipelines these days are typically much more complex than the older PPU’s so the same techniques which worked on a PS3 might not be applicable or necessary today. PPU had costly penalties for branching, especially when SIMD was involved you could perform additional redundant ALU operations, which got masked out instead of taking a branch. These branch evasion strategies were also crucial in shader code on GPU’s of the same era. Modern x86 CPU’s have good branch predictors and I have found that taking a branch can be more efficient than doing more ALU and masking a result, but again it all depends on the hardware and what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>DOD doesn’t have to be (and shouldn’t be) all about SoA like some people seem to think. My first optimisations with my new found insights were quick and dirty because we were at the end of a development cycle. I made changes which split out transforms and matrices into linear arrays from the ~400 byte monolithic <code>GameObject</code> base class and generated matrices from transforms, did hierarchical matrix multiplications, and performed frustum culling on a more cache efficient set of data. I also generated a list of active physics objects to lookup and update only active objects, instead of dereferencing a polymorphic object and drilling through a call stack only to early out when the object was inactive. This list was updated each frame as a byproduct of another update operation so was almost for free. These were simple optimisations that improved data cache utilisation, but also just reduced general overhead of calling functions and pointer chasing. They were by no means the most efficient solution, but they were certainly way more efficient than the previous implementation and they helped to ship a game with a fixed timestep at 60hz for every level of the game.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that I consider to be data oriented optimisations. Loading binary files that have been prepared offline into a runtime ready layout so they can just be loaded straight into RAM with no unpacking or computational work is data oriented. Preparing textures that are already in a tiled GPU specific memory layout so it can just go straight into GPU would be an example of this, however if you have a large amount of data, and a platform with small storage, you may need to use precious CPU cycles to perform work to uncompress it so that it can fit onto flash storage, this is also DOD. You need to fit your data into the constraints of the hardware, runtime performance is not the only goal, memory usage might be a limitation, bandwidth might be an issue… and so on.</p>

<p>The last game I shipped is a live action (FMV) game with a huge amount of video data. The video data needs to be streamed from the internet, buffered onto HDD, loaded into RAM, and decoded on the GPU. We can playback videos and take many different storyline branches with video frames ready to render at literally zero latency because of prefetching, buffering and some lockless CPU/GPU synchronisation. The tools and build processes to manipulate data into forms that make it possible to achieve these goals are also data oriented. It isn’t just the runtime; from the initial conception and authoring of content until it is transmitted into a consumers eye balls is just one big long data oriented process.</p>

<p>Flippantly people say “we have larger CPU caches and clever branch predictors now… we don’t need DOD anymore”, do not discount the number of memory or performance limited embedded systems around, and in use today. Do not underestimate the difference a few microseconds saving inside a hot loop can save money (cloud services) or increase revenue (trading systems). Until you have a concrete application you cannot begin real data oriented design… The real process begins when you understand your architecture, profile your code, measure the results and find out what works best in that scenario, be it performance, data size or whatever else you may need to achieve.</p>

<p>Having said all of this, I do have my own game engine which has a SoA ECS, I will write a post about this, the history behind it and some of the decisions I made, if anyone cares to listen.</p>

<p>At the end of the day DOD is just all about the data. The king is the data, long live the data.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I work as a senior software developer at a startup. We mainly provide APIs to integrate voice and sms services into applications. So naturally our complete infrastructure is on a cloud provider, which in our case is AWS. </p>
<p>For someone who has not worked on managing infrastructure on cloud, it can be very difficult to understand different components involved in building scalable applications. For me personally, I didn't know anything about AWS concepts before I started woking here. In the last 2.5 years I've learnt so much on AWS and knowing the importance of learning these concepts, I decided to write a series of articles for people who want to get started with AWS or any other cloud services provider in general. This is the first article in the series.</p>
<p>AWS is one of the market leaders who provides cloud computing services and powers the applications behind companies like Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, NASA etc.</p>
<p>As a software developer it's important to know about different cloud computing services which are needed to build distributed, highly scalable applications. If you've not worked on infrastructure yet, you'll definitely get to work on it in your development career at some point. In this article I'll cover some of the important services we use from AWS.</p>
<p>AWS provides numerous services but below are the commonly used ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ec2">Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a></li>
<li><a href="#rds">Relational Database Service (RDS)</a></li>
<li><a href="#ecs">Elastic Container Service (ECS)</a></li>
<li><a href="#elasticache">ElastiCache</a></li>
<li><a href="#s3">Simple Storage Service (S3)</a></li>
<li><a href="#sqs">Simple Queuing Service (SQS)</a></li>
<li><a href="#load-balancer">Load Balancer</a></li>
<li><a href="#route53">Route 53</a></li>
<li><a href="#lambda">AWS Lambda</a></li>
<li><a href="#vpc">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lessa-idec2greaterlessagreater-1-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2"><a id="ec2"></a> 1. Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):</h3>
<p>EC2 instances are basically servers with an operating system which can be used to run your applications on the internet just like you run your applications on your laptop during development.</p>
<p>EC2 machines come with different configurations for CPU, Memory, Ram etc. They are categorised based on their computing power, memory optimisation, storage optimisation etc. For example all the memory optimised instances belong to <strong>m</strong> family. All the compute optimised instances belong to <strong>c</strong> family etc.</p>
<p>You can use these instances to run backend servers, background scripts, database servers, front end applications etc.</p>
<p>Since we have many micro services for powering our APIs, we use these instances along with Elastic Container Service (container orchestration service) to deploy our docker containers. We even use standalone EC2 instances as jumpbox hosts for running any ad-hoc scripts to perform tasks like backfill data, connect to private database, redis cache etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/d4jelj93xx9gocwqvtn9.jpeg" alt="ec2_image"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-idrdsgreaterlessagreater-2-relational-database-service-rds"><a id="rds"></a> 2. Relational Database Service (RDS):</h3>
<p>RDS is a distributed relational database service.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types - optimised for memory, performance or I/O - and provides six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS allows your to create read replicas in the same region or on a different region. You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput.Read replicas can also be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances.</p>
<p>We use PostgreSQL for all of our main databases and RedShift to keep the data needed for analytics and reporting. There's one central database where the common data is stored and separate databases where data related to different products owned by respective teams are stored.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/q7kxr8vn4pwxvwte8bc5.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-23 at 10.40.27 PM"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-idecsgreaterlessagreater-3-elastic-container-service-ecs"><a id="ecs"></a> 3. Elastic Container Service (ECS):</h3>
<p>AWS ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service.</p>
<p>ECS has been a foundational pillar for key Amazon services and it can natively integrate with other services such as Amazon Route 53, Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch providing you a familiar experience to deploy and scale your containers.</p>
<p>You can add auto scaling to your ECS clusters to scale up or scale down the number of instances and tasks depending on your traffic needs. When your services are getting high traffic you can increase the number of cluster instances and service tasks. Similarly you can decrease them when the traffic is less. For example you can keep a desired count of 4 containers for a particular service. Using auto scaling you can setup rules like if the CPU % goes beyond 80%, add 2 more containers. If CPU % goes below 40%, remove 2 containers.</p>
<p>Within our organisation each team has their own ECS cluster and each cluster has micro service containers owned by them. We scale individual service independently depending on the traffic.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ina4ojrdmfcizwosqgx8.png" alt="product-page-diagram_ECS_1.86ebd8c223ec8b55aa1903c423fbe4e672f3daf7"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-idelasticachegreaterlessagreater-4-elasticache"><a id="elasticache"></a> 4. ElastiCache:</h3>
<p>Amazon ElastiCache works as a high throughput and low latency in-memory data store and cache to support the most demanding applications requiring sub-millisecond response times.</p>
<p>Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing.</p>
<p>Amazon ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached for your most demanding applications that require sub-millisecond response times.</p>
<p>Similar to EC2 instance types, there are multiple instance families and types available like t3, r5, m5 etc. You can use the one which you need based on your computing requirements and budget constraints.</p>
<p>In our organisation, we have a service which gets around 6000 reqs/sec and we needed low API response time from this service. So we decided use ElastiCache as the primary source of data for this micro service. The service has been able to serve requests with single digit millisecond response time without any issues.</p>
<p>Apart from this we use Redis in many other critical services as write-through, write-back cache and also to store some data which can be accessed quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/n0s5ovl9mgidg9a96xd8.png" alt="elasticache"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-ids3greaterlessagreater-5-simple-storage-service-s3"><a id="s3"></a> 5. Simple Storage Service (S3):</h3>
<p>As the name suggests S3 provides low cost object storage service with high scalability, data availability, security and performance.</p>
<p>S3 can be used to store files for many use cases like websites, mobile apps, enterprise applications, backup and restore etc.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.</p>
<p>We use S3 in various use cases like to store call recordings, invoice pdf files, payment receipts, backup older service logs, Amazon Athena to query data stored in S3 for analytics etc. We even use it for lambda trigger events.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mdzls6579so4u2b9p4jm.jpg" alt="Diagram_S3_Access_Points.fa88c474dc1073aede962aaf3a6af2d6b02be933"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-idsqsgreaterlessagreater-6-simple-queuing-service-sqs"><a id="sqs"></a> 6. Simple Queuing Service (SQS):</h3>
<p>SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale micro services independently. Using SQS you can send, store and receive messages between different components at any volume. This helps you to build highly scalable and distributed applications.</p>
<p>SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Standard queues: Standard SQS should be used when you've requirements for maximum throughput, no ordering and at-least-once delivery of messages is needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>FIFO queues: FIFO SQS should be used when order of the messages is important and they should be processed exactly once, in the same order they are sent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two important properties of SQS queues are message retention period and default visibility timeout. </p>
<p><strong>Message Retention Period:</strong> is the time for which any message pushed into the queue is retained. For example if this value is 3 days, messages will be deleted after 3 days from the queue.</p>
<p><strong>Default Visibility Timeout:</strong> once any worker / application has picks up a message, the default visibility timeout is the time only after which the message will be visible again for other workers to pick it up and process.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o1herbvj4yhv8u7pfjy9.png" alt="Diagram2"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-idload-balancergreaterlessagreater-7-load-balancer"><a id="load-balancer"></a> 7. Load Balancer:</h3>
<p>Load Balancer is a critical component of any distributed system which sits between a client and a server, accepts incoming requests, and routes them across a a cluster of servers to handle the load.</p>
<p>It keeps track of health status of all the servers connected. If a particular server is unhealthy, then it will not send incoming requests to that server.</p>
<p>Benefits of a load balancer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster user experience</li>
<li>Less downtime and high throughput. If a particular server is down, LB takes care of routing the traffic to the ones which are up.</li>
<li>Reduces individual server load and prevents any one application server from becoming a single point of failure.</li>
<li>Improves response time </li>
<li>Improves overall system availability</li>
</ul>
<p>Routing algorithms used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Least Connection Method</li>
<li>Least Response Time Method</li>
<li>Least Bandwidth Method</li>
<li>Round Robin Method</li>
<li>Weighted Round Robin Method</li>
<li>IP Hash Method</li>
</ul>
<p>We use both internet facing and internal load balancers in our services depending on whether it's a customer facing application or an internal micro service.</p>
<p>There are many other concepts that are tightly coupled with Load Balancers like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target Groups</li>
<li>Listener Rules</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not in the scope of this article. But I highly recommend reading about these.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lpypr06mji7dnjg07gqz.png" alt="alb"></p>
<h3 id="lessa-idroute53greaterlessagreater-8-route-53"><a id="route53"></a> 8. Route 53:</h3>
<p>Route53 a highly available and scalable DNS service from AWS. If you don't know what a DNS service is, it's basically the service which routes end users to Internet applications by translating names like <a href="http://www.example.com/" target="_blank">example.com</a> into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.</p>
<p>Route53 allows us to route traffic through a variety of routing types like Simple Routing, Weighted Round Robin, Latency Routing, Failover Routing, Multi Answer Routing, Geolocation etc. With different combinations of these we can build highly available fault tolerant systems.</p>
<p>There are different types of DNS records available depending on how you want to route based on DNS queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>A record type</li>
<li>AAAA record type</li>
<li>CAA record type</li>
<li>CNAME record type</li>
<li>MX record type</li>
<li>NAPTR record type</li>
<li>NS record type</li>
<li>PTR record type</li>
<li>SOA record type</li>
<li>SPF record type</li>
<li>SRV record type</li>
<li>TXT record type</li>
</ul>
<p>We use route53 in various use cases within our organisation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Route traffic from a host endpoint to an internal load balancer using CNAME record</li>
<li>Route traffic from a host endpoint to a …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>There is no right answer to what makes a great user experience as it depends entirely on user interactions and perceptions of the product. Every UX is particular to the user groups and user needs. The expertise of Figma alone, despite its robust features, will not give you an excellent user experience. Instead, an application of UX processes – a series of actions for every UX designer to take into consideration while developing user experience – and knowledge of Figma will set you on the path to creating extraordinary user experience design. These processes include (in no particular order): </p>
<ul>
<li>Creating <a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/the-benefits-of-user-personas-when-designing-the-ultimate-user-experience"><strong>user-profiles and personas</strong></a></li>
<li>User survey</li>
<li>Interface testing</li>
<li>Mockups</li>
<li>Wireframes</li>
<li>UX flow</li>
<li>Prototyping tools</li>
<li>Sitemaps</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Style guides</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Figma?</h2>
<div><p>Figma is a free (for individuals), cloud-based, vector-based, prototyping tool quite similar to Sketch in functionality. It stands out because of its flexible features, accessibility, designer-developer collaborations, pricing, and prototyping qualities.</p><p>Figma gives designers access, not just in cutting edge features, but in practical execution. Being browser-based, it eliminates the drawbacks of having to work with a particular OS or PC. There is no question of Figma for Linux, Figma for mac, or Figma for windows. As long as you have a browser, you can work with it. Its real-time frictionless collaboration between developers and designers has proved to be instrumental for cohesive and reliable design systems.</p></div>
<h2>Can beginners use Figma?</h2>
<p>Yes. Figma is relatively easy to learn and takes very little time to get up to speed with how it operates. Not just for newbies but also designers who migrate from other prototyping tools. Figma has almost every element you need on the same page. The icons are relatable and easy to identify. The features are interactive, and the design page - simple.</p>
<h3>Figma’s key features include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open Type fonts</li>
<li>Plugins that support automated tasks for repeated actions</li>
<li>Smart-selection tools</li>
<li>Styles that can immediately be applied to your project</li>
<li>Create design systems and components</li>
<li>Drag and drop accessible libraries</li>
<li>An unlimited number of collaborators at a given time</li>
<li>User permissions control</li>
<li>Live link easy-export</li>
<li>Prototype tools, optimized for mobile</li>
<li>Intuitive animation that connects objects</li>
<li>Embedded comments</li>
<li>Real-time editing with teams in shared design spaces</li>
<li>Version history tracked to see what was changed, who made the edit, and when.</li>
<li>Design systems where assets are searchable</li>
<li>Custom styles can be shared (all files are in one location)</li>
<li>Components reuse</li>
<li>One platform to design, prototype, and build</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Power of Figma as an excellent User Experience Design Tool</h2>
<div><p>Before Figma, wireframing, design, prototyping, and collaboration was a series of iterative back and forth process between the vector-based prototyping tool and other third-party apps. One would have to build wireframes in an app like Balsamiq, create the design in <strong>Sketch</strong>, then prototype in <strong>inVision</strong>. <em>Figma got rid of the extra baggage</em> by creating a platform where everything, from wireframes to prototypes, can be done on one screen.</p><p>Figma incorporates powerful features that simplify the UX creation process for designers and makes it more effective at helping designers and adjacent teams work together. Let’s take a closer look.  </p></div>
<h3>1. Components</h3>
<div><p>Components are reusable, scalable elements in the design. They are very flexible, easy to use, and help create consistent designs across multiple projects.</p><p>By allowing designers to create UI libraries—and share them with the team—anyone with access to a project can use component instances in <em>their</em> designs and rest assured that they work with the latest version.</p><p>To create a component, select the object you want to create a component in, right-click, and select ‘Create Component.’</p></div>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/figma-components.jpg" alt="Figma - Working with components">
<figcaption><small>Figma - Working with components</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The beauty of Figma’s component structure is that it has a nice layer hierarchy set in place. The master components can be edited in their respective layers, inside the particular element, keeping everything organized and situated conveniently on the same page.  </p>
<h3>2. Wireframes</h3>
<p>Wireframes are visual guides representing webpages’ skeletal framework and provide a preview of a site or app’s feel and look. Creating wireframes is usually the first step in the UX process. Wireframes are the blueprints of the final design. Figma’s wireframing makes working with designs feel approachable and intuitive. They offer wireframe templates and wireframe kits live in the browser to begin sketching without the need for any additional software. By harnessing Figma prototyping’s power, you can also bring your wireframes to life without having to code.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/figma-wireframes.jpg" alt="Figma - Wireframes">
<figcaption><small>Figma - Wireframes</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figma supports both low fidelity and high fidelity wireframing. Their templates are easy to share, and your team can leave comments right on the file. By using Figma’s wireframe, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut back on revisions</li>
<li>Get instant feedback</li>
<li>Decide the content priority</li>
<li>Test usability</li>
<li>Catch problems early</li>
<li>Get stakeholders to see what the product will look like</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Third-party developer APIs</h3>
<div><p>In 2018, Figma launched the Figma Platform to improve design workflows by connecting Figma to other tools. The web API lays the foundation for unique forms of design collaborations, allowing companies to build customs tools to meet their specific requirements. Amongst companies that have utilized this platform are Uber, Haiku, and Github. For example, to raise visibility across the organization, Uber had created a live feed of what their design team is working on.</p><p>Figma’s API also promises to fulfill customer requests for third-party plugins. These integrations are web-based and do not need any scripting language for implementation. </p></div>
<h3>4. Prototyping and interactions</h3>
<div><p>The <em>ease </em><em>of </em><em>prototyping</em> is one of the main reasons why Figma is every designer’s delight. Prototypes are simulations designed to understand the relationship between the final product interfaces and see how effective they are and how they work.</p><p>Figma’s prototype tools allow designers to create interactive flows on designs seamlessly. Figma also lets interactions on states such as hover, mouse events, and click. The prototypes and all interactions within them can be distributed to anyone with access (just like other design files) to view and provide feedback.</p><p><strong>Prototypes are a fantastic way to:</strong></p></div>
<ul>
<li>Preview interactions and user flows</li>
<li>Share and iterate on ideas</li>
<li>Get feedback from collaborators</li>
<li>Test user interactions</li>
<li>Present your designs to stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Collaborations</h3>
<div><p>One of the Figma’s strongest suits is it’s <em>real-time updating and collaborating</em> feature amongst designers, developers, and even clients. It is no wonder Figma has been called the <em>Google Docs of </em><em>D</em><em>esign</em>. Sharing options are available at different levels on the design – project level, team level, and file level. Each project-level also comes with a different set of rights. For example, only the designers can edit individual elements, while everyone else is free to review them.</p><p>Everyone viewing or editing a design has his/her avatar at the top of the page. It is easy to track other collaborators’ movements and actions, as their mouse cursor carries their name as a label.&nbsp; You can click on someone else’s avatar to see what they view or work on in real-time.</p><p>Figma tops this great feature by integrating Slack for live communication amongst collaborators. When a Figma slack channel is active, any comment, feedback, or design edits is immediately reflected on the communication channel. Changes are reviewed and vetted immediately.</p><p>The collab feature also comes in handy during remote presentations, as everyone who has access to the file can follow the viewport of the presenter, as everything they refer to can be checked right on the spot.</p></div>
<h2>The cons of Figma</h2>
<p>Although Figma packs many positive values, it still carries some downsides. One is that you have to be always online to enjoy its numerous benefits. The desktop app offers offline work mode, where your files sync once you get back within internet range. It provides no backup in case of a system crash or unexpected incident, and you can only work on files already uploaded to the cloud. The offline mode poses some limitations on some of the valuable features.</p>
<p>Figma also offers little privacy as team members can see each other’s work. Someone could even be spying on you while you do some work on the shared files. If you are a designer/developer who prefers to work within their customized privacy, get ready to abandon that factor when using Figma.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Figma is an intuitive and innovative tool with the intent to take on the entire design process. It offers enormous benefits to both individuals and teams. Figma’s ingenuity shows in its utilization of accessibility to the web while delivering the same features expected of a native app. It offers enough flexibility to iterate and produce deliverables. It also generates its own CSS code on elements that developers can later use to build on top of that. <em><strong>The benefits of using Figma for user experience design outweigh the cons.</strong></em></p>

September 24, 2020 | https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Haskell/Vedanta | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Haskell/Vedanta">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">
<p>
A program is precise specification of a process, detailed-enough to be executed by an abstract machine.
</p>
<p>
An algorithm is a formalized (well-defined and precise) general procedure (a sequence of actions to perform), to be implemented in all sufficient and necessary details.
</p>
<h2 id="Haskell">Haskell</h2>
<p>
Haskell is pure Logic. Strongly-typed with type-classes and highly syntactically sugared, which is compiled to a intermediate language (MIR) which is also a language based on a <em>Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus</em>, which, in turn, is <em>evaluated by runtime as a type-checked state machine</em> - this is what the function <code>main</code> produces (which is what a Haskell executable really is).
</p>
<p>
Not just that, all Haskell code, including MIR, could be evaluated by pure substitution -- by applying rewrite rules, (beta-reduction, inlining, etc.) exactly like Logic and Math, which, look at this:
</p>
<p>
<em>makes Haskell a pure high-order predicate logic, statically typed with type-classes, reducible to pure Lambda Calculus (as its implementation)</em>.
</p>
<p>
C++ is a joke compared to this and NodeJS is just bullshit.
</p>
<h2 id="Purity">Purity</h2>
<p>
All Haskell expressions are pure, even when they describe impure actions to be performed eventually by mundane impure runtime.
</p>
<p>
The expression produced by the main function is a pure definition of a state-machine (an actual structure!) verified to be type-safe (have no contradictions) by the compiler.
</p>
<p>
Each function is pure because the <em>context</em> (or state) is always passed to it as a parameter, even <em>The Whole World</em> is passed in the case of IO (implementation, however, throws it away!).
</p>
<p>
From the mathematical point of view if you have the whole world as a parameter to a function which returns a value <em>together with a new version of the world, after causing some effect on it</em>, then, the function is indeed pure. <em>Same input - same output. Always</em>.
</p>
<p>
This is not a joke. Not just a beautiful metaphor. As long as all functions are pure <em>the substitution model of evaluation (as in Lambda Calculus, Logic and Mathematics) still holds</em>, so Haskell is still a pure higher-order logic - <em>Simply Typed Lambda Calculus extended with some additional evaluation rules, type-classes and decorated with some syntactic sugar</em>. Its MIT is exactly this.
</p>
<p>
One more time: Haskell code is <em>a Pure Logic</em>, not just theoretically but technically and operationally.
</p>
<p>
It all can, in principle, be evaluated with pen and pencil using substitution. Just like Maths.
</p>
<h2 id="Monads">Monads</h2>
<p>
Haskell literally separates a pure functional code from impure by  creating <em>an abstraction barrier</em> between pure and impure code by encapsulation such code into various <a href="https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Haskell/Monads">Monads</a>.
</p>
<p>
Separation (an abstraction barrier) is enforced at a type level.
Functions below cannot access values (and functions) above.
</p>
<p>
The <em>contexts</em> could play very different roles, from holding algebraic data types, such as <code>Either</code> or <code>Maybe</code>, to encapsulations <code>State</code> and <code>IO</code>.
</p>
<p>
Being composed (which is what it is all about) Monads provide an implicit sequencing for a pure, lazy code, via <a href="https://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/FirstPrinciples/Nesting">nesting</a> of functions -- <code>(.)</code> and <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> are merely nested lambdas.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Monads are fit to encapsulate <code>IO</code> actions which imply serialization (sequencing).
</p>
<p>
End of the long and messy story.
</p>
<h2 id="Endofknowledge.">End of knowledge.</h2>
<p>
Technically, Haskell is a pure-functional language with lazy semantics  which is statically (and, obviously, strongly) typed with type-classes. It is simplified into an intermediate language (representation), which is just <em>Simple-Typed Lambda Calculus extended with a few additional types, syntactic forms and evaluation rules</em>. Even more technically, it uses <em>System F Omega formalism</em> to implement High-order Logic.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600871234687/et6yX6Wlb.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Software development is hard. Time zones are hard. Dealing with time zones in software development?  Yeah, <strong>harder</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>4</strong> places where time zones might differ; and 4 personal bug stories for each case. I'll be referring to the same app for each story, the one I work with and maintain in my day-to-day job. This app works with Mexico's City time zone.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-app">Time zone of your app</h2>
<p>Your app runs with a default time zone. It's usually the time zone of the server it runs on, but it can be different.</p>
<p>In Java, you can define the time zone of the whole application when it boots. If for some reason you don't want to work with your server's timezone, this is the place to change it.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-time-in-chile-off-by-one-hour">The bug - Time in Chile off by one hour</h3>
<p>The app shows the date of creation of an object in many places. Three of these places were showing different times; <strong>two incorrect and one correct</strong>.</p>
<p>One error was because I forgot to pass the user's timezone to the date formatter. Quick fix.</p>
<p>The second error was weird. I couldn't identify why, so I compared it with the correct one.</p>
<p>But the third case was only right because the date had been double parsed! Once on the server and a second time on the client (browser).</p>
<p>So none of the three dates were actually correct. <strong>WTF?</strong></p>
<p>After some headaches, I learned that each version of Java comes with a time zone data file. This file includes the latest information on the world's time zones, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</a> manages it. </p>
<p>Time zone changes happen when governments decide to apply or not to apply daylight saving times (DST). </p>
<p>In 2015, Chile decided to move from seasonal DST to permanent DST, and some JRE releases included this change. But then, in 2016 Chile decided to revert to how it was before; seasonal DST instead of permanent. <strong>What was the issue?</strong> The app was using one of these JRE releases with an outdated time zone data file.</p>
<p>You can read more about these <a target="_blank" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0622033">DST issues with Java here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-server">Time zone of your server</h2>
<p>The operative system defines your server's time zone. I've always used Linux for production servers, and they come with UTC as the default time zone.</p>
<p>If you need to change this time zone, make sure to do it before your application starts or it won't reflect the change.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-app-using-the-wrong-default-time-zone-from-the-server">The bug - App using the wrong default time zone from the server</h3>
<p>I was migrating some processes in our build and deployment pipeline. From configuring the app with every deploy to a pre-built AWS Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with HashiCorp's Packer.</p>
<p>One step of the initial configuration was to change the server's time zone to America/Mexico_City, and I was aware of it. So I created a bash script that changed the time zone on the AMI we were going to use. The script worked well when I tested it on a Linux instance. No problem there.</p>
<p>I proceeded to use this AMI in our staging environment and neither I nor my teammates noticed something off. So, to production!</p>
<p>Customer's questions and complaints about dates behaving weird arrived minutes later 😥</p>
<p><strong>The issue?</strong> The script that updated the server's time zone was failing silently and I missed double-checking it in the staging environment. The app wasn't using an explicit time zone, so it took the server's. And the server's time zone was UTC by default, and we needed America/Mexico_City. I fixed the script and, to make sure, updated the app's default time zone to the expected one.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-database">Time zone of your database</h2>
<p>You can also change your database's time zone. I use AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) and the default time zone is UTC. You can update it from the parameter group of your cluster or individual instance.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-wrong-database-time-zone">The bug - Wrong database time zone</h3>
<p>Now I was doing a migration of our database. I anticipated myself by changing the database's time zone to America/Mexico_City because the app and server had it. Every part of the system should be in the same page, right? <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>
<p>The database was perfectly okay being in UTC while the app and server were in America/Mexico_City. That's how it worked. </p>
<p>This bug was not as critical as the previous ones because I caught it in our staging environment. </p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-users">Time zone of your users</h2>
<p>If it wasn't enough, each one of your users can have a different time zone, and you have to take that into consideration when showing time sensitive-data.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-many-of-them">The bug - Many of them!</h3>
<p>I've encountered many bugs related to user's time zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing time zone in date formatter.</li>
<li>Incorrect time zone selection from the user.</li>
<li>Missing DST time zone options for users to select.</li>
<li>Storing dates with time zone modifications that get parsed again when retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Time zones are one of the most complicated topics you'll find while developing software. They're complex by themselves, and even more when you throw some code into the mix.</p>
<p>I hope these short stories can help you avoid my mistakes in the future 🙌🏼</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading me! 💙</strong></p>

<h4>Tufts University has released results of a study linking eating avocados to helping improve cognitive brain function</h4>
<p>The study reveals an link to “eating avocados to helping improve cognitive brain function in older adults, news especially relevant to Hispanics who have been found to have the longest life expectancy rate in the U.S. Published in the journal Nutrients and supported by the USDA and the Hass Avocado Board, the research tracked how 40 healthy adults ages 50 and over who ate one fresh avocado a day for six months experienced a 25 percent increase in lutein levels in their eyes and significantly improved working memory and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>Lutein is a type of carotenoid antioxidant, or pigment, commonly found in fruits and vegetables already widely accepted to have a role in preserving eye health and now increasingly thought to have a positive impact on brain health as well. As study participants incorporated one medium avocado into their daily diet, researchers monitored gradual growth in the amount of lutein in their eyes and progressive improvement in cognition skills as measured by tests designed to evaluate memory, processing speed and attention levels. In contrast, the control group, which did not eat avocados, experienced fewer improvements in cognitive health during the study period.</p>
<p>“The results of this study suggest that the monounsaturated fats, fiber, lutein and other bioactives make avocados particularly effective at enriching neural lutein levels, which may provide benefits for not only eye health, but for brain health,” said Elizabeth Johnson, lead investigator of the study from the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. “Furthermore, the results of this new research reveal that macular pigment density more than doubled in subjects that consumed fresh avocados, compared to a supplement, as evidenced by my previous published research. Thus, a balanced diet that includes fresh avocados may be an effective strategy for cognitive health.”</p>
<p>“Tuft’s findings that eating avocados is linked to a positive impact on memory is one more reason to enjoy healthy avocados daily. It’s especially good news for Hispanic households where avocados are already so popular and older generations are culturally central to the core family unit,” said Emiliano Escobedo, executive director of the Hass Avocado Board. “More research is needed in different populations with different amounts of avocado to better understand the connection between avocados and brain health.”</p>

September 24, 2020 | https://staffeng.com/guides/deciding-to-switch | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staffeng.com/guides/deciding-to-switch">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h4><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Guides</a> / <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/deciding-to-switch">Deciding to switch companies</a></h4><div><p>My father was a professor of economics. After he completed his PhD in his late twenties, he started teaching at one university, got tenure at that university, and walked out forty-some years later into retirement. Working in technology, that sounds like a fairytale.</p>
<p>There are very few software companies with a forty-year track record, and even fewer folks whose <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">forty-year career</a> consisted of one employer. There used to be a meme that many engineers spent either one or four years at each company to maximize their equity grants and then bounced on to the next. If that ever happened, it certainly isn’t common behavior for folks who aspire towards or reach Staff-plus roles.</p>
<p>Instead, generally those folks stay, and are rewarded for staying, at a given company as long as the circumstances support their success. If those circumstances change, they tend to either leave shortly thereafter or spend a while burning out and then leave after exhausting their emotional reservoir.</p>
<p>It takes years to build the visibility and social credibility to get promoted from a Senior Engineer role to a Staff-plus role, which makes it very difficult to walk away if you feel like you’re <em>just</em> one hump away from the promotion. Leaving, it can feel like, means starting over from scratch.</p>
<p>Then again, as described by <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/duretti-hirpa">Duretti Hirpa</a> and <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/keavy-mcminn">Keavy McMinn</a>, it’s common for folks to attain their first Staff-plus title by joining a new company. Even with all your internal credibility, sometimes leaving is the most effective path forward.</p>
<p>What’s the right decision for you?</p>
<hr>
<p>Before going further, I want to recognize two very different job-switching experiences: one of privileged flexibility and another of rigid constraints. Your residency might depend on a work-sponsored visa. You might be supporting an extended family. You might be constrained to a geographical area with few employers. This advice focuses on the former circumstances, which are more common circumstances for someone who’s deep enough into a technology career to pursue a Staff role. You should absolutely discount it to the extent this doesn’t reflect your circumstances.</p>
<h2>Why leaving works</h2>
<p>The company that knows your strengths the best is your current company, and they are the company most likely to give you a Staff-plus role. However, actually awarding the role depends on so many circumstantial concerns, that this isn’t how it works out in practice.</p>
<p>If your current team is very senior, it may be hard to justify your impact at the Staff engineer level because it’s being attributed to your peers. Your manager might have a limited budget that doesn’t have room for another Staff engineer. You might lack an internal sponsor. There simply might not be the need for an additional Staff engineer at your company. Any of these can mean that while you ought to be promoted, your current company won’t.</p>
<p>Conversely, when you interview for new roles, you can simply keep interviewing until you find a company that’s able to grant the title. The interview process often brings an automatic sponsor with it -- the hiring manager -- whose incentives will never be more aligned with yours than in the interview process.</p>
<p>The technical interviews are an inconsistent and unreliable predictor of success, which is bad for the industry and bad for companies, but works in your favor if you’re set on attaining a Staff-plus role and are willing to conduct a broad search. Interviewing creates the opportunity to play “bias arbitrage”, finding a company that values your particular brand of bullshit disproportionately. That might be a company that values folks with conference speaking visibility, your experience designing APIs, or <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/dmitry-petrashko">your PhD thesis on compilers</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes you’ll get into a rut at a company where your reputation is preventing forward progress. Perhaps you’ve tagged “difficult” after flagging inclusion issues. Maybe you embarrassed an influential Director at lunch and they’re blocking your promotion. A new company lets you leave that baggage behind.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yeah, of course, it’s always an open question whether you can <em>really</em> leave anything behind you in the tech industry. It can feel a bit cliquey at times. If you’ve worked in tech hubs, at larger companies, and for more than ten years, then you almost certainly have mutual connections with the folks interviewing you.</p>
<p>If you have a bad run at a company, maybe your manager was a bully or maybe you were going through a challenging period in your own life, it can feel like a cloud poisoning your future prospects. That said, much like the interview process in general, references and backchannel reference checks are deeply random. If you need any further evidence of that, look to the serial harassers who continue to get hired job after job at prominent companies.</p>
<h2>Things to try before leaving</h2>
<p>If you’re planning to leave due to lack of interest, excitement, support or opportunity, it’s worthwhile to at least explore the internal waters first. This lets you carry your internal network with you while still getting many of the advantages of switching companies. Depending on your company’s size and growth rate this might not be an option for you, but there are some folks who switch roles every two-to-three years within the same parent company, and find that an effective way to remain engaged and learning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re considering leaving due to burnout or exhaustion, it’s sometimes possible to negotiate a paid or unpaid sabbatical where you can take a few months recharging yourself, often in conjunction with switching internal roles. This is more common at larger companies. (In case you were wondering, no your coworkers taking parental leave is not “on sabbatical” or “on vacation.”)</p>
<h2>Leaving without a job</h2>
<p>Speaking of burnout, if you’re <em>particularly</em> burned out, it’s worth considering leaving your job without another job lined up. There’s a fairly simple checklist to determine if this is a good option for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your visa support this?</li>
<li>Are you financially secure for at least a year without working?</li>
<li>Do you work in a high-density job market, remotely, or are you flexible on where your next job is?</li>
<li>Do you interview well?</li>
<li>Could you articulate a coherent narrative to someone asking you why you left without a job lined up?</li>
<li>Are there folks at your previous company who can provide positive references?</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of those are true, then I don’t know anyone who <em>regrets</em> taking a sabbatical. However, bear in mind that it’s only the folks who took six-month-plus sabbaticals who felt reborn by the experience. Folks taking shorter stints have appreciated them but often come back only partially restored.</p>
<h2>Taking the plunge</h2>
<p>If you’re almost at the Staff promotion in your current company, there is absolutely another company out there who will give you the Staff title. Whether or not you’ll enjoy working there or be supported after getting there, that’s a lot harder to predetermine. If your internal reputation is damaged or if you’ve been repeatedly on the cusp of promotion but victim to a moving criteria line, then you should seriously consider switching roles if the title is important to you -- at some point you have to hear what your current company is telling you.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you’re happy in your current role outside of the title, consider if you can be more intentional about pursuing your promotion rather than leaving. Many folks hit a rut in their promotion path to Staff-plus, and using techniques like the <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> can help you get unstuck. If you’ve used all the approaches, taken your self-development seriously, and still can’t get there -- it’s probably time to change.</p>
<p>That said, it’s easy to overthink these things. Few folks tell their decade-past story of staying at or leaving some job.</p></div><p><em><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Read another guide?</a></em> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <em><a href="https://staffeng.com/stories">Back to the stories?</a></em></p></section></div></div>]]>

September 24, 2020 | https://amitness.com/interactive-sentence-embeddings/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/interactive-sentence-embeddings/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">Embedding Projector</a> is a free web application for visualizing high-dimensional data. It has built-in demos for visualizing word embeddings in NLP and image embeddings for MNIST in Computer Vision.</p>
<p>I recently experimented with a way to load sentence embeddings along with the class labels into this tool and explore them interactively. In this blog post, I will explain the end-to-end process with an example dataset.</p>
<h2 id="toy-example-outlier-detection">Toy Example: Outlier Detection</h2>
<h3 id="1-preparing-dataset">1. Preparing Dataset</h3>
<p>To understand this use case, let’s take a subset of 100 movie reviews from the SST-2 dataset which are labeled as positive and negative.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

<span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'http://bit.ly/dataset-sst2'</span><span>,</span> 
                 <span>nrows</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>names</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'text'</span><span>,</span> <span>'label'</span><span>])</span>

<span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'label'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'label'</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>({</span><span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>'negative'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>'positive'</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The dataset has a column containing the text and a label indicating whether it’s positive or negative opinion.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-head-5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We will introduce label noise into our dataset by corrupting five of the responses with random text. It will act as an outlier for our example.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>loc</span><span>[[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>27</span><span>,</span> <span>54</span><span>,</span> <span>72</span><span>,</span> <span>91</span><span>],</span> <span>'text'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'askgkn askngk kagkasng'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="2-generating-embeddings">2. Generating Embeddings</h3>
<p>Now, we will compute sentence embeddings for the headlines using the <code>sentence-transformers</code> package. First, let’s install it using pip.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>!</span>pip <span>install </span>sentence-transformers
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we will create a helper function to return a NumPy array of sentence embeddings given a list of sentences.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>sentence_transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>SentenceTransformer</span>

<span>sentence_bert_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>SentenceTransformer</span><span>(</span><span>'distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_embeddings</span><span>(</span><span>sentences</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sentence_bert_model</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(</span><span>sentences</span><span>,</span>
                                    <span>batch_size</span><span>=</span><span>32</span><span>,</span> 
                                    <span>show_progress_bar</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Using the above function, we can generate sentence embeddings for our data as shown below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_embeddings</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'text'</span><span>])</span>
<span># shape: (100, 768)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="3-exporting-to-embedding-projector-format">3. Exporting to Embedding Projector Format</h3>
<p>Embedding Projector requires two TSV files to load our custom embeddings.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>output.tsv</code>: This file should contain the embeddings without any headers.</li>
<li><code>metadata.tsv</code>: This file should contain the original text and labels for the embeddings</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s first generate the <code>output.tsv</code> file for our sentence embeddings from the previous step.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Convert NumPy array of embedding into data frame
</span><span>embedding_df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span>

<span># Save dataframe as as TSV file without any index and header
</span><span>embedding_df</span><span>.</span><span>to_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'output.tsv'</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>header</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To generate <code>metadata.csv</code>, we simply save our original dataframe.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Save dataframe without any index
</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>to_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'metadata.tsv'</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="4-importing-into-embedding-projector">4. Importing into Embedding Projector</h3>
<p>We first go to <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">https://projector.tensorflow.org/</a>.</p>
<p>On the left-hand sidebar, click the <strong>Load</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-load-step-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, for the first <strong>Choose file</strong> button, upload the <code>output.tsv</code> file and for the second <strong>Choose file</strong> button, upload the <code>metadata.tsv</code> file.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-load-step-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After uploading both files, click outside and you should see the sentence embedding projection. The dimensions of embeddings are reduced to 3D by default using PCA.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-3d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s switch to 2D by turning off the checkbox for ‘Component #3’ in the bottom part of sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-turn-off-3d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the 2D visualization, we can see how the random text is far from other groups of text as an <strong>outlier</strong>. On hovering the point, we see the text <code>askgkn askngk kagkasng</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-outlier.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="5-useful-features-in-projector">5. Useful Features in Projector</h3>
<h4 id="a-class-separation">a. Class Separation</h4>
<p>We can enable color coding of the points by their actual labels (positive vs negative) by using the <strong>Color by</strong> dropdown in the left sidebar.</p>
<p>Select the name of the column that contains your labels. In our example file, the column name is <strong>label</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-color-code-labels.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The points themselves are interactive. You can see the actual sentence for each point by hovering over them.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-interactive-1.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>You can click on the point to show the metadata. We can see below on clicking a blue point that its label is “positive” in the popup.</p>
<p>So the blue points are positive and the red points are negative. When a point is selected, 100 nearest points in terms of cosine similarity are also highlighted.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-click-point.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>To get back to the original view, we can click on any empty white space.</p>
<div>
<h4>Applications</h4>
<p>The color coding can be a useful heuristic for many use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be used to explore class overlap for the dataset you're working on and identify tricky sentences.</li>
<li>If there are labeling errors in your dataset, then this might help uncover them. For example, if a whole cluster of points is in a certain color, but some single point in that cluster is in a different color, then that might be an outlier or labeling error.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="b-dimensionality-reduction-algorithm">b. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm</h4>
<p>The web app provides three standard dimensionality reduction techniques: <strong>UMAP</strong>, <strong>T-SNE</strong>, and <strong>PCA</strong>.</p>
<p>You can choose the algorithm and their parameters from the bottom of the left sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-choose-dim-algorithm.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="c-custom-linear-projection">c. Custom Linear Projection</h4>
<p>You can also use a custom keyword or full text as the axis using the <strong>CUSTOM</strong> tab. This will apply a custom linear projection and can help us explore meaningful directions in the embedding space.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-custom-dim.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the Gmail team tried setting “yeah” on the left side and “yes” on the right side. When they projected encoder embeddings for email replies to this custom linear projection, they found replies in a casual tone (e.g. Here you go) on the left side and responses in a more formal tone clustered towards the right side.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/projector-custom-direction.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, Embedding Projector is a very useful tool to better understand the datasets and models we work with.</p>

<![CDATA[How Iranian diaspora is using old-school tech to fight internet shutdown at home]]>
            </title>

<![CDATA[

<br/>
September 24, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/cat-and-mouse-censorship/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/cat-and-mouse-censorship/">archive.org</a>

<p>One November morning last year, Mehdi Yahyanejad listened to a voicemail in his Los Angeles office: “I’m contacting you from the city of Tehran,” said the voice. “This was the first time I’ve experienced an internet shutdown. … It feels like I’m in a prison.”</p>



<p>A few weeks earlier, Iran’s largest mobile networks and internet providers went offline. Amid weeks of growing anti-regime protests, Iranian authorities imposed <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/18/middleeast/iran-protests-explained-intl/index.html">the longest internet shutdown</a> in the country’s history, effectively cutting off external communication for over 80 million Iranians. In an unprecedented crackdown, regime forces <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/05/iran-details-released-of-304-deaths-during-protests-six-months-after-security-forces-killing-spree/">killed more than 300 protesters</a> and arrested <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/12/iran-thousands-arbitrarily-detained-and-at-risk-of-torture-in-chilling-post-protest-crackdown/">over 7,000 people</a>. When access was finally restored on November 23, nearly half the country was still unable to come online.</p>



<p>Nine months after the November blackout, Iranians still live in fear of another all-out shutdown. As authorities tighten their hold on internet access, diaspora-led companies are filling the gap for Iranians who are seeking a way to bypass censors. The circumvention tools, created largely by diaspora entrepreneurs, are becoming increasingly critical as they face a crackdown at home and the bite of American-led sanctions online.</p>



<p>On November 15, as Iranian authorities first moved to induce the digital blackout, 44-year-old Yahyanejad raced against the clock in Los Angeles to make sure that people back home had downloaded his satellite file-casting application <a href="https://www.toosheh.org/">Toosheh</a>.<em> </em>“It was a very small window,” says Yahyanejad. “Once they were fully disconnected, I wasn’t sure they’d be able to download the software.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched by Yahyanejad in 2016, the technology aggregates uncensored content, like news articles, YouTube videos, and podcasts, and sends it to Iranian homes directly via satellite TV. When Yahyanejad first began developing Toosheh in 2013, an estimated 70% of Iranian households owned a satellite dish, while around 20% had access to the internet. Even as internet access has grown, state censorship means Toosheh’s satellite technology is a much more reliable source for uncensored content. Iranians can install Toosheh’s satellite channel and receive a daily dispatch in the form of a file package of up to 8 gigabytes. Once a user downloads the app, the satellite transfers circumvent the internet entirely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanejad says Toosheh gained nearly 100,000 new Iranian users in November 2019. In the absence of an internet connection, it became the only way for many users to access news from the outside world. The voice on Toosheh’s voicemail belonged to one such user, a 34-year-old high school principal in Tehran who downloaded emergency VPN and proxy tools delivered to him through the satellite service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having navigated extensive cyber censorship for over a decade, Iranians are tech savvy and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-42612546">adept at nimbly crossing firewalls</a>, using proxies and foreign circumvention tools. “It’s a constant cat-and-mouse game,” says Fereidoon Bashar, executive director of ASL19, a Canadian organization working to help Iranians bypass internet censorship. The group often works in tandem with Yahyanejad to distribute proxy tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bashar says Iranians adapt quickly to ever-changing institutionalized control online. But the last five years of Iranian president Hassan Rouhani’s rule have seen <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/irans-president-plans-to-cut-countrys-internet-off-from-the-rest-of-the-world/">a tighter grip on internet connections</a>. Site blocking and calculated internet outages have become easier to enforce: the regime has reduced Iran’s dependence on global networks by pushing a local intranet, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendly-domestic-internet/">aim to keep online traffic</a> inside the country. With strict American sanctions that threaten hefty fines for companies interfacing with Iran, foreign tech companies limit ordinary Iranians’ ability to purchase reliable proxies <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendly-domestic-internet/">out of an abundance of caution</a>. Riddled with insecurity, the local VPN black market is not a reliable option for those trying to avoid government attention.</p>



<p>But even as internet access grew incrementally difficult over the years, no one saw the November blackout coming. “An internet shutdown was previously viewed as a kind of dystopian political campaign,” says Kaveh Azarhoosh, an internet policy researcher. In November, the worst-case scenario for Iran’s censorship suddenly became a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early days of the protest, Toosheh created a special “Protest News Package.” Every night, after aggregating content from over 200 publications, Toosheh delivered digital bundles containing clips of protests occuring in different cities: Tabriz, Qom, Shiraz, Mashhad, and others. It also contained slides about how to stay safe during a protest; crucial news coverage from banned sites, like the <em>New York Times</em>, Voice of America Persian, and Deutsche Welle; and a curated compilation of tweets from Iranian politicians. These packages weren’t just bringing news of the outside world to Iran: they kept Iranians informed about what was happening inside their own country too.</p>



<p>Yahyanejad, a physicist by training, left Iran in 1997 to pursue a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I’ve lived in Iran, and I’ve gone to school and college there,” he explains. “I know that this repressive government exists because they are able to control the flow of information.” He says he’s always had an interest in limiting their control. “I want,” he says, “to see democracy in Iran in my lifetime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2006, Yahyanejad launched a Reddit-like forum called <a href="https://www.balatarin.com/">Balatarin</a>. “Its popularity surprised me,” he says. The site posted a translated rumor about the supreme leader’s death, after he hadn’t been seen in public for two months, and was swiftly blocked by Iran shortly after. The moment was a turning point for Yahyanejad, who says, “I made a conscious decision to keep the platform open at a personal cost.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Iranian blocks on Balatarin inspired Yahyanejad to explore censorship circumvention. He launched the satellite app Toosheh in 2016. “I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWfwF8Gx6VA">went on BBC Persian’s ‘Newshour</a>,’ and as soon as I talked about it, people started downloading and testing it immediately,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanjad finds himself among a cohort of diaspora Iranians working to fight the regime’s censors. ASL19, the Canadian technology group, collaborated with him to deliver proxy tools to over half a million Iranians during November’s shutdown. ASL19’s Bashar, who left Iran in the early 2000s before <a href="https://opennet.net/blog/2013/02/after-green-movement-internet-controls-iran-2009-2012">the tumultuous Green Movement</a>, says diaspora Iranians are stepping into the field because Iranians “risk harsh conditions, imprisonment, and long sentences” if they’re caught creating circumvention tools inside the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even outside of Iran, outspoken diaspora activists like Bashar and Yahyanejad face immense risks. In June, it was reported that an Iranian activist named Ruhollah Zam was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53238000">sentenced to death </a>in Iran after creating a popular anti-government Telegram news channel that he operated while living in exile in France. The channel, with 1.4 million followers, was shut down shortly after. For Yahyanejad, who knew of Ruhollah through the diaspora community, the ordeal was a shot across the bow. “I can never go back to Iran,” Yahyanejad admits. “But I see myself as part of the movement.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanejad’s work has become crucial for Iranians, even after November’s shutdown. On July 14, following news that Iran’s Supreme Court had upheld the death sentences of three young anti-regime protesters, Iranians took to banned social media sites in an unprecedented protest, with over 6 million posts under the hashtag #DontExecute. Hours after #DontExecute began trending online, digital rights organization NetBlocks <a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1283106806332620801?s=20">monitored disruptions in the network</a>. Panicked users, still reeling from November’s shutdown, speculated another block was imminent. Luckily, an all-out ban didn’t occur, but the renewed threat of one was enough to increase Toosheh’s usage by more than 50% in the days that followed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Yahyanejad, who has been actively fighting the Iranian regime’s censorship for over a decade, the past year is proof that his work is even more necessary. “Internet shutdowns are psychological tools designed to terrify populations, to convince them that they are voiceless,” he says. “Fighting shutdowns is important so that you can show people that they are not alone and that there are others.”</p>

<h3 id="policy-gradient">Policy Gradient</h3>

<p>The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal behavior strategy for the agent to obtain optimal rewards. The <strong>policy gradient</strong> methods target at modeling and optimizing the policy directly. The policy is usually modeled with a parameterized function respect to \(\theta\), \(\pi_\theta(a \vert s)\). The value of the reward (objective) function depends on this policy and then various algorithms can be applied to optimize \(\theta\) for the best reward.</p>

<p>The reward function is defined as:</p><p>

\[J(\theta) 
= \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} d^\pi(s) V^\pi(s) 
= \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} d^\pi(s) \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi_\theta(a \vert s) Q^\pi(s, a)\]

</p><p>where \(d^\pi(s)\) is the stationary distribution of Markov chain for \(\pi_\theta\) (on-policy state distribution under \(\pi\)). For simplicity, the parameter \(\theta\) would be omitted for the policy \(\pi_\theta\) when the policy is present in the subscript of other functions; for example, \(d^{\pi}\) and \(Q^\pi\) should be \(d^{\pi_\theta}\) and \(Q^{\pi_\theta}\) if written in full.</p>

<p>Imagine that you can travel along the Markov chain’s states forever, and eventually, as the time progresses, the probability of you ending up with one state becomes unchanged — this is the stationary probability for \(\pi_\theta\). \(d^\pi(s) = \lim_{t \to \infty} P(s_t = s \vert s_0, \pi_\theta)\) is the probability that \(s_t=s\) when starting from \(s_0\) and following policy \(\pi_\theta\) for t steps. Actually, the existence of the stationary distribution of Markov chain is one main reason for why PageRank algorithm works. If you want to read more, check <a href="https://jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/">this</a>.</p>

<p>It is natural to expect policy-based methods are more useful in the continuous space. Because there is an infinite number of actions and (or) states to estimate the values for and hence value-based approaches are way too expensive computationally in the continuous space. For example, in <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html#policy-iteration">generalized policy iteration</a>, the policy improvement step \(\arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q^\pi(s, a)\) requires a full scan of the action space, suffering from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>.</p>

<p>Using <em>gradient ascent</em>, we can move \(\theta\) toward the direction suggested by the gradient \(\nabla_\theta J(\theta)\) to find the best \(\theta\) for \(\pi_\theta\) that produces the highest return.</p>

<h3 id="policy-gradient-theorem">Policy Gradient Theorem</h3>

<p>Computing the gradient \(\nabla_\theta J(\theta)\) is tricky because it depends on both the action selection (directly determined by \(\pi_\theta\)) and the stationary distribution of states following the target selection behavior (indirectly determined by \(\pi_\theta\)). Given that the environment is generally unknown, it is difficult to estimate the effect on the state distribution by a policy update.</p>

<p>Luckily, the <strong>policy gradient theorem</strong> comes to save the world! Woohoo! It provides a nice reformation of the derivative of the objective function to not involve the derivative of the state distribution \(d^\pi(.)\) and simplify the gradient computation \(\nabla_\theta J(\theta)\) a lot.</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) 
&amp;= \nabla_\theta \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} d^\pi(s) \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q^\pi(s, a) \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \\
&amp;\propto \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} d^\pi(s) \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q^\pi(s, a) \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s) 
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="proof-of-policy-gradient-theorem">Proof of Policy Gradient Theorem</h3>

<p>This session is pretty dense, as it is the time for us to go through the proof (<a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">Sutton &amp; Barto, 2017</a>; Sec. 13.1) and figure out why the policy gradient theorem is correct.</p>

<p>We first start with the derivative of the state value function:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
&amp; \nabla_\theta V^\pi(s) \\
=&amp; \nabla_\theta \Big(\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a) \Big) &amp; \\
=&amp; \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \Big( \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a) + \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \color{red}{\nabla_\theta Q^\pi(s, a)} \Big) &amp; \scriptstyle{\text{; Derivative product rule.}} \\
=&amp; \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \Big( \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a) + \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \color{red}{\nabla_\theta \sum_{s', r} P(s',r \vert s,a)(r + V^\pi(s'))} \Big) &amp; \scriptstyle{\text{; Extend } Q^\pi \text{ with future state value.}} \\
=&amp; \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \Big( \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a) + \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \color{red}{\sum_{s', r} P(s',r \vert s,a) \nabla_\theta V^\pi(s')} \Big) &amp; \scriptstyle{P(s',r \vert s,a) \text{ or } r \text{ is not a func of }\theta}\\
=&amp; \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \Big( \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a) + \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \color{red}{\sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s,a) \nabla_\theta V^\pi(s')} \Big) &amp; \scriptstyle{\text{; Because }  P(s' \vert s, a) = \sum_r P(s', r \vert s, a)}
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Now we have:</p><p>

\[\color{red}{\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s)} 
= \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \Big( \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a) + \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s,a) \color{red}{\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s')} \Big)\]

</p><p>This equation has a nice recursive form (see the red parts!) and the future state value function \(V^\pi(s')\) can be repeated unrolled by following the same equation.</p>

<p>Let’s consider the following visitation sequence and label the probability of transitioning from state s to state x with policy \(\pi_\theta\) after k step as \(\rho^\pi(s \to x, k)\).</p><p>

\[s \xrightarrow[]{a \sim \pi_\theta(.\vert s)} s' \xrightarrow[]{a \sim \pi_\theta(.\vert s')} s'' \xrightarrow[]{a \sim \pi_\theta(.\vert s'')} \dots\]

</p><ul>
  <li>When k = 0: \(\rho^\pi(s \to s, k=0) = 1\).</li>
  <li>When k = 1, we scan through all possible actions and sum up the transition probabilities to the target state: \(\rho^\pi(s \to s', k=1) = \sum_a \pi_\theta(a \vert s) P(s' \vert s, a)\).</li>
  <li>Imagine that the goal is to go from state s to x after k+1 steps while following policy \(\pi_\theta\). We can first travel from s to a middle point s’ (any state can be a middle point, \(s' \in \mathcal{S}\)) after k steps and then go to the final state x during the last step. In this way, we are able to update the visitation probability recursively: \(\rho^\pi(s \to x, k+1) = \sum_{s'} \rho^\pi(s \to s', k) \rho^\pi(s' \to x, 1)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we go back to unroll the recursive representation of \(\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s)\)! Let \(\phi(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \nabla_\theta \pi_\theta(a \vert s)Q^\pi(s, a)\) to simplify the maths. If we keep on extending \(\nabla_\theta V^\pi(.)\) infinitely, it is easy to find out that we can transition from the starting state s to any state after any number of steps in this unrolling process and by summing up all the visitation probabilities, we get \(\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s)\)!</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
&amp; \color{red}{\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s)} \\
=&amp; \phi(s) + \sum_a \pi_\theta(a \vert s) \sum_{s'} P(s' \vert s,a) \color{red}{\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s')} \\
=&amp; \phi(s) + \sum_{s'} \sum_a \pi_\theta(a \vert s) P(s' \vert s,a) \color{red}{\nabla_\theta V^\pi(s')} \\
=&amp; \phi(s) + \sum_{s'} \rho^\pi(s \to s', 1) …</p></div></div>

DevOps encourages the maximum possibility of automation by using DevOps tools and scripts.</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c5e626f97ee281871_devops.png"></p></figure><p>Dev and Ops in the software development lifecycle</p><p>Amazon brings the slogan ‘You build it, you run it’ which aims to bring a product from development to production and cut time-to-market by anywhere from 10-15 days.</p><h3>Version Management with GitFlow</h3><p>For the source code of the application, rather than using a monolithic repository, I recommend using one repository by each microservice. The management of the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">GitFlow workflow</a> would be represented in this context. You can create a feature branch and a release branch before applying the ‘branch filter’ when you create your ‘build’ definition (more on this below).</p><h3>CI/CD Workflow</h3><p>DevOps can’t be separated from the concept of CI/CD. Continuous integration (CI) simply means a series of practices to implement when integrating working copies to a shared repository. It represents the beginning of the CI/CD pipeline which starts from the new changes in source code and is committed from a local source control repository then pushed to a remote source code repository, a trigger based on the aforementioned process can be configured to trigger an automated build, and it is also possible to run tests during the build.</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c45315226ac9a7d11_releasepipelineCI.png"></p></figure><p>Continuous Integration</p><p>CI/CD tools such as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provided by Microsoft allows you to create the Build definition to turn this process into reality. It allows you to configure different build tasks, and these tasks perform the build from the source code. There are two kinds of triggers available in VSTS:</p><ul><li>Continuous integration trigger: this is applied on a Git, TFS ( which is recommended by Microsoft) or another source control repository which allows you to specify a listening branch while new changes in code are committed and then run an automated build.</li><li>Scheduled trigger: this is applied on select days and times to run an automated build.</li></ul><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c5e626f31b7281872_CI.png"></p></figure><p>Two types of build triggers</p><p>Other available DevOps tools that I’d like to mention are Jenkins, Ansible, Github, and Bitbucket.</p><h3>Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment</h3><p>Let’s continue discussing CI/CD, the release part of pipeline started when a new, successful build is available. There are two types of CD which is continuous delivery and continuous deployment.</p><p>Continuous delivery is a series of practices to deliver each change to a staging environment which can then be deployed to production in a manual way.</p><p>Continuous deployment is different from continuous delivery because every change after a successful build is deployed to production in an automatic way.</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c071de866dceeb7ca_puppet_continuous_diagram.gif"></p></figure><p>Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment</p><p>Similarly, VSTS also allows the continuous delivery or deployment by creating a ‘release’ definition (shown below). The definition can be based on the build from VSTS or directly from Jenkins or another source that publishes the artifact to be deployed:</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c5e626f0472281873_release-definition-.png"></p></figure><p>Creating release definition from different artifacts</p><p>And then, by configuring different release tasks, these tasks can be automated or manual as shown:</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c071de8797deeb7cb_task-catalog.png"></p></figure><p>Task catalog in release definition</p><h2>Getting Started With Containers</h2><p>As high-level virtualization technology, containers provide an isolated and independent environment. Containers such as Docker perform the virtualization of the operating system as well as the related infrastructure. Docker enforces the portability and agility of applications and acts as a deployment unit while deploying multiple containers clusters.</p><h3>Docker Architecture</h3><p>Docker uses a client-server architecture and can be built into three essential parts: the Docker client, the Docker host with Docker daemon and Docker registry within the architecture.</p><ul><li>Docker Client where Docker environments should be installed to build Docker images with a target application.</li><li>Docker Host is a managed host with Docker daemon (also known as Dockerd which is the persistent process that manages containers).</li><li>Docker Registry provides or stores different Docker images. The best known open communities for Docker images are Docker hub, nginx (the official Docker image) and the Docker store.</li></ul><p>The Docker client can communicate with Docker daemon by using the RESTful API over UNIX sockets or a network interface in two ways:</p><ul><li>Docker clients can run on the same system with Docker daemon.</li><li>Docker clients connect to a remote Docker daemon.</li></ul><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c5e626f09e4281874_Screen-Shot-2018-06-13-at-19.12.20.png"></p></figure><p>Docker architecture</p><p>Other important Docker related tools are:</p><p>Docker Compose is a tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. A configuration file in YAML format is used to configure your application’s services.</p><p>A DockFile is necessary to define what will be added in the Docker container, then paired with the Docker command to build a Docker image and pull the image to the Docker registry.</p><h3>Docker on Azure</h3><p>Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Container Service (ACS) to secure and manage enterprise container apps in the cloud and an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to manage Docker images which are controlled by Azure AD. Azure also provides Azure Container Instances (ACI) which offers a more simple, faster way to run a container in Azure without thinking about the infrastructure level.</p><p>Microsoft also provides some useful tools while working with Docker in Azure such as Virtual Studio online, Visual Studio code, and the Visual Studio extension Docker.</p><h3>Container-clustering Solutions in Azure</h3><p>To run an application with more than 100 instances to act as container clusters, there are a couple of container orchestrators which simplify the management of container clusters.</p><p>The open-source container orchestrators are popular in the market such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Marathon of Mesosphere’s DC/OS (which is designed for big data analytics solution and facilities to deploy Hadoop clusters, OpenShift, Rancher, CoreOS Tectonic, Docker EE and others).</p><h3>Kubernetes in Azure</h3><p>As time goes by, I think that Kubernetes is winning the competition between container orchestrators for many reasons. Microsoft Azure has also launched a service currently in preview mode, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Microsoft considers Kubernetes the best balance between function and performance. It applies master/slave architecture which is a model of communication where one device or process acts as the master to control one or more other devices (slave). It facilitates the deployment of microservices while each node should scale and work independently.</p><p>Microsoft recommends deploying multiple masters (generally three nodes as master node) in Azure, then balances the number of slave nodes depending on the scenario. If you’re working with Microsoft Azure and need to deploy clusters with master/slave architecture, you can check my <a href="https://github.com/cloudmelon/azure-multiple-vmss-linux" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">GitHub repository</a> where you can find some useful ARMs (Azure Resource Manager) templates.</p><p>Microsoft Azure also provides a container service known as Azure Container Services. It implements the popular container orchestrators managed by Kubernetes in Azure, and it offers many useful features such as:</p><ul><li>Easy management of containers even when there are more than 100 instances.</li><li>Easy scaling.</li><li>Support popular operating systems such as Linux and Windows.</li><li>Easy roll-out and rollback.</li><li>Can combine with batch processing or cron jobs.</li><li>Automatic bin packing (e.g., depends on GPU/CPU usage).</li></ul><p>In the Azure Marketplace, a standard/advanced version of Docker EE for Azure is available so users can deploy Docker directly in Azure. There are options such as Mesos (DC/OS on Azure) for the same purpose.</p><h3>Reference Deployment Methods</h3><p>To improve the resilience of the applications that we’ve deployed with container-clustering solutions, I’d like to recommend several deployment methods.</p><h3>Blue/Green Deployment</h3><p>Blue/Green deployments, also known as B/G deployments or Red/Black deployments. The main principle is to deploy two identical environments which are configured in the same way. Generally, while one environment is live and in use by users, the other environment stays idle. When downtime occurs, this architecture allows to redirect the incoming traffic to the idle configuration which runs the original version with the help of load balancer. The target is to reduce downtime during production deployments.</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497c5e626f2387281875_BG-Deployment.png"></p></figure><h3>Canary Release</h3><p>In this method – which is typically used in production without impacting the current version – the implementation is similar to B/G deployment by deploying the latest version of the application into production which acts as a ‘canary.’ This version integrates with other apps and every infrastructure environment to simulate what it will look like in the real production, but to which no public users are routed at the moment. After that, all related influencers feel satisfied with the new version, more servers will be released and more users will be routed to the new version. Remember to implement a safety rollback strategy in case of any issue detected in the future.</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d514fd9493b0575f03520bd/5d66497cf0c4151b513deec5_canary-release.jpeg"></p></figure><p>Canary release</p><h3>Recommended Deployment Tools</h3><p>Infrastructure as code software such as TerraForm would be a great choice to manage the high-level configuration. It creates files with a .tf extension and the content in YAML format.</p><p>The command you need to apply to all your configurations is terraform apply.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Digital transformations – when transitioning from on-premise to the cloud – DevOps, …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <p><em>Disclaimer: This post as well as the code accompanying it contains some direct and indirect references to potentially 
offensive language. This is an analysis of stand-up comedy, which tends to contain curse words, racial slurs, etc. 
However, all references are made with objective, academic intent. If you have any concerns with my treatment of 
certain language, I’d be happy to have a conversation. You can get in touch with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaplanstephen/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>

<p>This post documents my first foray into unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and 
recommender systems. I completed this project over a 2-week span during my time as a student at
<a href="https://thisismetis.com/" target="_blank">Metis</a>.</p>

<p>The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/standup-comedy-recommender" target="_blank">here</a>.
The Flask app I made for this project can be found <a href="https://standup-comedy-recommender.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p><img src="https://stephenjkaplan.github.io/images/2020-09-18/comedy.jpg" alt="Comedy">
<small>Comedy! (Image: <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/stand-up-comedy-scripts/">Scraps from the Loft</a>)</small></p>

<p>A little over halfway through the Metis data science bootcamp, the curriculum shifted from 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank">supervised</a> to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning" target="_blank">unsupervised</a> learning. At that point, my brain was<br>
firmly in “predict y given X” mode, and it quite honestly took a few days to wrap my head around what it means 
to use machine learning on unlabeled data, and why that would even be useful. It clicked when I applied a 
rudimentary model of the human brain to both of these approaches: often our brains make inferences based 
on our previous experiences and knowledge (supervised learning). However, sometimes we are forced to find previously 
unseen patterns in the world around us (unsupervised learning) before we can make decisions.</p>

<p>Concurrently, we were introduced to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a> (NLP). In addition 
to learning a lot specifically about NLP, one big takeaway was a clearer understanding of what is meant by
“Artificial Intelligence” in the context of machine learning - any instance 
of a computer being able to imitate (or even replicate) a human perception or ability. After this realization, 
I went from being somewhat weary of apply machine learning to text/speech, to extremely motivated to 
work on an NLP problem.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the main requirements of this project were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use unsupervised learning.</li>
  <li>Use text as the primary data source.</li>
</ol>

<p>I almost instantly came up with an idea. Stand-up comedy specials are usually in a 1-hour monologue 
format, and are rich and diverse in topics, opinions, colloquialisms, and regional english dialects.
For that reason, and also the fact that I’m a huge fan of the comedy world, I knew that this would be
a stimulating project.</p>

<h3 id="data-wrangling">Data Wrangling</h3>

<p>Luckily, I was able to quickly find a website 
(<a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/stand-up-comedy-scripts/" target="_blank">Scraps from the Loft</a>) with several hundred 
comedy transcripts. I used the Python <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank">requests</a>) library 
in a <a href="https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/standup-comedy-recommender/blob/master/analysis/data_acquisition.py" target="_blank">script</a> to acquire all of the raw HTML for each transcript, and 
<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup</a> to parse the main text and 
various metadata (comedian, title of comedy special, year).</p>

<p>After inserting the data into pandas dataframes (one for the metadata and one for the text corpus), I stored 
it in a remote <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">Mongo</a> database on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance. Admittedly, 
this wasn’t really necessary as my corpus was small enough to store locally , but I wanted to get more comfortable with 
both creating MongoDB collections and querying data for analysis and modeling using 
<a href="https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">pymongo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="data-cleaning--the-nlp-pipeline">Data Cleaning &amp; The NLP Pipeline</h3>

<p>As we had been warned, cleaning and preparing the text corpus proved to be the most critical, time 
consuming part of this project. Topic modeling (and clustering) of text data relies on sufficient elimination 
of extraneous words, but also careful inclusion of words that might be indicators of a topic.</p>

<p>First, I performed some “macro” cleaning, removing entire documents (individual transcripts) that would 
throw off the modeling and/or not be relevant in a recommender app. That involved removing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comedy specials in different languages (there were a handful in Italian and Spanish).</li>
  <li>Comedy specials that are not widely available (or available at all) on streaming platforms.</li>
  <li>Short-form comedy such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--IS0XiNdpk" target="_blank">monologues on Saturday Night Live</a>, 
or other late night TV shows.</li>
</ul>

<p>I then created an “<a href="https://github.com/stephenjkaplan/standup-comedy-recommender/blob/master/app/nlp_pipeline.py" target="_blank">NLP pipeline</a>”, 
that can take any document from the corpus and perform the following transformations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean the text by removing punctuation, non-essential parts like the person introducing the comedian, 
removing numbers, removing line breaks, crazy noises and expressions like “aaaaah”, and common English 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word" target="_blank">stop words</a>.</li>
  <li>“Lemmatized” words to reduce all forms of words to their base or “lemma”. (For example, “studies” and 
 “studying” become “study”). The purpose of this is to extract the core meaning and topics out of the text 
 rather than pay attention to how words are being used in the context of a sentence. The Python <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" target="_blank">NLTK</a> library 
 was very useful for this step and several of the previous steps.</li>
  <li>“Vectorized” the entire corpus. In general, this means converting the long strings of text to tabular format, 
 where each column is a word, each row represents a document in the corpus (also known as a 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix" target="_blank">doc-term matrix</a>), and each cell 
 contains a numerical representation of the words frequency of use or some other metric.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://stephenjkaplan.github.io/images/2020-09-18/cleaning.png" alt="cleaning">
<small>Summary of text cleaning steps.</small></p>

<p>The final data format is “fit” on the initial dataset, and then applied to any incoming data (as is the case with 
the <a href="#search-engine-recommender-with-content-based-filtering">search engine feature</a> described later in this post.)</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit on vectorization: I focused on trying out two <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_extraction.text" target="_blank">types/implementations of vectorization in 
scikit-learn</a>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer" target="_blank">Count Vectorizer</a>,
which simply counts the frequency of each word in each document/transcript.</li>
  <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer" target="_blank">TF-IDF Vectorizer</a>,
which calculates the product of term frequency with its inverse-document frequency (a scale of 0 to 1 where values 
closer to zero are common in the entire dataset of transcripts). This is a valuable metric because it weights 
words that are common in a document more heavily if they aren’t common in general, which is a useful tool for 
ultimately extracting distinct topics.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, creating this pipeline was an iterative process. I tried out different transformations and did 
topic modeling (explained in the next section) to evaluate the effectiveness of different components in the pipeline. 
This helped inform my decision to vectorize the text with <strong>TF-IDF</strong>, as it yielded topics that were much 
more discernible and easy to label by looking at each topic’s top words.</p>

<p>One other note important note is that using pre-built lists of common English stop words to remove from the 
dataset isn’t a complete solution. I had to do quite a bit of combing through the transcripts to identify 
insignificant, yet common words and manually add them to the stop words list. It may come as no surprise that 
curse words are extremely prevalent in comedy, and don’t usually add much meaning, so I had to include some 
pretty aggressive words in my code (several of which are fairly offensive and I wouldn’t use in conversation).</p>

<p>Aside from also removing names/other irrelevant proper nouns, I also had to carefully decide what to do about racial slurs.
Like it or not, racial slurs are common in stand-up comedy and can sometimes carry important meaning with regards to a 
comedian’s jokes. As a result, I left many of them in the dataset, but was also tasked with the uncomfortable task of 
hard-coding some extremely antiquated language in the NLP pipeline class for removal.</p>

<h3 id="modeling--flask-app-features">Modeling &amp; Flask App Features</h3>

<p>My main objective for this project was to develop a Flask application that provided more nuanced 
recommendations of comedy specials than what’s currently available on mainstream streaming platforms. I scoped 
out two features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A dropdown genre filter using genres that were created by machine learning algorithms (as opposed to 
human labeling.)</li>
  <li>A search bar that allows a user to describe the comedy they want to see, and get content-based 
recommendations.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can play around with the app <a href="https://standup-comedy-recommender.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-genre-filters-with-topic-modeling">Automatic Genre Filters with Topic Modeling</h4>

<p>Creating machine-learned genres involves first applying the unsupervised learning technique of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model" target="_blank">topic modeling</a>, transforming the resulting 
data to extract which words are most closely related with each topic, and then performing the manual task 
of giving each topic a reasonable label.</p>

<p>In relatively simple terms, topic modeling involves reducing the dimensions of the document-term matrix (words) to a specified number 
of columns (representing the topics, and a weighting for each topic to each document). I tried a few different dimensionality reduction techniques including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis" target="_blank">Latent Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA), 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation" target="_blank">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> (LDA), and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization" target="_blank">Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</a> (NMF). 
Ultimately, the 
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html" target="_blank">scikit-learn implementation of NMF</a>
yielded the most discernible topics.</p>

<p><img src="https://stephenjkaplan.github.io/images/2020-09-18/topics.png" alt="topics">
<small>Examples of top words associated with modeled topics.</small></p>

<p>Based on the top words generated from each topic, I used my knowledge of comedy to select the following genres:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Observational</strong>: This is sort of a catch-all for “average”, “every day” topics such as family, chores, marriage, pets, etc. This type of 
 comedy is quite common.</li>
  <li><strong>Immigrant Upbringing</strong>: Many comedians are 1st generation Americans with parents that immigrated to the US and brought their 
culture with them. Comedians with recently immigrated families often talk about the humorous struggles of assimilation, the quirks 
of their various cultures, the pressures of their parents, and hardworking nature of their families.</li>
  <li><strong>Relationships &amp; Sex</strong>: This is another very common topic in comedy, particularly for “dirty” comedians. The sub-topics range 
from dating, to LGBTQ humor, and heavily sexual jokes.</li>
  <li><strong>British/Australian</strong>: This topic was selected almost entirely based on colloquialisms of the comedian. While the United Kingdom 
and Australia have different cultures, they share some slang in common. If I were to continue to spend time on this project, I would 
probably try and separate these two topics, as British comedy historically is associate with a specific type of “dry” humor. That being said,
many non-American english-speaking comedians share a common …</li></ul></article></div></div>

<p>When presented with a problem, first spend time elucidating the problem space before addressing potential solutions.&nbsp; Interestingly, I think the intuitive and most common approach is to do the opposite: present and advocate for your solution. &nbsp; I think the reason for this is that people tend to assume that others understand the problem as clearly as you do, that you have a full understanding of the problem, and that you understand which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve for the business.&nbsp; Thus, the only thing that is interesting is the solution you came up with – a solution that is either clever or based on your notable experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem though is that these assumptions are usually wrong.&nbsp; Typically if you spend time first fleshing out the problem, you will realize that other people on the team have context on the problem that you don’t have.&nbsp; Or that they do not share an understanding of what the problem is or that there is disagreement about what aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve first.&nbsp; Often you will realize that people are focused on solving the technical problem but that they do not have a good understanding of the <em>business </em>problem.&nbsp; It is critical that the business problem is clearly fleshed out before addressing the technical problem.</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Spend time talking about the problem before anyone presents solutions.&nbsp; It will make sure everyone has the same context.&nbsp; It ensures that the business problem is the focus and that people will agree – <em>before presenting their solution ideas</em> – which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve. This process helps remove ego from the conversation, which can develop when a group of smart highly experienced present different solutions that incidentally emphasize different aspects of the problem.&nbsp; Time spent on the problem space consistently will help you identify better solutions, more efficiently, and with less drama.</p>

<p><strong><em>Split-tracking – prevent circular and chaotic conversations.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I have seen a number of conversations about thorny problems go in circles and not only fail to identify good solutions but even make little progress towards a shared understanding of the problem space.&nbsp; How do you prevent this from happening?&nbsp; The primary thing to do is to keep your conversation organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to do so is to use a technique called <em>split-tracking</em>.&nbsp; Split-tracking is a technique, in which you identify that more than one issue or concern has been raised, bring group awareness to this observation, generate consensus that there is more than one issue at play, and then push others to focus on one issue at a time. &nbsp; Why does this help? &nbsp; People often don’t realize that they are conflating two issues so they don’t realize when they are jumping back and forth between these issues.&nbsp; If these issues are not explicitly identified and separated, it can be hard to probe and press a person’s thinking on an issue – they can unconsciously side-step into the second issue. If there are multiple people discussing a problem, it is possible for people to start going in circles if different people re-direct the group to a secondary issue and then another person brings it back to the first issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Be on the lookout for multiple underlying issues and concerns.&nbsp; If you see them, stop the conversation and say,  “I am hearing two issues here.&nbsp; One is issue $X and other is issues $Y.&nbsp; Which one should we focus on first?” &nbsp; Make sure other people realize that there are separate issues – even if they are correlated – and get them to agree to work on them separately.&nbsp; In general, think like a scientist – care about the taxonomy of your problem and neatly classify all the sub-problems that exist and their relation to each other (i.e., this is a subproblem of this bigger problem).&nbsp; You can work towards a solution much more effectively, if the problem space is well organized and explicitly understood by everyone in the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Empathy – prevent friction and “land mines” from stopping forward progress.</em></strong></p>



<p>Have you ever been in a meeting discussing a problem, making some progress, and then just suddenly had all forward progress come screeching to a halt? &nbsp; Usually this happens when people become defensive or if the conversation triggered an emotional response in someone.&nbsp; How do we prevent this from happening?&nbsp; Although each individual needs to work to keep the bigger picture in mind and to keep their ego out of the conversation, you cannot control other people’s reactions.&nbsp; So what can you do?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Work on being more empathetic in your communication.&nbsp; Carefully consider how others view the problem and how some aspects of the problem may impact them and their work more than you.&nbsp; Consider that even if they have less relevant experience than you, that they still want their viewpoints to be considered and valued.&nbsp; In general, approach people and their thoughts with curiosity.&nbsp; Try to clarify your understanding of their perspective and make it clear that you are spending time trying to understand their views.</p>



<p>If you do this, you will be less likely to trigger an emotional response that will put a lot of friction between you and your solution.&nbsp; You will make people feel heard even if the solution that is ultimately arrived at doesn’t solve their main pain points. When you approach problems empathetically, it is also easier to build consensus and excitement in the group, which is critical. Identifying the solution is not the final step – implementing the solution is, and you want a motivated team to tackle that step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emphasizing empathy when working with others has a few other advantages.&nbsp; One, because empathy is driven by curiosity about someone’s perspective, it makes it easier to identify genuine issues that you hadn’t been considering previously, thereby enriching your understanding of the problem.&nbsp; Two, it will help you identify nuances in the concerns of others, providing opportunities for split-tracking and organization of the conversation.&nbsp; Three, empathetic communication enhances psychological safety of the group, which in turn means that all people will feel comfortable voicing their concerns and insights. A group that can communicate openly will be better at fleshing out the full problem space and thereby will be better at identifying the optimal solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, I would like to note although people inherently vary in how empathetic they are, it is also a skill that can be cultivated. &nbsp; So make it a mindset that you work actively to engage in.&nbsp; Cultivate your curiosity. If you struggle with it, try meditation. Its core teaching is the power of developing an open loving curiosity about the world.&nbsp; I’ve spent a week in silent meditation, and I can tell you that if you can find the in and out flow of your breath to be fascinating, then it becomes easy to be intrigued by the perspective of your peers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring – keep the conversation on track</strong></p>



<p>The part of the brain involved in understanding and solving a problem, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is distinct from the part of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex, that is involved in monitoring your environment and behavior for errors that signal a course correction is needed.&nbsp; I have noticed that leaders, who are great at moving a team towards optimal solutions, are able to keep this monitoring brain area highly activated even as they also help the team move towards a solution.&nbsp; They tend to be constantly scanning the conversation at a meta-level looking for issues that will derail it.&nbsp; So what type of issues are they monitoring for?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Establish what you are monitoring for and set the conditions.&nbsp; </em>To know what to monitor for, you first need to clearly identify, at the start of a meeting, what your agenda is and what the basic problem(s) is that you will address.&nbsp; Once there is consensus here, it will be clearer to you if the conversation has moved off track and what you should be monitoring for.&nbsp; Moreover, it also ensures that you have needed conditions for keeping the conversation on track.&nbsp; For example, given your agenda, you should evaluate whether you even have the right decision makers in the room.&nbsp; Do you have unnecessary people who can push the conversation into tangents or are you lacking the needed people so that even if you make a decision, you may not be able to act upon that decision?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation below the right level?&nbsp; </em>Is someone “going into the weeds” by diving into a technical explanation that isn’t needed right now? &nbsp; Monitor for this and pull the group out quickly. &nbsp; At best, it is just a waste of time.&nbsp; At worst, it will derail the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation above the right level?&nbsp; </em>Similarly, thoughts can steer the conversation to a level above the agenda.&nbsp; For example, if your company recently switched to a pods organization and there is some question about how to best handle ownership of one line of work in this new pod structure, it can be easy for the conversation to suddenly be about the pods themselves – whether they are good and how to change and improve the pods.&nbsp; This level of conversation would be above the one set in your agenda, is not one that you want to or are capable of addressing in your current meeting, and if you even were interested in addressing it, you probably don’t have the right people in the room to do so.&nbsp; Pull …</p></div></article></div>
