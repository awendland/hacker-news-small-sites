<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

<p><b>Welcome to Miniscope.org Wiki! Follow the project on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/MiniscopeTeam">@MiniscopeTeam</a>.</b>
</p><p>We are happy to announce the release of our next generation, open-source Miniscope platform, <a href="http://miniscope.org/index.php/Miniscope_V4" title="Miniscope V4">Miniscope V4</a>. This new system is a substantial leap forward over previous designs and will serve as the base Miniscope platform for years to come. An overview of new features can be found below:
</p>
<ul><li> &gt;1mm diameter field of view</li>
<li> ~1mm working distance</li>
<li> +/-200um electronic focal adjustment</li>
<li> All achromatic optics</li>
<li> 2.6 grams</li>
<li> 22mm tall</li>
<li> Absolute head orientation sensor</li>
<li> Requires ~1/5th the excitation power of previous systems</li>
<li> No more soldering!</li>
<li> Still uses only a single coaxial cable (down to 0.3mm in diameter) for power, communication, and data.</li>
<li> New DAQ software</li></ul>
<p>This wiki site provides a centralized location for sharing design files, source code, and other relevant information so that a community of users can share ideas and developments related to this important imaging technique. Our goal is to help disseminate this technology to the larger neuroscience community and build a foundation of users that will continue advancing this technology and contribute back to the project. While the Miniscope system described here is not an off-the-shelf commercial solution, we have focused on making it as easy as possible for the average neuroscience lab to build and modify, requiring no soldering and simple hands-on assembly. The Miniscope project and Miniscope.org are on going projects and will be routinely updated over the coming months and years.
</p>


<h2><span id="Current_Status_of_Project">Current Status of Project</span></h2>
<p>The Miniscope project is now in its 6th year of development at UCLA and in its third major revision. Miniscope developers have used Miniscopes to understand  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature17955.html">how the brain links memories across time in Nature, 2016</a> and how <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0559-0">spatial coding breaks down in epilepsy in Nature Neuroscience, 2019</a>. The work and files available on this site are the most up-to-date public version of our system and will be updated frequently with improvements and new system features. We encourage Miniscope users to contribute to this development process! This wiki is designed for this very purpose.
</p><p>Initial access to the miniscope.org wiki was enabled mid January, 2016.
</p><p><b>Important:</b> Using this system we have successfully imaged Hippocampal CA1, Subiculum, Dorsal Striatum, Parietal Cortex, Prefrontal Cortex, and Visual Cortex using 0.5mm, 1mm, 1.8mm, and 2mm diameter GRIN lenses from either Grintech or GoFoton. (More information on GRIN lenses can be found <a href="http://miniscope.org/index.php/GRIN_Lens_Information" title="GRIN Lens Information">here</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Within the last decades web technologies have evolved in a very rapid way. Nowadays, with things like WebAssembly, PWA, constantly progressing browser API and other surrounding technologies, web has a great potential to become a universal platform for a wide range of tasks and applications.</p><p>With web app’s area of responsibility expanding, more attention is paid to app performance. User experience became an important thing to care about, especially when you develop an app that runs on multiple devices.</p><p>To be able to manage performance appropriately, one need to know how the rendering pipeline of the browser works and where potential bottlenecks can be found.</p><h2 id="page-rendering">Page Rendering</h2><p>Web page load simply starts from entering the URL in the address bar. In fact, a bunch of things happen right after that and even before HTML request is done. Some of them can influence the performance, but we’ll leave this part for another dedicated article. Now we are interested in things happening when the HTML file has been loaded:</p><ol><li><strong>Parse HTML</strong>
HTML document parsed and the DOM tree as we know it has been built.</li><li><strong>Recalculate Styles</strong>
All kind of stylesheets are parsed. <em>Render tree</em> is built. <em>Render tree</em> contains DOM tree nodes that are going to be displayed. Thus, <code>head</code> tag is excluded as well as <code>style</code> and <code>script</code>. Elements with CSS <code>display</code> property set to <code>none</code> are also ignored. On the other hand, pseudo elements, such as <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code>, are included. Moreover, every text line becomes a single block.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> (also called <em>reflow</em>)
A collection of blocks generated from the render tree. All the block dimensions, that are dependent on each other, are calculated.</li><li><strong>Paint</strong>
Rasterization of the blocks and texts. Images decoding and resize if necessary also happen here.</li><li><strong>Layer Composition</strong>
Composition of the visual layers that can be processed and painted independently.</li></ol><p>All the phases can be found in the Chrome DevTools’ Performance tab. In reality some of the steps above happen in parallel, e.g. CSS and HTML parsing since HTML document contains styles and stylesheet links in it, so it makes sense to perform DOM and CSSOM processing in parallel. </p><p>Any time you want to change a view on the page using javascript (or CSS animation) this pipeline gets fired. Although it is not necessary to parse HTML file and rebuild the whole render tree (usually only part of it), a proper processing for the visual update is required. Depending on requested changes, browser skips some of the steps, but in general, the pipeline would look like this:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg 1093w" sizes="(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px" alt="Image of Frame Pipeline"></p><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2><p>You might not need to know all of this when you’re just adding a couple of paragraphs, or modifying background color once every blue moon. Everything changes when it comes to a complex animation and continuous DOM updates. Normally contemporary screens have frequency 60Hz, which means that new frame ought to be rendered 60 times per second (60 FPS). Therefore, browser have <code>1000/60 ≈ 16ms</code> for doing his job on every frame. If it takes more time, the FPS decreases, animation might become jerky and user gets disappointed.</p><p>In the old browsers animation was usually implemented with <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function, which wasn’t initially designed for this purpose. <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function knows nothing about the browser reflow, thus visual changes might be requested at the middle of the pipeline, cancelling the last steps of the work on a previous frame and causing recalculations. Therefore we have missing frames and possible worthless work done, which might be critical in the scale of 16 ms and leads to janky animations.</p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Fortunately, modern browsers have a proper method to deal with it. <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is the browser API that provides a sufficient way to perform animations. The call for this function (with a callback as a first argument) asks the browser to call it right before the next styles calculation, so it won’t get interrupted in the middle of the next frame processing. </p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>changeTheDOM</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>There is a common way to implement continuous javascript animation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>handleFrame</span><span>(</span><span>currentAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>prevAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    prevAnimationTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> diffTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime </span><span>-</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>changeDOM</span><span>(</span><span>diffTime</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>The first argument that is passed to the callback is the time in milliseconds passed from the navigation start (from the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">time origin</a>). We can use it to know the time difference with the last frame and adapt our animation properly. We can use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> return value to stop an animation with <code>cancelAnimationFrame</code>:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> requestID</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>handleFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>changeDOM</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    requestID </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>startAnimation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    requestID </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>stopAnimation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>cancelAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>requestID</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="forced-reflow-layout">Forced Reflow (Layout)</h2><p>However, there are underwater rocks. There is a set of methods and attributes that require browser to know a layout state, e.g. <code>offsetWidth</code>, <code>getComputedStyle()</code> and others. In other words, if you do changes to the layout and then request such a property a few lines after, browser will have to recalculate all the size relations and perform layout step twice. Which, again, on the scale of 16 ms has consequences on performance.</p><p>You can find the full list of methods and properties that trigger forced layout <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. </p><p>Also I would recommend this <a href="https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/course-notes/browser-rendering-optimization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">course</a> from Paul Lewis and Cameron Pittman which talks in details about rendering pipeline and optimizations. </p><h2 id="frontend-monitoring">Frontend Monitoring</h2><p>Asayer is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your web app behaves for every issue.

September 1, 2020 | https://mattperry.is/writing-code/browsers-may-throttle-requestanimationframe-to-30fps | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mattperry.is/writing-code/browsers-may-throttle-requestanimationframe-to-30fps">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> (rAF) is a browser API that allows the execution of code before the next available frame on the device display.</p><pre><pre><p><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>timestamp</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>All modern JavaScript animation libraries, like <a href="https://framer.com/motion">Framer Motion</a>, use this API to increment the visual properties of DOM elements, 3D models, or canvas contexts to create motion on the web.</p><p>However, it isn't a guarentee that this method <em>will</em> run before every frame. A browser might choose to run <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> at lower intervals, and this leads to jerky animations.</p><p>Look at these two boxes:</p><p>If your browser <em>doesn't</em> fall into one of the situations we'll explore in this post, the top box will be animating smoothly at 60fps. The second box is artificially running at half the framerate of the top box. You can see how apparent the effect of halving the framerate is for the smoothness of animations.</p><p>Because the situations in which a browser might choose to throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> aren't always obvious or consistent, debugging these animations can be a mind-bending experience.</p><p>If you're on this page, you might well have arrived via Google, trying to understand why your JavaScript animation is janky. I imagine you sat there, as I once was, with two identical iPhones side by side, running the same JavaScript animation, one at the expected 60fps and one at a jerky 30fps.</p><p>You're not going crazy. Your browser is. Let's take a look at when and why browsers throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</p><h2 id="ios-throttles raf in low-power mode">iOS throttles rAF in low-power mode</h2><p>Discovering this was a real test of sanity. Debugging animations on an old website, I noticed all the animations were janky on my phone.</p><p>Suspecting garbage collection or other source of low-performing animations, I tried to debug on my MacBook. Nothing unusual about memory consumption. I set CPU throttling to maxium. Still 60fps.</p><p>I put my phone next to my partner's, same OS, same make and model. 60fps on hers, unmistakably 30 on mine.</p><p>I started to suspect the paint job. But then I spotted this on my screen:</p><img src="https://mattperry.is/photos/code/low-power-mode.png"><p>Toggling low-power mode on and off had an immediate effect on the smoothness of the animations. I found <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168837">a Webkit issue</a> that confirmed iOS throttles <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> in low-power mode, along with <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169138">all CSS animations</a>.</p><p>It's a clever battery-saving trick, and one of an infinite array of examples why developing against mobile browsers is such a dreadful, soul-crushing experience.</p><p>iOS app developers are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/LowPowerMode.html">given the ability and responsibility</a> to respond to low-power mode. Yet Webkit's characteristic obstinence is the reason why Battery Status API is now <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API">deprecated</a>.</p><h2 id="safari-throttles raf in cross-origin iframes">Safari throttles rAF in cross-origin iframes</h2><p>The example at the top of the frame is running in a cross-origin iframe. "Cross origin" essentially means that iframe is serving content from a different domain from that of this site.</p><p>If you're using Safari, you may have noticed that not even the first box was running very smoothly. Go back and click inside the iframe. The animation should start running as expected.</p><p>The <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170534">Webkit ticket</a> doesn't provide a reason for this behaviour. To speculate, iframes are commonly used for advertising. Adverts are liberal with your CPU cycles, often using quite overt attention-stealing animations.</p><p>So the throttling is an attempt to prevent adverts from draining your battery. The framerate is uncapped on interaction because that's considered a sign of intent that the content is acceptable by the user.</p><p>In an age of ad-blockers this solution feels like the wrong approach. Preferably, iOS would take a more aggressive stance against adverts by default, then revert this change.</p><p>Make the web less shit, not more shit.</p><h2 id="firefox-obliterates javascript time accuracy for privacy features">Firefox obliterates JavaScript time accuracy for privacy features</h2><p>I was first made aware of this via a ticket about <a href="https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/441">laggy animations in Firefox</a>. Firefox users across browsers and devices were all reporting the same issue, but I couldn't replicate it myself on any operating system.</p><p>It turns out that Firefox has an anti-tracking privacy setting called <code>resistFingerprinting</code> that, if enabled, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1394735#c1">reduces JavaScript time accuracy to 100ms</a>.</p><p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440863">This Bugzilla ticket</a> details the ramifications of Mozilla lowering the accuracy of <code>performance.now()</code> to just 2ms(!). That's considered low enough to cause havoc in game calculations, so 100ms is certainly low enough to wreck animations.</p><p>The previous cases of throttling we've seen only halved framerate. 100ms is enough to swallow six whole frames of animation! Callbacks provided to <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> receive the timestamp of the latest frame, and in animation libraries this is used to calculate the correct visual output. If the timestamp isn't accurate, the animations will be a visual manifestation of that.</p><p>Luckily there is a potential fix. The MDN (RIP) page for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now#Reduced_time_precision">performance.now()</a> says that serving content with the following headers will allow your page to access high resolution timers:</p><pre><pre><p><span>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin</span></p><p><span>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</span></p></pre></pre><p>High resolution timers === smooth animation.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is just that - a request. It's to the browser's discretion whether that request is granted, and as we've seen, there are a variety of situations where it might not.</p><p>It's a trade off. By degrading the quality of the experience for users, browsers can improve their battery life, or hide them from advertising companies.</p><p>The quality of the web experience is currently at an all-time low, so in my opinion it's a shame to see anything making it even worse.</p><p>For the sanity of the developers having to work with these browsers, the very least I could ask is that, when enforced, these throttling techniques were flagged in the Performance tab. It would give us sharable and repeatable reproduction steps for ourselves and users to follow when they encounter this bizarre behaviour, as the next optimisation is always around the corner...</p><blockquote><p>Discovered more throttling madness? Hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/mattgperry">Twitter</a>!</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
                        <p><strong>This summer, a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for the first real test flight of the scaled flight model of the energy-efficient aircraft design called the Flying-V. The project was announced last year together with KLM. After a period of extensive wind tunnel testing and a series of ground tests in the Netherlands, it was time to perform the first flight and obtain an impression of the flight characteristics. The aircraft had a very successful maiden flight.</strong></p><p>Project leader Dr Roelof Vos and his team of researchers and engineers took the 22.5 kg and 3 m wide scale model of the Flying-V for flight tests to a well-guarded airbase in Germany, where they could work together with a team from Airbus. The pilot’s task was to take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries were nearly empty and land. And he succeeded. Vos: “One of our worries was that the aircraft might have some difficulty lifting-off, since previous calculations had shown that ‘rotation’ could be an issue. The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You need to fly to know for sure.” Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.</p><p>But testing new technology is never straightforward. The team had a challenging week in which they had to change the centre of gravity of the aircraft and fix the antenna to improve telemetry. The flight has now also confirmed that the current design still shows too much ‘Dutch roll’, causing a slightly rough landing. A next step for the team is to use the data collected during the flight for an aerodynamic (software) model of the aircraft. This will make it possible to programme it in a flight simulator to be used in future research , while further improving the flight characteristics. The team will also prepare the scale model for future flight tests.&nbsp;</p><div id="c651315">

</div><div id="c650988"><p>The Flying-V is a design for a highly energy-efficient long-distance aeroplane. The aircraft’s design integrates the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings, creating a spectacular V-shape. Computer calculations have predicted that the aircraft’s improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today’s most advanced aircraft. KLM has been a partner in the project since 2019. Also due to their support, the project team has been able to build this scale model. It was first presented at the 100th anniversary of KLM in October 2019. Various business partners are now involved in the project, including Airbus. Airbus is also an explicit supporter for the first flight. The partners are working together on a research plan to fine-tune the concept. Next step: providing the Flying-V with sustainable propulsion, taking into account that the design seems highly suitable to carry liquid hydrogen instead of kerosene. </p></div><div id="c650998"><p><em>Webcast</em>: On 1 September Dr. Roelof Vos and Prof. Henri Werij showed and explained what happened during the test week.

<p><span>I</span>n February 2019, Amos Dov Silver, a slight man in his mid-30s who often wears his shoulder-length hair in a bun, received a Telegram message inviting him to a wedding in Ukraine. The sender had worked with Silver for more than two years and wanted him to stand in for his father at the altar. “As you know, I don’t have a family,” he wrote. Silver agreed, and the following month, he flew from Arizona to Kyiv. Less than 48 hours later, he awoke to find five Israeli police officers standing in his hotel room.</p>



<p>Silver, an American-Israeli from a Hasidic background, started using his Facebook page as a marketplace to connect marijuana dealers with buyers in 2015, after years of loudly advocating for the drug’s legalization in Israel. This was four years after the emergence of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder">Silk Road</a>, which quickly became the gold standard for decentralized, anonymous marketplaces operating on the darknet. Founded by the American Ross Ulbricht (whose online <em>nom de guerre </em>was<em> </em>“Dread Pirate Roberts”), Silk Road was estimated to be worth over $1 billion within two years of its founding, selling everything from pot to AK-47s. As the website grew in notoriety, Ulbricht became a model for a new generation of digital drug kingpins — and, with his arrest in 2013, a harbinger of what might await successors like Silver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Israel decriminalized recreational marijuana use in 2017, Silver and a team of coders and managers transferred their service to the Russian messaging platform Telegram. The app is popular with activists and journalists around the world because of its end-to-end encryption, which means that the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt a message are stored with only the sender and receiver. This makes it essentially impossible for anyone, even the app maker, to decode an intercepted message. Thanks to this built-in anonymity, buying drugs through Telegrass became as easy as ordering a pizza. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Telegrass leadership doesn’t profit from individual deals; instead, to advertise their wares, dealers pay 420 shekels ($122.25) for access to the platform. Unscrupulous sellers are kicked off and get their names posted on a “wall of shame.”</p>



<p>When Telegrass arrived in Ukraine in 2017, its operators found conditions perfectly suited to running a black-market business. A permissive legal landscape and weak rule of law — as well as the large number of visiting Israelis — made it a natural candidate for Telegrass’ expansion. Additionally, while most countries mandate some form of identity verification to purchase a SIM card and register a phone number, Ukraine — along with Israel and the United States — does not, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace Telegram accounts registered under a phone number.</p>



<p>Soon after Telegrass launched in Ukraine, thousands of competing channels emerged, with the most popular attracting tens of thousands of subscribers. The old style of drug dealing, based on face-to-face interactions between consumers and dealers, disappeared. Viacheslav Markov, dean of the Faculty of Cyber Police at the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, has said that 90% of drug sales in Ukraine now occur via Telegram. Viacheslav Safonov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s Department for Combating Drug Crimes, concurs. In addition to being better for advertising, the new system is safer for dealers. When buyers knew who they had purchased drugs from, there was an inclination to “share” that information with law enforcement when pressed. Now, that’s no longer possible.</p>



<p>In prosecuting Silver, Israeli authorities claimed that “Telegrass changed the face of crime.” Less than two years after his arrest, it’s unclear whether Silver was personally responsible for transforming the drug market or if he was simply an early and influential adopter of technology that would become the status quo. Whichever is true, it’s clear that, in many parts of the world, the system that Telegrass perfected has become the dominant model for buying and selling illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>In Kyiv, graffiti</strong> advertising Telegram drug channels is visible on nearly every city block, with tags directing buyers to @go420, @Kushcrew, or @kyivweeds. David Plaster, who runs the Kyiv-based nonprofit Anomaly, said his organization painted over more than 15,000 tags over the last 18 months, half in the capital alone. But as soon as the graffiti is eliminated, more appears. And removing it has little impact on business. Marijuana, which is grown in outlying cities near Kyiv, accounts for an estimated 13 billion hryvnias ($500,000,000) in sales per month across Ukraine. The operations are decentralized, so employees often have no idea who they’re working with, or for. That means that even if low-level dealers get busted, suppliers and distributors remain hidden from law enforcement. “Even with a sting operation, faking a channel, you can only get the buyer; it doesn’t help with the supply chain,” Plaster explained. “You can’t crack that closed loop.”</p>

<p>Once a customer joins a drug channel on Telegram, a bot will typically respond with a menu of items available for purchase. On a typical day, offerings might include a popular strain called Gagarin, named for the Soviet cosmonaut, which is advertised as a hybrid with “aromas of mint and blueberry,” or a strain called White Russian, which is earthy and spicy with “cheese flavor.” When a customer makes a selection, an anonymous operator will send a link asking for payment via cryptocurrency or through an encrypted payment platform, which in Ukraine is usually EasyPay, a Belarusian e-payment platform that allows money transfers to be made via a phone number rather than a bank account. After the money is received, the seller will send an image that includes an address or GPS coordinates signaling where the drugs are hidden.</p>



<p>That day, March 12, law enforcement agents from Israel, the U.S., Ukraine, and Germany arrested 42 people in those countries in connection with Telegrass, the encrypted drug marketplace that Silver co-founded and ran. Directed by the Israel National Cyber Directorate, the bust marked the final stage of an international operation to take down the enterprise, which, by 2018, grossed an estimated $17 million a month in sales. Telegrass was one of the world’s biggest app-based drug markets, and, from Israel, it migrated to Germany, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe, spawning countless copycats.</p>



<p>The main downside of a fully anonymous marketplace is that it lends itself easily to fraud. Common scams include sellers accepting money before deleting a Telegram conversation or simply giving buyers phony drop-off locations. “[The channels are] often operated by men in prison who send these messages on their phones,” an anonymous buyer told <em>Rest of World</em>, adding that he would frequently have to try four or five different services before finding one that worked. Safonov, of the country’s anti-drug office, confirms that this kind of fraud makes up “one of the main types of ‘earnings’ for prisoners,” who will offer products at lower price points to target “novice consumers and those trying to save money.”</p>



<p>High levels of police mistrust have also contributed to theories that police are not only protecting the drug trade but actively participating in it. Telegram user @glodov, who advocates for marijuana legalization in Ukraine, claims that certain drug delivery channels are operated by police as avenues for extortion. He cited an instance in which a buyer went to pick up a package and encountered two officers waiting for him. “They tell you that you need to pay $100 or $200, and then they will leave you alone,” he says. “They want you to pay not to go to jail.”</p>



<p>(This kind of institutionalized corruption hearkens back to an earlier era: In the post-Soviet 1990s, the country saw a boom in criminal gangs, with police often functioning as their enforcers. While Ukrainian officials initiated a massive police overhaul in 2015 to address structural problems in the force, only 7.7% of officers lost their jobs. Most appealed their dismissals and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-is-ukraines-new-police-force/">were eventually reinstated</a>.</p>



<p>Safonov also acknowledges that there has been illegal collaboration between authorities and dealers, even recently. In one <a href="https://hromadske.ua/posts/kolishni-policejski-organizuvali-narkolaboratoriyu-na-kiyivshini">notable instance earlier this year</a>, former police officers were found operating a methadone and amphetamine lab in an industrial building on the outskirts of Kyiv. But, he insists, this was an exception for an otherwise by-the-book force: “Bad grass grows in every garden.”</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of who</strong> is selling, Telegram is, by design, extremely difficult to police. “With an end-to-end encrypted app, users can reasonably expect that investigators won’t be able to access their chats,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. While not all Telegram data is end-to-end encrypted, the company stores data in multiple centers controlled by different jurisdictions, to ensure that no government can access its systems. According to Pfefferkorn, “Companies such as Telegram and Signal intentionally minimize the amount of user metadata they store, precisely so that there is less that can be handed over to law enforcement if investigators come knocking.” (According to Telegram, while it will not interfere with private chats, it will block public channels it deems illegal, such as those belonging to terrorists and narcotraffickers.)</p>



<p>Even on an individual level, built-in accountability features can be easily circumvented. For instance, while each Telegram account must be …</p></div></div>

(This is a segÂ­ment in the midÂ­dle of the abÂ­stract; it can see all the preÂ­cedÂ­ing text, but Iâ€™m not viÂ­suÂ­alÂ­izÂ­ing the acÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tions for it.)</p><p>For readÂ­abilÂ­ity, Iâ€™ve made two plots showÂ­ing two conÂ­secÂ­uÂ­tive stretches of 10 toÂ­kens.

<p><em>[ NOTE: This post contains references to allegedly leaked information about upcoming versions of the game and, as such, should be viewed as a <strong>spoiler</strong> post. Be warned. ]</em></p>



<p>On June 5th, Hello Games updated the Steam (PC) Experimental Branch of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> with an update several gigabytes in size. (The Experimental Branch is a beta version of the game that Steam players can opt into in order to see the latest features and help Hello Games work out the kinks by providing feedback and bug reports.) The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/2299597907723043384/">patch notes</a> for this release say only:</p>



<ul><li>Replaced networking back end.</li><li>Upgraded to OpenVR 1.10.30.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM.png" alt="" width="411" height="94" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM.png 1756w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-300x70.png 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-768x178.png 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-604x140.png 604w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px"></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving this update, Experimental Branch players began seeing  little platform icons attached to players wandering around in the Anomaly (a networked area of the game). Hello Games also released this beta version of the game (or a similar version) for the Xbox One via the Xbox Insider Hub, a Microsoft service that allows users to opt into betas, akin to Steam’s beta option. Players on both platforms running these betas are seeing each other, with appropriate platform icon, in the Anomaly at the same time. This, along with a host of platform icons discovered in the beta release by data miners, clearly speaks to some level of cross-platform gameplay on the way. </p>



<p>Now, since May 19th we’ve known that new content of some sort was on the way, <a href="https://twitter.com/gregbuchanan/status/1262736368616108035">thanks to a tweet</a> from author / scriptwriter Greg Buchanan who was behind the (great) Artemis storyline from 2017’s <em>Atlas Rises</em> update to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. On May 29th, Hello Games posted the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2020/05/beyond-development-update-11/"><em>Beyond</em> Development Update 11 page</a> on their website, detailing a number of new things going on in the game, including mention of a content-related hiatus to the weekend missions. </p>



<blockquote><p>Beginning this weekend, there will be a short pause between seasons of weekend missions. These will be returning very soon, featuring new story content we’re really enjoying from one of the writers on Atlas Rises.</p></blockquote>



<p>(There actually <em>was</em><a href="https://nmsspot.com/2020/06/11/community-event-31-the-event-that-wasnt-sort-of-it-was-pretty-though/"> a mission this past weekend</a>, but it appears that it may have been a test of the new networking back end / cross-play and only visible to those running beta versions on Steam and Xbox One.)</p>



<p>The following day, <a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Yl78hxy.png">an anonymous post appeared</a> on 4chan (let me pass the salt) entitled “No Man’s Sky summer update leaked details.” Within, the poster claims that according to his/her source, a content update is imminent and that it will tease out details of what is to come in a larger summer update. I am not going to print all of the details that were mentioned, here, but will say that what caught my <em>particular</em> interest is the suggestion that this coming update is “heavily focused on pro[c]gen” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedural generation</a>), with the indication,</p>



<blockquote><p>…my source has told me that hello games have been working on ambitious things with their procgen and will improve terrain diversity and formations. new biomes will be introduced &amp; more “alien” planets.</p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, data mining efforts of <a href="https://twitter.com/ProceduralTRV">Procedural Traveller</a> on the June 5th PC Experimental release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8890itJ2-io">reveal several findings</a> that seem to backup the notion of new biomes on the way. (It is worth bearing in mind, however, that there are some items found in the data from even years past that have not come to fruition in the game.) Also, a number of mild visual / rendering changes have already been <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/2299597907723043384/">observed by myself</a> and others in the PC Experimental version. </p>



<p>The reason that this struck a chord with me is the fact that just last month, the patent for the “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news030331-3">Superformula</a>,” created by Belgian biologist Johan Gielis, expired. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="80" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1.jpg 960w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-300x64.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-768x164.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-604x129.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"><figcaption>The Superformula (image: Johan Gielis / Botanical Society of America)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Superformula is, as Gielis describes it, “A generic geometric transformation that unifies a wide range of natural and abstract shapes.” It is basically a modified take on an equation that describes a unit circle. The equation contains a number of variables and the geometric shape that it generates depends on the particular combination of values plugged into it. </p>



<p>Gielis was granted <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1177529B1">European</a> (in 2005) and<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7620527"> U.S.</a> (in 2009) patents on the Superformula, restricting its potential uses. Those that followed the development progress of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> leading up to its release may recall  Genicap, a Dutch company developing products and tech based on the Superformula, claiming that Hello Games was in violation of the patent with its procedural space exploration game. Forbes’ article, “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2016/07/27/no-mans-sky-superformula/#78844e122474">Did ‘No Man’s Sky’ Steal A Scientist’s Superformula?</a>,” dated July 27, 2016, details the claim and goes a long way towards explaining what the Superformula is. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/creature-640x640-1.png" alt="" width="376" height="210" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/creature-640x640-1.png 640w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/creature-640x640-1-300x168.png 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/creature-640x640-1-481x270.png 481w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px"></figure></div>



<p>The New Yorker article “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian">World Without End</a>” (May 11, 2015), takes an extraordinarily deep look at the genesis story and early development of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. One of the many anecdotes within the piece describes Hello Games lead Sean Murray, early on, using the Superformula to experiment with the creation of infinite organic shapes floating over a desert. That Murray, at some point, played with the formula seems to be the “proof” Genicap held on to in order to make their patent violation claim. Murray consistently denied that the Superformula was used in the development of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, and <strong>it seems the logical conclusion that Hello Games created their own procedural generation algorithms, perhaps <em>inspired</em> by Gielis’ formula, that were used in the game. </strong>(The Superformula, itself, being a modification of another existing formula.)</p>



<p>And the patents have just expired. </p>



<figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms.jpg"><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424.jpg 1424w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px"></a></figure>



<p>If the anonymous poster is correct and Hello Games is presently doing “ambitious things” with the game’s procedural generation (and “ambitious” is the only way you could describe the <em>current</em> game’s proc gen, so in context, that’s quite a statement), could they now be using the Superformula in conjunction with their own routines, or to extend their routines in certain ways? It’s hard to say. Perhaps HG’s routines are well beyond the Superformula, and it would be of little use to them at this point. That seems quite likely, in fact. But, one can only speculate. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild_big-1.jpg"><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="220" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild.jpg 850w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px"></a></figure></div>



<p>And, when it comes to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, my <em>favorite</em> area of speculation is precisely that of the procedural generation system. I have made frequent mention of <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2019/03/21/a-few-words-from-a-no-mans-sky-time-traveler/">my desire</a> for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to take back on a “wilder” aspect, the sort that characterized the early days of the game. (This is why <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2019/11/18/a-progress-update-from-a-no-mans-sky-time-traveler/">I am presently playing the 2016 <em>Foundation</em> 1.1 version</a> alongside the current <em>Beyond</em> release.) The best scenario I can picture would be a combination of the worlds we have had since the <em>NEXT</em> release, and a far wilder set of worlds harking back to the days of <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Path Finder</em>, and <em>Atlas Rises</em> — or, perhaps wilder still. </p>



<p>It is obviously the case that the “leaked” information, along with promises of what may actually grow out of the data mined details, need to be taken with a Faecium-sized chunk of salt. But…it seems there might <em>just</em> be a chance that I will get what I’ve been long hoping for. As always, time will tell.</p>

<p>My team has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a difference experience.</p>

                <p><small>September 1st</small></p>
<p>I do a lot of work with web build systems and performance, but I got into
writing software because I like making products. With all the free time that the
pandemic has brought, I’ve been spending my off-hours teaching myself to write
Swift instead of screaming into the void. I missed writing product code and I
missed writing a compiled language with a nice IDE and a type system. I also
missed the speed and responsiveness that comes with native code that you only
get in the browser if you are extremely careful. So, I decided to try and build
an iOS app in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>. This post is the first of a handful where I try to
digest what I’m working on. Think of this more as a journal than any sort of
tutorial.</p>
<h2>What are you making then?</h2>
<p>My goal is to make an app that will show me where I’ve been in New York on a
block-by-block basis. New York is big and I’ve only lived here for 5 years, so
an app that shows me where I’ve been might also show me what I’m missing.</p>

            <figcaption>I could have picked a smaller phone.</figcaption>
        </figure>
<p>From a technical perspective, I want to try and use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> to build
my app and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">Core Data</a> to persist its data. I also want to avoid 3rd
party libraries if possible. If, like me, you’re new to a lot of this, SwiftUI
is Apple’s new view framework, and Core Data is Apple’s built-in data
persistence layer. I won’t go into a ton of detail on these libraries in this
post, but a little context seems important. I figure these constraints will
force me to get experience with the core pieces of iOS development, which is
most of why I’m writing this app in the first place.</p>
<h2>Getting New York’s road data</h2>
<p>To start, I need to think about how I want this app to work. Ideally, I want to
break streets up into segments by block. I’m defining a block here as <strong>the
chunk of a street between any two adjacent intersections</strong>. For example,
Division Avenue between Berry Street and Bedford Avenue is a block, as is Berry
Street between Division Avenue and S 11th Street. To do this, I’ll need a way to
represent a road segment so that I can store metadata about it. I’ll also need
to know every possible road segment in New York so that I know what I have and
have not visited. Getting at this data turns out to be not so straightforward.</p>
<h3>Apple Maps</h3>
<p>I started by looking at what Apple would give me. When you want to render a map,
Apple provides you with a view. They also provide you with a way to search for
locations and a way to get directions between two locations.</p>
<p>However, there’s no way to get at any of the data directly. If I want the names
of roads nearby, or even the name of the road that’s closest to my location, I’m
out of luck. I needed to be able to get a catalog of road segments and identify
the closest one from wherever I am. This data takes a while to collect, and
anyone who’s collected enough of it isn’t willing to give it away, with the
except the beautiful people who maintain OpenStreetMap.</p>

            <figcaption>Not the prettiest map tiles, but definitely the free-est.</figcaption>
        </figure>
<h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is like Wikipedia for street data. It seemed like a natural
place to look since its data is free to use and is constantly being updated. The
reality is that map data is really, really big, and getting at the data for just
New York City is gross. OpenStreetMap lets you <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/40.7192/-73.9564&amp;layers=C">export</a> regions of
map data, but exporting an area bigger than that a square mile or so ends up
being too big a request for them to process. My options were either to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a lot of smaller regions and stitch them together.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">all of OpenStreetMap’s data</a> in one big ol’ file and
extract the data I needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as I didn’t know much about how to use this data, neither option seemed
especially great. On the bright side, there are a few third parties that <a href="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/NewYork/">will
extract data</a> from OpenStreetMap for popular regions like cities. I
ended up finding and downloading some of the data for New York City, which ended
up being extremely detailed. The data included road segments, neighborhood
names, building shapes, and everything else you might imagine needs to be
represented on a map. It was also about a gig and a half of JSON, and while this
level of detail is great, I only really needed data on roads.</p>
<h3>New York’s Centerline Data</h3>
<p>Around this time, I learned about New York City’s Open Data initiative. They
host a project called <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b">The NYC Street Centerline</a>, which holds data
about New York’s roadbeds. It’s a fantastic start, but it’s not as polished as
OpenStreetMap’s data. For example, take a look at this screenshot of NYC’s data
on top of Google Maps. The blue lines are roads rendered from Centerline data.
Note the discrepancies, especially around driveways, walking paths, and parking
lots.</p>

        </figure>
<p>It also appears to be missing a lot of data about roads through some parks and
cemeteries, which would be nice to know about. Here’s what Woodlawn Cemetery
looks like, for example:</p>

        </figure>
<p>I’m betting OpenStreetMap’s data is more accurate than NYC’s here, but NYC’s
data is a solid start. It’s exclusively road data, so the actual file size is
about ten times smaller than the OpenStreetMap data for New York. Plus, it comes
with a bunch of fun attributes, like how wide the road is, the street numbers on
each side, and even what priority the street gets when snow needs to be plowed.
I’m betting I’ll want to end up using OpenStreetMap at some point, but for now
this seems like a good way to get started.</p>
<h2>Making sense of a 134.5MB JSON file</h2>
<p>Centerline hosts their data in a bunch of different types of formats, but most
of them looked like they’d require extra parsing to make sense of, as though
they were all just created from dumps of a <a href="https://postgis.net/">geospatial database</a>. For
example, JSON-formatted data was a list of un-keyed data, with the road’s
coordinates encoded as a <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/geodatabase/10.0/sdk/arcsde/concepts/geometry/shapes/types.htm">Multilinestring</a> that would need
to be parsed:</p>

<p>However, they did offer their data hosted as <a href="https://geojson.org/">geoJson</a>, which is a
specification for encoding geodata as json (surprise). It’s a bit more verbose,
so the filesize is a bit bigger, but filesize is a bit less of a concern when
your data is already a hundred megabytes. In geoJson, that same road segment

<p>I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to open and explore this file. Getting
an understanding of its shape is a requirement if I wanted to parse it into any
sort of app, and to do that I needed to poke around. Opening the file in Xcode
caused it to crash pretty reliably. VSCode similarly hung for a while, and when
it finally responded a bunch of navigation features seemed to be disabled. To
help explore all of this data, I ended up using an app called
<a href="https://viewer.dadroit.com/">Dadroit</a>, a JSON viewer specifically made for viewing large files
quickly.</p>

<p>Using Dadroit gave me enough context on the shape of the data to be able to

got far enough into the data to be able to highlight a bunch of random roads
from it.</p>

					<div><p>Transcript:</p><p>Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host, Dr. McKayla. And today is a special episode. Yeah, the software engineering unlocked podcast turned one. And to celebrate the one year anniversary – and can you imagine it’s already one year – I thought I will tell you a little bit about myself.</p><p>I will very inline with the theme of the show, I will tell you a little bit about how I came into tech, a little bit about my experiences with different companies. And also I will tell you about my favorite topic code review. So yeah, let’s see how that goes. I’m a little bit nervous because it’s first not interview-style podcast episode. So it means that I don’t have another person interviewing me and asking me questions. So it will be all me talking. And I hope that this goes well, I don’t know. So yeah, about me. Well, where should I start? Maybe really from the beginning, like I do with my guests. So how did I actually come into tech?</p><p>You know, that’s&nbsp; quite a strange story, because I went to a high school, that was all about art. And while it’s way back then a computer were already a thing. I’m not that old, but, uh, at my school, we didn’t have laptops in our class. We didn’t write on a word for example, or some, um, word processor or something.</p><p>We rode really still with pencil on paper. And especially when I graduated the time were already advanced. So in other school, people were using computers and programs to type, and our school was an art school. And so we were not very progressed. Uh, our teachers also thought, you know, it’s, it’s not a good thing.</p><p>You know, writers write on paper. So even though when I graduated, I was still writing most of my stuff. Oh, really with pen and paper. And I had little to no exposure to computers. We had a computer at home, but because it’s, um, it was something expensive and it was something, you know, that also my parents were maybe a little bit afraid of, we were not allowed to just go and play with the computer or try things out.</p><p>So I really have to say my exposure to computers were really, it was really, really limited. Never ever would I have starting this year that I will study computer science, but I’m in the lab last year before graduating and before starting a university, I actually attended a few lectures at the university and I attended lectures in different areas.</p><p>So I was in one lecture about psychology. I was in an, um, lecture about physics and I was in the left. Sure. About algorithms. And somehow I was really hooked. I never, I actually thought I will study math. This is what I thought that I will go on. But then when, when I was in this lecture and this professor talked about distributed systems and threading problems, and he also were talking about cash machines.</p><p>And so I really could see the application of what very much looked like math to me and logic. But I could see really the impact that it has on the real world. Yeah. And so I think I was hooked. So I got a first book about it. And during the summer break, before starting university, I read this book, it was about really fundamentals.</p><p>What is an algorithm and what is computer science still? I didn’t touch any computers. Right. It was really theoretical knowledge about, you know, what computer science is all about. And there was really, really fascinating. I thought, this is what I want to do. And so when I made the decision and I said, I’m going to apply, my parents were not thrilled.</p><p>They were like, this is not for girls. And this is not for you. And you’re coming from an art background, which was very true. Right. I was mainly painting pictures. I drew, I had paintings and things like that, architecture, but, um, I was always good at math and. I decided, even though they weren’t happy and actually even said, they’re not going to really support me doing that.</p><p>I went ahead, add end. I’m enrolled. And the enrollment was actually online and yeah, mr. We failed to be honest. Yeah. I really failed to create an account. You know, dad. This was the current state that I was in. Right. So I got a little bit worried about, um, if I’m not even able to in role, because I had so little exposure to computers and internet and things like that.</p><p>We didn’t have internet at home. Um, How I’m gonna deal with that. But yeah, there was an it department, so they helped me actually enroll when I told them that I, they, I need some assistance with that and that I actually want to study computer science. They were also not super thrilled and I laughed a little bit about me, uh, but I managed to get the thing done with a little bit of help.</p><p>And, and then it was. It was really intense. I would say her first year, especially the first half year, really intense. Most of my, um, classmates, my colleagues at university had a lot of knowledge already became, um, most of them actually came from high schools that had like, uh, Focused on computers, even new houses program.</p><p>And for me, everything was new and I didn’t have really a computer and I didn’t have so much money. So I bought really a crappy computer and, um, it wasn’t good enough for, for example, the job compilers really run. So if I wanted to combine my hello world, the first program that I a road, it took several minutes, like 15 minutes.</p><p>It can you imagine? So. Um, I knew I had to do something else, so I try to collect a little bit more money and make more money. I worked on the side. And so, um, within the first two, three months I was able to buy a better computer. And, um, it wasn’t the best computer. Yeah. It was really nice. A nice laptop that, uh, got the job done.</p><p>Let’s put it that way. And also, I have to say that in my computer science education, especially at the beginning, we did again, a lot things on, um, Paper. I mean, we wrote Java programs on paper. Um, not always URI. I needed a computer and you were doing it at home, right? Well then transferring. Yeah. What you learned in class?</p><p>Um, To the computer. Uh, but yeah, so this is how I got started. And, um, I did the primer in programming that really helped a lot. It was very, very intense, but I, I studied a lot. Um, this is pure reality is that I really studied a lot and I really, you know, deep dive into that, I found it really also very, very fascinating.</p><p>So it wasn’t, wasn’t hard for me. And by the, by the end of the first year, I was one of the best in class. And, um, this was very encouraging as well. So I, I didn’t start really well. Uh, but yeah, based on learning a lot and really having an open mind and being so curious, I was able to, to level up. So is, it was really how I started.</p><p>Maybe I rambled a little bit too long, but hopefully found it interesting. And yeah, well I did then back then, actually, when I did my, my, my. Bachelor. There were no bachelor and masters in Austria. I did my, my, uh, university in Austria, but this was one five year program. And so in the middle of when I started, they actually changed the thing to master and bachelor, but because I already took master classes, um, in my bachelor’s, I then actually.</p><p>Uh, pursued the whole thing and did a bachelor in the master and the master. I did partly in London, in the vestments there university, and this was really one of my best times. It was the first time that I went away from home. And, uh, somehow I got a little bit hooked. I really left being away and learning about new cultures.</p><p>Um, having a complete different perspective on life, uh, through those travels through those months abroad. And so when I finished my masters, I knew that I’m not gonna stay. So I started actually as a lecturer, the university, and I teach the system security and complexity theory. Hmm. The algorithms. So something like that, introduction to algorithms.</p><p>Um, so, but I knew that I wanted something else. So I looked around and I found a PhD program. And I applied and it was actually in the Netherlands. And I also have to say that when I graduated, this was 2008, it was a regression. Right. So, uh, it wasn’t the best job market. And, uh, maybe, um, I don’t know if I would have done a PhD, if there would be a better job market I wanted to go into.</p><p>What I always wanted to do is industrial research. Right? So I wanted to be in industry and do the research side, but that bind, I think it was just not possible. There was no money and especially companies didn’t hire a lot of people into research, which somehow is not the most necessary thing. I think that if times are, you know, difficult, um, a lot of resources go away from, from research.</p><p>Anyway. So I went actually to the Netherlands and I did my PhD program there. Um, I was mainly looking at how people software system, so software comprehension, can we build models around. Large software systems, so that it’s easier to really know what’s happening here to get an overview. And I was also diving into testing.</p><p>So especially test systems when we are testing something, how do we know, how do we know what we should test? Which integrations for example, should we test? And I’m experimenting with things that help people really to understand their. Test suites, but another aspect of dad was God, more than more into qualitative studies.</p><p>So what I really enjoyed was doing this quantitative things. So like you’re looking at data you’re analyzing. Software repositories data that you’re getting from, uh, from what they, what the engineers produce. Right. So you’re looking at commits, you’re looking at the source code. You’re looking at, um, maybe interactions that engineers are having.</p><p>Right. But there’s in a, in a very quantitative way. Um, so you’re doing a lot of data mining there and, um, maybe. I have some algorithms around to extract entrance, interesting patterns, but then compliment that with a qualitative research. So instead of saying, well, we extracted, you know, let’s say to get history and then we saw, and we have some way to detect, let’s say …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts.

<h2>In The Beginning</h2>



<p>A little over 13 years ago, I had been working as a freelance developer for over five years, primarily writing and hosting Ruby based web sites and applications for a variety of commercial interests, from mutual funds to construction to education. </p>



<p>I had designed and built a reliable system architecture for deploying and managing dozens of disparate sites and applications. However, I frequently encountered an annoying logistical problem when I was diagnosing and debugging client issues. For both load handling and for redundancy purposes, many of these sites ran on two or more application server instances. This necessarily meant that there were two or more sets of logs being generated on different instances/machines.</p>



<p>If there were commercial log aggregator offerings at that time, I wasn’t aware of them, and for various reasons I didn’t like the idea of trying to use <a href="https://sematext.com/blog/log-aggregation/#toc-syslog-rsyslog-or-syslog-ng-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syslog</a> to fill the gap, so I chose to write my own solution. I did everything with Ruby, and I wasn’t afraid of the challenge of writing a Ruby based system that was both fast enough and reliable enough for this purpose, so I dove in and I hacked something out.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger" target="_blank">Analogger</a> was born.</p>



<h2>The Backstory</h2>



<p>Analogger was written using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/03/12/ruby-1-8-6-released/" target="_blank">Ruby 1.8.6</a>, and for high performance network IO, I used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine" target="_blank">EventMachine</a>, which provides an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern" target="_blank">event reactor</a> implemented with C++, with an interface to Ruby, that lets one write high speed IO/network handling code in Ruby. As part of the package, I also wrote a logging client, which used pure Ruby to send the messages, so that whatever was using the client (such as a Rails app) did not have to be running an EventMachine reactor to use it.</p>



<p>I didn’t do much with it after that. It just worked. I announced the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.engineyard.com/engine-yards-plans-for-ruby-1-8-6" target="_blank">Ruby 1.8.6 End-Of-Life</a> in 2011, but Analogger didn’t need much attention to adapt to later Rubies. Analogger just worked.</p>



<p>In my usage, at it’s peak, it handled millions of records a day, aggregating those logs into log files on a single dedicated logging instance. I fixed a few bugs here and there. I eventually made it available on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger" target="_blank">Github</a> and as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/analogger" target="_blank">gem</a>. I added a feature a few years ago so that one can avoid losing logging data if the server goes down. But mostly, I ignored it and just let it do it’s job. There was little that had to be done for it to work with newer Rubies as they were released, though the dependence on EventMachine meant that alternative Ruby implementations, such as JRuby, might not work so well (there has been a <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/tree/master/java/src/com/rubyeventmachine">Java implementation of EventMachine</a> for a long time, but it’s feature parity with the Ruby version often lagged). However, like so many other people do so often with software that is running in production without any problems, I mostly took the approach of, “If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.”</p>



<p>Fast forward to the present. I’m running Ruby 2.7.1. Rubygems is a first class citizen of the Ruby ecosystem. EventMachine is still around, and it’s still fast, but Ruby is faster now, too, and there are other ways to do things. There are also other interesting languages around like <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golang</a>, and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a>, and a compelling argument could be made that low level, performance sensitive software like Analogger might better be written in a language like that.</p>



<p>So, a few weeks ago when I was looking through the Analogger code with that in mind, and it occurred to me that before I embark on a complete rewrite, it would be prudent to just renovate Analogger for the Ruby 2.7.1 world. The biggest part of that is that I wanted to convert it from dependence on EventMachine to the use of the excellent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/socketry/async" target="_blank">Async</a> library.</p>



<h2>The Journey</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EventMachine</a> is great. It joined the Ruby ecosystem a long time ago, and it still sees regular use. That alone should be testimony to it’s utility and its performance. However, Ruby itself now has a much richer ecosystem surrounding it, which provides us with more options, and more choices.</p>



<p>Analogger is an asynchronous logger written around an event reactor. There is no reason that reactor can not itself be implemented primarily in Ruby.</p>



<p>Back at the end of 2011, <a href="https://github.com/tarcieri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Acieri</a> started writing <a href="https://github.com/socketry/nio4r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nio4r</a>. It was modeled after Java’s NIO (Nonblocking IO). Taken from the current github page for the project:</p>


<pre title="">New I/O for Ruby (nio4r): cross-platform asynchronous I/O
primitives for scalable network clients and servers. Modeled
after the Java NIO API, but simplified for ease-of-use.

nio4r provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful I/O
selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
"reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects
for various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
</pre>


<p>About three years ago <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Williams</a> started working on <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Async</a>, which is an event reactor implementation in Ruby, leveraging Nio4r. It is intentionally simple, with several companion projects that provide other capabilities such as IO, HTTP handling, process management, websockets, etc.</p>



<p>For the purposes of the renovation of Analogger, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async-io</a> seems like the state of the art in Ruby event reactors, so let’s refactor the codebase to use it.</p>



<p>With EventMachine, the core of the usage is this:</p>


<pre title="">EventMachine.run {
  EventMachine.add_shutdown_hook do
    write_queue
    flush_queue
    cleanup
  end
  @server = EventMachine.start_server @config[-"host"], @config[-"port"], protocol
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(1) {Analogger.update_now}
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(@config[-"interval"]) {write_queue}
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(@config[-"syncinterval"]) {flush_queue}
}
</pre>


<p>In this code, <code>protocol</code> is a class that implements the network protocol, using EventMachine methods.</p>



<p>To convert the code to using Async (specifically, Async-IO), we remove EventMachine from the gemspec and add Async:</p>


<pre title="">spec.add_runtime_dependency 'async-io', '~&gt; 1.29'
</pre>


<p>Async offers some signal handling tools that EventMachine did not offer. In the original EventMachine based code, the following helper method was implemented:</p>


<pre title="">def safe_trap(siglist, &amp;operation)
  (Signal.list.keys &amp; siglist).each {|sig| trap(sig, &amp;operation)}
end
</pre>


<p>It’s usage was something like this:</p>


<pre title="">EXIT_SIGNALS = %w[INT TERM]
safe_trap(EXIT_SIGNALS) {handle_pending_and_exit}
</pre>


<p>Async’s signal handling is aware of the reactor event loop, and is written to interact with it. In order to keep the code within the Async event loop looking clean, helper methods for each of the signal handlers needed to be written. They follow this pattern:</p>


<pre title="">def install_hup_trap(task: nil)
  hup_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:HUP)
  hup_trap.install!
  task.async do |_handler_task|
    loop do
      hup_trap.wait
      cleanup_and_reopen
    end
  end
end
</pre>


<p>This handler, for the <code>HUP</code> signal, instructs Analogger to sync any data that may still be in buffers out to its logfiles, and then to close and reopen all of them. With Async, since everything is being handled from inside of a reactor event loop, there are two interesting things that happen here.</p>


<pre title="">  hup_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:HUP)
  hup_trap.install!
</pre>


<p>This creates a signal handler, and then installs it.</p>


<pre title="">  task.async do |_handler_task|
    loop do
      hup_trap.wait
      cleanup_and_reopen
    end
  end
</pre>


<p>This creates a task. Async leverages <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Fiber.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruby fibers</a> to encapsulate discrete units of execution, and the Task essentially wraps that Fiber with a state management framework.</p>



<p>This code looks like it would just run in a tight loop, calling <code>cleanup_and_reopen</code> over and over. However, the call to <code>hup_trap.wait</code> changes that. The <code>hup_trap.wait</code> causes that fiber to cease executing and passes control back to the reactor. The signal handler encapsulated in the instance of <code>Async::IO::Trap</code> that was created for the <code>HUP</code> signal, if it is triggered by catching such a signal, will tell the reactor that this fiber should be scheduled again. As soon as the reactor is free to do so, it will resume the fiber’s execution at that point, allowing the loop to continue. When the loop restarts, the fiber will yield it’s execution once again. In this way the signal handler remains active and available to handle any number of <code>HUP</code> signals.</p>



<p>Similar methods were created for handling the <code>USR2</code> signal, which Analogger responds to by completely restarting itself, and the <code>INT</code> and <code>TERM</code> signals, which both cause Analogger to shut down gracefully, except in those methods, because the respective signals will only be handled a single time, they do not sit within a loop.</p>


<pre title="">def install_int_term_trap(task: nil, server: nil)
  int_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:INT)
  term_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:TERM)
  [int_trap, term_trap].each do |trap|
    trap.install!
    task.async do |_handler_task|
      trap.wait

      write_queue if any_in_queue?
      flush_queue
      cleanup
      trap.default!
      Async.logger.info(server) do |buffer|
        buffer.puts "Caught #{trap}"
        buffer.puts 'Stopping all tasks...'
        task.print_hierarchy(buffer)
        buffer.puts '', 'Reactor Hierarchy'
        task.reactor.print_hierarchy(buffer)
      end
      task.stop
    end
  end
end
</pre>


<p>Because this is renovation, the handler also takes advantage of some nice introspection capabilities that exist in Async to output a snapshot of the Reactor internals when it is stopped. This feature doesn’t exist with EventMachine, and it isn’t a <em>functional</em> feature, in that it doesn’t alter the core capabilities of the software in any way, but it is nice because it lets one see what tasks were currently in the system when it was stopped.</p>



<p>Analogger uses several timers, which are blocks of code that get executed either once, or repeatedly, after a given interval, to trigger actions that should occur at periodic intervals (such as ensuring that all logs that may exist in memory buffers are flushed to disk). EventMachine offers some nice syntactic sugar for implementing timers.</p>



<p>Async doesn’t offer any built in sugar for doing this, but timers are simple to implement within a reactor.</p>

It uses symbolic computations to find the defects. Analyzer covers a variety of checks targeted at finding security and API usage bugs, dead code, null dereference, division by zero, and other logic errors. The Clang Static Analyzer already has a checker to find the null pointer dereference in code, however it is not sufficient for higher abstractions such as C++ smart pointers or optionals. By explicitly teaching the C++ standard class behaviors we can make the Analyzer to find more bugs related to modern C++ code.<h2 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h2>Enable Clang Static Analyzer to find the occurrences of null smart pointer dereferences by teaching the observed behaviors of C++ smart pointer classes. Improve the analyzer’s ability to realize the values of the standard smart pointers without having to dig deep into the complex implementation details. We should be able to find more null dereference bugs related to the smart pointers while reducing the number of false positives. Should be able to cover at least one class fully eg. <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, and then extend it to <code>std::shared_ptr</code> or the <code>std::optional</code> if time permits. <h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>Within the GSoC time period, we could not implement the modeling for all smart pointer methods and operators as we planned. Since the problem was more complicated than what we all anticipated. So far the majority of the modeling for std::unique_ptr is  implemented and committed. We were able to find some promising results with that. We found <strong>8</strong> true positive warnings related to smart pointer null dereference in <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" target="_blank" rel="external">LLVM</a> project and <strong>5</strong> warnings in the <a href="https://webkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebKit</a> project. Even though we were only able to support <code>std::unique_ptr</code> so far, we accomplished to build a base modeling for the smart pointer checkers. And this will act as a consolidated foundation for developing checkers for any C++ objects that are passed by value. That is one of the first conscious attempts to do so and we’ve gained a lot of experience and managed to maintain our integrity - in the sense that the code ended up mostly free of hacks. It could most likely be generalized to modeling the entire C++ standard library. This does not give us the high-level architecture that’ll be needed to deal with the scale of the standard library, but we got our low-level basics right. Also this work will be used to add support for checking other smart pointers <code>std::shard_ptr</code>, <code>std::weak_ptr</code> as well as <code>std::optionals</code>. Also it can be used to build a checker for use-after-free errors. <h2 id="Research"><a href="#Research" title="Research"></a>Research</h2><h3 id="Smart-Pointer"><a href="#Smart-Pointer" title="Smart Pointer"></a>Smart Pointer</h3>A Smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer with additional automatic memory management. It manages a dynamically allocated object and ensures the dynamically allocated object is properly cleaned up. Such features are intended to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of pointers while retaining efficiency. Smart pointers typically keep track of the memory they point to, and may also be used to manage other resources, such as network connections and file handles.<h3 id="Unique-Pointer"><a href="#Unique-Pointer" title="Unique Pointer"></a>Unique Pointer</h3>A <code>unique_ptr</code> is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes that object when the <code>unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope. It should be used to own and manage any dynamically allocated object when its ownership is not shared. A <code>unique_ptr</code> explicitly prevents copying of its contained pointer (as would happen with the normal assignment), but the move assignment and move constructor can be used to transfer ownership of the contained pointer to another <code>unique_ptr</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: 1 Dereferencing default-constructed unique pointer which is null</strong><br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(<span>bool</span> flag)</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; x; </p><p><span>if</span> (flag) </p><p><span>return</span> <span>0</span>; </p><p><span>return</span> *x;  </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p><strong>Example: 2 Dereferencing a unique pointer after calling release()</strong><br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; x(<span>new</span> <span>int</span>(<span>42</span>)) ;  </p><p>  x.release(); </p><p><span>return</span> *x;   </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p>Similar to above cases, other possible cases are dereferencing after calling <code>std::move()</code>, <code>reset()</code> or <code>reset(nullptr)</code>, getting and explicitly deleting inner pointer, or swapping with null pointer using <code>std::swap</code> (<a href="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/#Appendix">more examples in Appendix</a>). Above all cases will result in a crash.</p>
<h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>The basic idea of the checker is to keep a record of raw pointers wrapped inside the smart pointers using a map between smart pointer and corresponding inner pointer. Update the map by enumerating all situations when the smart pointer becomes null, as well as the situations when the smart pointer becomes non-null. For example when a smart pointer is default constructed track that smart pointer as it has a null inner pointer. Then check if any of the tracked pointers dereferenced has a null value. To make the bug report more clear attach additional details along the bug path to provide more detailed information on where the smart pointer becomes null.</p>
<h2 id="Alternative-Solution-Considered"><a href="#Alternative-Solution-Considered" title="Alternative Solution Considered"></a>Alternative Solution Considered</h2><p>Another possible solution considered was manipulating symbolic values inside the smart pointer. The limitation that we run into here is that our memory model (“RegionStore”) doesn’t currently allow setting a “default” binding to a whole object when it’s a part (say, a field) of a bigger object. This means that we have to understand how the smart pointer works internally (which field corresponds to what) to manipulate its symbolic value, which ties us to a specific implementation of the C++ standard library. This might still work for a unique pointer which probably always has exactly one field, but for shared pointers it is not the case and has multiple fields. So it depends on the different implementations of the C++ standard library. It has been decided to not go with this approach since this approach is challenging and potentially a lot of work compared to the first approach.</p>
<h2 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h2><h3 id="Initial-Smart-Pointer-Modeling-and-Checker"><a href="#Initial-Smart-Pointer-Modeling-and-Checker" title="Initial Smart Pointer Modeling and Checker"></a>Initial Smart Pointer Modeling and Checker</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D81315" target="_blank" rel="external">D81315</a>: Created a basic implementation. </p>
<ul>
<li>Made a separate checker class for emitting diagnostics. Used the new checker to use <code>checkPreCall</code> and put bug reporting logic there.</li>
<li>Kept all smart pointer related modeling logic in <code>SmartPtrModeling</code>. Shared common functionality via a header file shared between the <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> and <code>SmartPtrChecker</code>. </li>
<li>Made a <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> as a dependency to <code>SmartPtrChecker</code>.</li>
<li>Introduced a GDM with <code>MemRegion</code> as key and <code>SVal</code> as value to track the smart pointer and corresponding inner pointer.  </li>
<li>Also added support to model <code>unique_ptr</code> constructor, release and reset methods.</li>
<li>Used <code>evalCall</code> to handle modeling. As part of this enabled constructor support in <code>evalCall</code> event with <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D82256" target="_blank" rel="external">D82256</a>. </li>
<li>Implemented <code>checkDeadSymbols</code> to clean up the <code>MemRegion</code> of smart pointers from the program state map when they go out of scope. Keeping the data structures in the program state as minimal as possible so that it would not grow to a great size while analyzing real code and eventually slows down the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this patch, the model can emit warnings for cases like use after default constructor, use after release, or use after the reset with a null pointer. Kept the <code>SmartPtrChecker</code> under <em>alpha.cplusplus</em> package and smart pointer modeling have to be enabled by the <code>ModelSmartPtrDereference</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="checkRegionChanges-for-SmartPtrModeling"><a href="#checkRegionChanges-for-SmartPtrModeling" title="checkRegionChanges for SmartPtrModeling"></a>checkRegionChanges for SmartPtrModeling</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D83836" target="_blank" rel="external">D83836</a>: Implemented <code>checkRegionChanges</code> for <code>SmartPtrModeling</code>. To improve the accuracy, when a smart pointer is passed by a non-const reference into a function, removed the tracked region data. Since it is not sure what happens to the smart pointer inside the function.<br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; P; </p><p>  bar(&amp;P); </p><p><span>return</span> *P; </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p>For example here in the code above, we are passing a default constructed <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ to method <code>bar()</code>. But it is unknown whether the <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ is reset with a valid inner pointer or not inside <code>bar()</code>. To avoid false positives we are not producing any warning on dereference of <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ after <code>bar()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unique-ptr-swap-method"><a href="#Modeling-for-unique-ptr-swap-method" title="Modeling for unique_ptr::swap method"></a>Modeling for unique_ptr::swap method</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D83877" target="_blank" rel="external">D83877</a>: Enabled the <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> to handle the swap method for <code>unique_ptr</code>. The <code>swap()</code> method can be used to exchange ownership of inner pointers between the <code>unique_ptrs</code>. So it is possible to make a <code>unique_ptr</code> null by swapping with another null <code>unique_ptr</code>. With this patch warnings are emitted when a <code>unique_ptr</code> is used after swapping with another <code>unique_ptr</code> with null as an inner pointer.</p>
<h3 id="NoteTag-for-better-reporting"><a href="#NoteTag-for-better-reporting" title="NoteTag for better reporting"></a>NoteTag for better reporting</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D84600" target="_blank" rel="external">D84600</a>: With NoteTags added more detailed information on where the smart pointer becomes null in the bug path. Introduced a <code>getNullDereferenceBugType()</code> inter-checker API to check if the bug type is interesting.<br><em>After adding NoteTags:</em><br><img src="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/notetag.png" alt="alt text" title="NoteTags"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unque-ptr-get"><a href="#Modeling-for-unque-ptr-get" title="Modeling for unque_ptr::get()"></a>Modeling for unque_ptr::get()</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D86029" target="_blank" rel="external">D86029</a>: Modeled to return tracked inner pointer for the <code>get()</code> method. The <code>get()</code> method is used to access the inner pointer. When the inner pointer is used with conditional branching or other symbol constraining methods we can use the constraints on the inner pointer to find whether the corresponding <code>unique_ptr</code> is null or not. When the inner pointer value for a <code>unique_ptr</code> is available from the tracked map we bind that value to the return value of <code>get()</code> method. Also made changes to create <code>conjureSymbolVal</code> in case of missing inner pointer value for a <code>unique_ptr</code> region we are tracking.<br><em>Example:</em><br><img src="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/get.png" alt="alt text" title="Get"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unique-ptr-bool-conversion"><a href="#Modeling-for-unique-ptr-bool-conversion" title="Modeling for unique_ptr bool conversion"></a>Modeling for unique_ptr bool conversion</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D86027" target="_blank" rel="external">D86027</a>: Modeling the case where <code>unique_ptr</code> is explicitly converted to bool. It is a common practice to check if a <code>unique_ptr</code> is null or not before accessing it. If the inner pointer value is already tracked and we know the value, we can figure out the corresponding boolean value. And the analyzer will take the branch based on that. Using <code>SValBuilder::conjureSymbolVal</code> to create a symbol when there is no symbol tracked yet and we constrain on that symbol to split the Exploded Graph with assuming null and non-null value.</p></div></div></div></article></div>

								<p>The recent years have seen a renewed interest in the choice of programming language in the development of important/critical software. There is increased realization that some programming languages come with pitfalls that impact the quality of the software produced in that language, with direct consequences for safety and security. This was the main message of the presentation by ANSSI on "Mind your language(s), A Discussion about Languages and Security" at HIS 2014. This is now a mainstream topic of discussion. Looking beyond mere pitfalls, some programming languages contain at their core a few "defect attractors", a term coined by Les Hatton and popularized by Eric Raymond, which defeat attempts at higher software quality. C is a hugely popular programming language for developing important/critical software, in particular embedded software, that has a high number of defect attractors: pointer arithmetic, type punning, manual memory management, text-substitution macros, global variables, manual error handling, implicit type conversions, minimality of syntax. In this presentation, we will discuss major defect attractors in mainstream programming languages such as C/C++, and how they are avoided in well established programming lanugages (such as Ada/OCaml), more recent programming languages (such as Rust/Go), new versions of programming languages (such as C++17/C++20) or subsets of programming languages (such as MISRA-C/SPARK Ada). We will highlight whether the defense comes from language constructs, supporting tools, or a combination thereof.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s bloody hard to find a good example of a large production-grade, open-source React app.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>No one</b> writes amazing code the first time they write it</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced product engineers know there’s a trade-off between quality and getting features in the hands of customers. You’re more likely to find ugly tech debt with a <code>//TODO: Improve this later!</code> comment than best practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most companies keep their apps in private repos</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade secrets and all that jazz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s a <em>lot</em> of beginner-grade repos out there</p>
<ul>
<li>Without a ton of experience, it’s hard to tell the good from the bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, I’ve reviewed the following well-known open-source React apps, and reckon they’re worth checking out.</p>

<p>Jira Clone is… a Jira clone built in modern React, entirely out of functional components with Hooks. It’s noteworthy because its stack is more or less what I’d use on my own side-projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript with TypeORM on the backend, communicating with a Postgres database</li>
<li>React on the frontend with a custom webpack config</li>
<li>Relies on Cypress for end-to-end testing</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, the author has done an amazing job making it look very similar to Jira (when the clone was built), using a mix of <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> and global styles.</p>
<p>This repo also highlights the benefits of just working on a project by yourself with a clear understanding of what you’re trying to build. You’ll see the contrast when you check out the other projects in this article.</p>

<p>RealWorld by Thinkster re-implements the same app (a Medium.com clone called Conduit) in over 24 different languages and frameworks. In this case, we’re reviewing the React/Redux version.</p>
<p>It uses create-react-app, with react-router for routing, Redux for state management, classNames for styling, superagent for data fetching, with no testing, or type-checking.</p>
<p>It seems like a decent way to understand the syntactical differences between dozens of language and framework combinations, but isn’t exactly a beacon of best practices.</p>

<p>Real World App is a great example of best-practices to use for end-to-end testing an application with Cypress, with example data in the repo, so both tests and the app run out-of-the-box without the need for a database.</p>
<p>It’s built with create-react-app, written in TypeScript with an Express backend, using Material UI as a UI/component library, Formik for forms, and react-router for routing.</p>
<p>It looks like a pretty solid example of an application you would see in the real world, (especially since it uses forms), though data-fetching and form submission are optimised for ease of testing/portability rather than best practices.</p>

<p>AST Explorer is a tool for exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Trees</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth checking out as a React project because it’s a good example of a project under continuous development for several years. It’s a classic React project that uses PropTypes for type-checking, and Redux for state management while still using local state where possible.</p>
<p>While you won’t find anything fancy like TypeScript/Flow here, the code is well commented, with hacks and workarounds clearly pointed out.</p>
<p>Some might say there’s some “tech debt”, as the authors have chosen to stick with class components, and not immediately rewrite to functional components + Hooks. Instead, they’ve maintained class components in older files, with functional components + Hooks in newer files.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, that like many real life, open-source projects, AST Explorer was started with the intention of adding tests later, but only one contributor in four years mentioned wanting to add tests in the GitHub Issues.</p>

<p>Excalidraw is a tool for drawing flow-charts, and various other diagrams with a hand-drawn style. I actually use it quite a bit for my own projects.</p>
<p>It’s worth checking out because it’s one of the most popular (in terms of daily users) examples of an un-ejected <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a> application I’ve seen in production.</p>
<p>It’s written in relatively modern React (mostly functional components with Hooks) with TypeScript, uses SCSS for styles, there are tests, and rather than using Redux, they’ve <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">lifted state up</a> and persisted it in localStorage.</p>

<p>Spectrum is a community site, seeking to combine the features of a real-time chat app with the features of forums. It’s been under active development since early 2017, and was acquired by GitHub at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Spectrum was very interesting to follow during its early years, as it used RethinkDB for (almost) live updates on queries, server-side rendering and GraphQL (very cutting edge at the time).</p>
<p>The codebase uses Flow for type-checking, Apollo (GraphQL) for data-fetching, Redux for state management, an <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/blob/alpha/hyperion/index.js">Express server</a> for server-side rendering, and uses functional components + Hooks, with custom hooks <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/tree/alpha/src/hooks">here</a>. Naturally, as one of the founders is <a href="https://mxstbr.com/">Max Stoiber</a> (creator of styled-components), the app is styled with styled-components.</p>
<p>Since the acquistion, Max has written a post called <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tech-choice-regrets-at-spectrum">Tech Choices I Regret at Spectrum</a> that’s also worth checking out.</p>

<p>It runs on a Django backend, with a React frontend written in TypeScript (with PropTypes too), uses <a href="http://emotion.sh/">Emotion</a> for styling, react-router for routing, Redux for state management, and is a great example of trade-offs and <code>//TODO</code> comments in a SaaS app with users that pay for it.</p>

<p>I almost didn’t add Grafana as an example here, since it’s an AngularJS project in the process of migrating to React.</p>
<p>It’s an AngularJS app being progressively rewritten into a modern React app, written in TypeScript. It uses Redux for state management, an internal design system that uses emotion for styling (<code>@grafana/ui</code>).</p>
<p>It’s kind of a nightmare to navigate as a codebase, mainly due to mixing folders only used by AngularJS with folders only used by React, and that’s exactly why it’s in this article, as an example of what you’ll see in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div> <p>In any organization, there will be people who behave inappropriately, sometimes grievously so. Here’s the paradox: the more senior the role you’re in, and the more power you have to help coworkers who are facing awful behavior like harassment or bullying, the less likely you are to see those things.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you’re in a position of power at work, you’re unlikely to see workplace harassment in front of you. That’s because harassment and bullying are attempts to exert power over people with less of it. People who behave improperly don’t tend to do so with people they perceive as having power already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was younger and in more junior roles, I dealt with harassment all the time. It was a defining characteristic of several jobs I had. What stands out in my memory from those roles isn’t what I learned or how I grew, but how hard I worked to avoid the men (it was always men) who made me feel meek and small. But over time, as I’ve moved up in my career, harassment has become steadily less prevalent in my work life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I was on the executive team of an org that employed around 250 people, nearly all of whom seemed very lovely to me, I wondered if perhaps I had found a group of people that simply didn’t include any bad apples. Spoiler alert: I had not.</p>
<p>Some months into the job, somebody made an offhand comment in front of me about a mid-level designer – a man in his 30s who was, apparently, well known for making young women in the organization feel uncomfortable. Let’s call this man Peter. Peter was also the first person to invite me out for coffee on my first day on the job. I had thought it a little curious at the time, since our work wasn’t going to overlap much. But he had been very friendly, sharing almost too much information about past problems at the org. I hadn’t thought too much of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until months later that I heard Peter described by a junior employee in a tone of voice that suggested everyone knew he was a problem. It was as if I’d stepped out of the Matrix and could now see reality. Suddenly, I understood why he had sought to establish a relationship with me early on. I was going to have power in the org, and he wanted that power to view him favorably. I also realized that most or all of the other people at my level – the very people who could do the most to address Peter’s behavior – likely didn’t know what everyone else thought was common knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine it: a majority of people at the company know or have a feeling that something is wrong. Everyone they talk to regularly knows it, too. Nobody among them thinks to discuss it with the most senior people, because as far as they can tell, everyone knows. And if the senior team isn’t doing anything, they must not care. Indeed, it probably isn’t safe to raise the issue with them because they all seem friendly with Peter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point in my career, I had spent a lot of time working on diversity, equity and inclusion. I had an undergrad degree in gender studies, and I was quite aware of organizational dynamics and structural oppression; I was on the path that I remain on to understand and use my advantages as a White person to change the workplace. And yet, I was stunned to realize that I had passively become a reinforcing part of the very type of harassment that I had struggled with for years. That was not the last surprise.</p>
<p>In my current job, I recently posted about this dynamic in a public Slack channel. Two of my colleagues – cis, White, middle-aged men who manage managers – reached out to me individually to say that they were glad I was talking about this, because they didn’t know what harassment looked like, and they wanted to learn so they could watch out for it. One of them said simply, ‘I’ve been a straight white guy my whole life. Nobody harasses me.’</p>
<p>I was pushed through the Matrix again. Not only was it possible that people in senior leadership positions at work had never been harassed, it was also possible that they didn’t even know what it looked or felt like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So what does harassment look and feel like?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Harassment is, unfortunately, a big category (and some of this discussion might be triggering). You are probably aware of the legal guidelines here, which prohibit quid pro quo (e.g. ‘I’ll give you a raise if you sleep with me’) and create a hostile environment (e.g. bullying people or teasing them in a demeaning way). Often, though, harassment and bullying fall somewhere in between these things. To people experiencing these things, they might look like, among many other things:</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted invitations.</strong>&nbsp;Asking a coworker to join you for drinks, dinner, or even lunch, especially after they’ve already said no.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted attention.</strong>&nbsp;Commenting on a coworker’s appearance i.e., clothing, hair, makeup, or body.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted touching.&nbsp;</strong>Slightly prolonged taps, feeling somebody’s hair, hugging. Even a few years ago, hugging at work was common in some workplaces. That’s less the case now, both because it can shade into harassment and also because it’s more widely understood that some neurotypes find any kind of touching uncomfortable.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted online interactions.</strong>&nbsp;Sliding into somebody’s DMs with suggestive emojis or sending flirtatious emails.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><a data-gc-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups."><strong>Microaggressions of all types</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Although I’m using it broadly here, the term was originally coined in 1970 to describe racist comments, specifically. Notably, in his recent book,&nbsp;<em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, Ibram X. Kendi rejects the term, in part because, ‘A persistent daily hum of racist abuse is not minor…I use the term “abuse” because that describes the action and its effects on people.’</li>
</ul><p>Again, it’s critical to understand that harassment and bullying are expressions of power, so the perpetrator has status over the person they’re targeting: either from the org chart or from social systems like patriarchy and White supremacy. In other words, a White peer can abuse a Black coworker, an able-bodied peer can harass a disabled coworker, and so forth. It doesn’t require a senior title, though that almost always increases the impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That impact is significant. If you’re in a position of societal or organizational power, these behaviors may seem small; if you’re lower in power, they can be devastating, causing people to question their own actions and worth. People who have to field these behaviors in a workplace are, at a very minimum, distracted and drained. Depression is common, and even suicide is a possible result. The fact that the patterns may be hidden from you does not make them less significant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having shared that glimpse of what harassment is, I’m going to talk about what we – the leaders in our organizations – can do to become aware of it, and how we can tell if our actions are effective. Because we can’t take action if we don’t realize bad behavior surrounds us, I’m going to focus on creating the conditions for awareness, not on actually addressing harassment or bullying. Once you become aware, you can work with other leaders to address it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are five things I’ve done to make it easier for people to talk with me about behavior that’s hidden from me.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">A few times a year, I post a public message in Slack about how I used to experience harassment all the time, but now I rarely see it at all because of my title. So even though I’m more likely in a position to help, I need other people’s help to understand what’s happening. I post infrequently enough that people pay attention, but often enough that new people get the message.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I’m unsurprised when I hear that somebody with social power who is very friendly to me has been causing problems for other people. In other words, I believe the stories of marginalized and underrepresented people over my own experience. (This is hard!)</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I hold skip-level meetings at least quarterly, so that everyone who reports up to me knows who I am and that my door is open.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I welcome and cultivate professional 1:1 relationships with younger people who don’t report to me. They’re often aware of problems in the organization and need support outside their reporting chain to figure out how to speak up.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I talk often about inequity. Being vocal about it is a signal to people throughout the organization about the values I hold and the culture I’m aiming to help create.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2>How do you know if any of this is working?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are a few signs I look for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization seeking me out to talk about uncomfortable things? For example, are they coming to me because they think they’re being underpaid but don’t know how to ask their manager for a raise? Are they coming to me because they’re worried that their work is suffering due to a recent breakup and they don’t know if they should tell their team lead? When these conversations come up, it’s likely that I’ve built some trust with people who don’t report directly to me or aren’t in my reporting chain at all.</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization coming to me because they’ve heard I’m good to talk with? That’s often a sign that I’m developing a reputation for having perspective beyond my own experience. (It’s worth noting that I’m not universally helpful. None of us can be good for everyone to talk with.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the people who report to me bringing up power dynamics on their teams so that we can talk through potential issues? That suggests they know that I care about power dynamics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves: are people talking to me about harassment or bullying they see or experience? And we have to understand that if they are not, that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. Instead, it means you don’t know about something very vital that is almost certainly happening around you all the time. If you aren’t hearing about it, it’s time to take action to ensure that you do.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yet another blog about docker that could be found in documentations, you might think. Legit opinion. But this is <strong>for those who don't want to be pointed to the bunch of documentation</strong>. And for those who would like to have some real use case in front of them when learning new concepts.</p>
<p>It's for beginners. So for those who heard about docker but never tried them. For those who heard their colleagues talking about it, but felt insecure to even ask how does it work. I might turn this into series of articles, we will see.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-dev-scenario-postgresql-on-your-next-project">Real life dev scenario - PostgreSQL on your next project</h2>
<p>Let's make a scene. Not the drama scene, but just to relax our mind a bit. This is not a post where you are presented a bunch of commands that's it. This should have a soul 😊.</p>
<p>You found out that your next project will involve, say, PostgreSQL. You never worked with it, you want to see how it looks like, and to prepare yourself for that project. Also, you already have a local machine set up for the current project. with totally different technologies. You don’t want to make more "mess". </p>
<h2 id="docker-hub">Docker Hub</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> will be your starting point in many cases, so let’s write a few words about it. We will use it also in this workshop to find images we need. It’s also a place where images are documented, so you’ll probably come back here many times.</p>
<p>Also, a tip for the future, start asking yourself <em>"Does XYZ have a docker image I can use?"</em>. Open it now and try searching some images, for example, <code>mysql, wordpress, ghost, elasticsearch, php, java, maven, gradle, python</code>. You see my point? You can find almost anything as a docker image.</p>
<p>You may notice this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">OFFICIAL IMAGE</a> mark. That means the people who developed that technology, are most likely involved in developing and maintaining the docker image. There are other advantages, of course, check the documentation.</p>
<p>But it’s ok to use unofficial ones, too. Especially if you are experimenting with something. For example, my colleagues were developing an app in <code>React Native</code>. I didn’t have anything setup for compiling React Native project. All I wanted was to build an <code>APK</code> file and use it on my mobile phone. So I’ve just pulled the unofficial image that has everything installed there. Built my APK file and that’s it.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough for Docker Hub. Lets' move on.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>The first step is to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=postgres&amp;type=image">Postgres image on Docker Hub</a>. This is the link, but feel free to go there and search it directly. </p>
<p>If you take a look at the description, you’ll see the supported tags and respective <code>Dockerfile</code> links. Consider tag as a version for the moment. There is also a whole tab dedicated to TAGS where you can find all the tags of this image. But the ones in the Description tab are supported ones. At the moment, supported tags go back down to version <code>9.5.22</code>. Also, versions in the tag are very likely to represent the version of the technology in the image. For example, <code>Python</code> image tagged as <code>3.6.8- stretch</code> will have <code>Python v3.6.8</code> in it. I’ll explain this <code>stretch</code> later.</p>
<p>OK, now we want to get a <code>Postgres</code> image. As this blog is static, we will stick with the version <code>11.8</code>. Postgres meanwhile released another tags, but for the sake of the blog we will use the <code>version 11</code>. The blog was tested with the version <code>11.2</code>, so we should stick with the major version 11.</p>
<p>There are two groups of tags, you may notice</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
11<span>.8</span>, 11
11<span>.8-alpine</span>, 11<span>-alpine</span>
</code></pre><p>You may wonder what’s the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s pull both of them with commands below, and I’ll explain a bit while you wait for them to download. Yes, actually stop reading the blog and execute these two commands, one after another.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>
$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>-alpine
</code></pre>
<p>OK, as you might see in browser (on the Ducker Hub page), each tag in one line links to the same <code>Dockerfile</code>. So it doesn’t matter if you are using <code>11.8</code> or <code>11</code>. At the moment of writing the initial blog article, in this line there was also a <code>latest</code> tag. The <code>latest</code> version back at the time was <code>11</code>. Now the latest is moved to the <code>version 12</code>. There are also beta versions 13 which will eventually become stable and thus <code>latest</code>. You get the point. Be careful with tag latest, as it will switch to the newer version in some time. I would suggest you to use specific tags instead of the <code>latest</code>. As you would do with any other dependencies and libraries.</p>
<p>But what about this <code>alpine</code> group of tags? At this moment your images may be ready, if not wait till they are, and execute</p>
<pre><code>$ docker images
</code></pre><p>You may see something like this, (your results may vary slightly):</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8</span>             ...          312<span>MB</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8-alpine</span>.     ...         70<span>.8MB</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="its-all-about-sizes">It's all about sizes</h2>
<p>Notice the difference in the size of those docker images. Docker is all about minimising resources you need to run something. It would be way heavier, for example, to run a complete virtual machine. Docker is not a virtual machine but that’s beyond the scope of this material. With Docker, you can have running <code>Postgres</code> server in <code>70 MB</code>. Consider Docker containers as an isolated process that runs on your machine.</p>
<p>If you open each of the Postgres <code>Dockerfiles</code> (find the links on the Docker Hub, I mean it, go and click it) you will see they are built on top of different Docker base images. I’m talking about <code>Dockerfiles</code> in <code>Postgres</code> image documentation. There will be something like <code>FROM debian:stretch-slim</code> and <code>FROM alpine:3.11</code>. You don’t have to understand anything about <code>Dockerfile</code> for now. Let’s just say that our <code>Postgres</code> images have to run on some architecture, and in this case, it’s Debian or Alpine. You may see different tag suffixes, such as <code>stretch</code>, <code>slim</code>, <code>jessie</code> and they refer to the base image they are built on. The size of an image, <strong>and also a set of available tools</strong> will depend on that, as well. In the end, they throw out all unnecessary things to achieve the small size. Consider that later when you get familiar with Docker. We’ll use <code>alpine</code> images for now. If you check <a target="_blank" href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine distribution</a> site you’ll notice this motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small. Simple. Secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Think about what you've read. It may be all confusing. That's ok. Feel free to read it again. Docker is a complex thing. Many will try to grasp as much as possible about Docker and it will just cause a mess in their head. Especially if you're new into this. That's why I provided only fraction here. But this fraction will be enough for your next steps.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>

          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>
      <h3 id="1-draft-the-openingclosing">
        
        
          1. Draft the opening/closing <a href="#1-draft-the-openingclosing">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,         
# I find it easier to strike a natural tone when thinking relatively
# informally. So, I draft documents, even if they'll end up being 
# formal, informally. 
             
             
Sincerely, 
- Boss's name, Title, Company
# Yes, I write the closing right after the opening.
</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">
        
        
          2. Provide 1 general introduction/context sentence <a href="#2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

# Establish the relationship. This helps readers contextualize 
# what comes next
I met {person I am recommending} {n months ago} because

      <h3 id="3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">
        
        
          3. Say a complementary thing about yourself <a href="#3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this 
# person if I could" is plenty strong social signaling. 
I wish I could hire them myself, but don't have the budget and work
lined up to utilize them to their full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
</code></pre></div></div>
      
    

<p>This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you’ve chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

# add a punchy positive story
When she started at {company}, one of the first things she did was 
make many updates to our onboarding documentation. 

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a 
while. 

Any time she ran into friction or trouble, she would hunt down the 
answer, and immediately update the documentation so the next 
person would have a smoother process.

Sure enough, the next hire spent half the time she …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct link to the demo: <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-fullscreen/">https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-fullscreen/</a></p>
<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>
<p>Direct link to the demo: <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-clipboard-apis/">https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-clipboard-apis/</a></p>
<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>8 months ago, but it feels like years ago, somebody shared a link to broot <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21998638">on Hacker News</a>. There was some very kind messages and broot gained a few users. But I had more in my TODO list.</p>
<p>A lot was done since.</p>
<p>At first sight, <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot">broot</a> didn't change much:
It looks the same and what could be done then can still be done the same way, 500 commits and 60 releases later.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-still-explore-the-same-way">You can still explore the same way</h2>
<p>Broot still shows you an overview of directories, even huge ones, and lets you navigate and understand the structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-overview.png" alt="old_broot-overview"></p>
<h2 id="you-can-search-and-open-the-same-way">You can search and open the same way</h2>
<p>You search with a few keystrokes, navigate, hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a directory to focus it, or <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to <code>cd</code> to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-search.png" alt="old_broot-search"></p>
<p>You hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a file to ask the system to open it, or a <kbd>space</kbd>, a <kbd>e</kbd> then <kbd>enter</kbd> to edit it in your favorite editor.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-manipulate-files-the-same-way">You can manipulate files the same way</h2>
<p>You do the standard manipulations like <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>chmod</code>, etc. with just a space or a colon followed by the name of the verb and some arguments if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-cp.png" alt="old_broot-cp"></p>
<p>(here, after having selected my <code>deploy.sh</code> file with <code>sh</code>, I copy it into <code>preview.sh</code>)</p>

<h2 id="exploration-got-buffed">Exploration got buffed</h2>
<p>New data are available, for example the last modified dates and sizes which are deeply computed on directories (in background) and can be used for sorting.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/new_broot-explore.png" alt="new_broot-explore"></p>
<p>And there's a preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-text.png" alt="preview-text"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-image.png" alt="preview-image"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-binary.png" alt="preview-binary"></p>
<h2 id="searching-and-opening-got-buffed-too">Searching and opening got buffed too</h2>
<p>You can search on paths (not just filenames); or on file contents by prefixing your pattern with <code>c/</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search.png" alt="content-search"></p>
<p>If you hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>→</kbd>, which opens the preview, you see the matches in the file:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search-with-preview.png" alt="content-search-with-preview"></p>
<p>And from here you can navigate to the selected match, and maybe open the file on that line in your editor. A typical search process is described <a href="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-c-search/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just like for filtering on file names, content search results are updated while you type. And the search syntax lets you <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot/input/#the-filtering-pattern">combine searches</a>, for example you may find files containing both "foo" and "bar", but not the txt files, with <code>c/foo&amp;c/bar&amp;!/txt$/</code>.</p>
<p>Regarding file opening, the most requested feature was the ability to be back in broot when quitting vi or another terminal editor. This is now available.</p>
<h2 id="operations-on-files-got-buffed-too">Operations on files got buffed too</h2>
<p>The most visible change is the ability to open several panels, for example for operations involving two locations, like a move or copy:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/cpp.png" alt="cpp"></p>
<p>Now I have to confess something: I expected probably too much from this feature. While it works and doesn't seem to have problems it turns out I don't use it much. It was probably less important for easier file operations than less visible features like tab completion. I don't know yet if I was blinded by my fond remembrance of Norton Commander (back in the days of Windows 3.1) or if there's something that should be improved. I'll probably have to think about this more and I'm curious of the opinion of experienced broot users.</p>
<p>Customization of verbs and their keyboard shortcuts was also improved, allowing richer actions, like opening sub terminals or launching non trivial external applications.</p>

<p>Most of the initial technical choices were probably right.</p>
<p>My enthusiam for Rust only grew during this time and I'm not sure I could have as easily done so many big refactorings with another language, especially as broot being a "side project" I didn't have it fully in head 100% of the time.
Having whole categories of bugs prevented by the language is a huge relief.</p>
<p>The biggest internal change was the replacement of <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/termion">Termion</a> with <a href="https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm">Crossterm</a>.</p>
<p>Termion is obvious, concise, simple to use. It's still a good solution for a small linux utility. But it's limited and binding; its design makes features like skinning an application very difficult. And, at the time of the switch at least, it wasn't maintained and major bugs weren't handled.
Crossterm on the other hand, while intrinsically more complex, was more powerful.
Its main maintainers tackled the hard work of building a real cross-platform terminal IO library, which involves dealing with an incredible number of small discrepancies.
This choice allowed me to distribute broot on Mac and Windows and not just Linux.</p>
<p>I also introduced more concurrency, to make computations parallel and not block the interface.</p>
<p>Rust makes concurrency harder. You have to go to some length to do that properly, you can't just share a pointer and hope everything will be fine. It also makes it safer.
"Fearless concurrency" means you won't spend hours trying to guess all the ways your parallel computation could get unlucky. I found <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam">Crossbeam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> very useful basic bricks for building parallelims in broot.</p>

<p>In the last 8 months, I probably didn't spend one hour on a computer without using broot, I'm convinced it's a very useful tool which has no equivalent.</p>
<p>Using broot all the time made my TODO list grow to more than 600 lines (down to about 400 lines now). But there's nothing major anymore on it, nothing I feel essential, broot feels complete for me.</p>
<p>Right now what I'd like for broot is to find users, and with some luck some of those users will tell me how they use it which would fuel my reflection.</p>

It's an embarrassing question for both parties, but especially frustrating for the forgetful one. With all the information we take in on a daily basis, these little lapses are irritating but inevitable, right? Maybe not.&nbsp;</p>  <p>While it's unlikely that you can remember every day crystal clearly (like those who have HSAM, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/total-recall-some-people-can-remember-every-day-like-it-was-yesterday" target="_blank"><u>Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory</u></a>), there are strategies for improving memory retention outside of <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/media/the-passionate-eye/season-1/episode-102/38e815a-00dc9c2fa63" target="_blank"><u>fighting memory loss</u></a> associated with aging. We asked <a href="http://www.artdelamemoire.org/in-english" target="_blank"><u>Francis Blondin</u></a>, two-time Canadian Memory Champion and board member of the <a href="http://canadianmindsports.com/" target="_blank"><u>Canadian Mind Sports Association</u></a>, for his insight on the different kinds of memory and where we might be able to focus our brain building efforts.</p>  <p><strong>Natural vs. trained memory</strong></p>  <p>Blondin highlights the distinction between "memory as a natural ability that we all possess to varying degrees, versus memorization, as a skill that you can learn to get better at." He says, "It's not the same thing, and you can become extremely good at memorizing stuff, even if you happen to be born with below average memory." Though you <em>can</em> improve your natural memory through lifestyle, Blondin says natural memory abilities are largely dependent on your genes. Your trained memory, however, "can be spectacularly improved almost without limits."&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I can spend hours reciting all the thousands of things I have stored in various memory palaces," he says. More on memory palaces later. "When I'm at my peak, I can memorize 100 digits in less than a minute. And yet, I swear that my natural memory is still, to this day, nothing special at all. Just yesterday I ruined my coffee maker by forgetting it on the stove long enough for the plastic handle to melt." So, even if you don't think your natural memory is all that great, there's still a lot you can do.</p>  <p><strong>Types of memory</strong></p>  <p>Blonding took us through the different kinds of memory and their functions.</p>  <p><strong>Implicit and explicit memory</strong></p>  <p><strong>"</strong>Explicit memory is what you can say out loud: 'Newton was an important scientist'" says Blondin. "Implicit is everything else." He offers these examples: "The feeling that you probably should avoid falling off a cliff or putting your hands on a hot stove is a form of implicit memory. So is every ability you've learned to perform, like riding a bike or tying your shoelaces."</p>  <p><strong>Procedural memory</strong></p>  <p>Procedural memory describes a specific kind of implicit memory that includes all the abilities you've developed. Blondin says these include "how to read and write, how to hold a fork and again, how to ride a bike." To better develop these abilities, Blondin points to K. Anders Ericsson's concept of <a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf" target="_blank"><u>deliberate practice</u></a> — focused, systematic practice to optimize performance.</p>  <p><strong>Sensory memory</strong></p>  <p>"That's all the thousands of bits of data that we're perceiving all the time through our senses," says Blondin. "Of this almost-infinite amount of data, 99+ per cent will be forgotten in half a second, but your brain will select a few things that, for various reasons, seem to be worthy of attention." This isn't typically the kind of memory you try to improve, but Blondin offers the example of "people who are passionate about cooking, over time, will develop a more powerful sensory memory for different tastes."</p>  <p><strong>Short-term and working memory</strong></p>  <p>Short-term and working memory are terms often used interchangeably, though the two have complex distinctions that are still being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425965/" target="_blank"><u>analyzed</u></a>. In simple terms, working memory can be seen as a pattern or a process, while short-term memory is more focused on duration. "Working memory is what you use in real time to consciously remember something, analyze something or perform an action," Blondin says. Working memory also involves your ability to group data into chunks. Blondin uses the example of learning how to speak French. "At the beginning, saying the word <em>bibliothèque</em> might necessitate most of your working memory capacity." You might need to break the word into multiple chunks: <em>bi - blio - thèque</em>. With time and practice, you'll be able to say a full sentence containing the word <em>bibliothèque</em>, while also thinking about what comes next. "Improving your working memory is like improving your IQ," he says, "it's pretty damn hard. I think it's possible, but it's not something most people should focus on."</p>  <p><strong>Episodic memory</strong></p>  <p>Episodic memory is everything involved in "remembering your life and what happened to you," Blondin says. "Although episodic memory is stored in your brain differently than factual knowledge, there isn't much difference between the tips and tricks I would give to someone hoping to better remember their life."</p>  <p><strong>Semantic memory</strong></p>  <p>Semantic memory covers areas like factual knowledge, words, numbers, concepts and so on. Blondin says, "This is most people's main area of focus when they say they worry about their memory. All the tips I've provided will help tremendously."</p>  <p><strong>Tips for improving your memory</strong></p>  <p><strong>Learn to focus on just one thing at a time (at least for a moment)</strong></p>  <p>"Your ability to concentrate is crucial for memorizing and for most important cognitively-demanding forms of work," Blondin says. "Your ability to focus can be trained and it can be improved. If you're a student and you want to learn and remember a lot, you need to get your cell phone and internet addiction under control. Those quick, 30-second checks of your email are much more damaging to your concentration than you can imagine." Blondin suggests giving yourself at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted focus before taking a short break. "Ideally those short breaks should be for walking around, breathing, chatting with someone or eating," he says, "not for your emails or anything that will keep capturing your attention when you try to go back to work."</p>  <p><strong>Don't just listen or read — test yourself</strong></p>  <p>"To remember something long-term, the two most important concepts you need to know are retrieval practice and spaced repetition," says Blondin. "Retrieval practice is basically just testing yourself. Don't just reread your notes, close your book and see how much you can recall without any aid. That's not just a way to verify what has been remembered, it's also an extremely powerful way to learn. You can read and reread a million books and spend a million years sitting in class, but very little of what you've read and heard will stick if you don't make an effort to actively process and recall the information." Even if your goals aren't academic, Blodin says, "You should still use retrieval practice by asking yourself questions like 'What's my credit card number?' or 'What's the name of that guy again?'".</p>  <p><strong>Spaced repetitions for long-term learning</strong></p>  <p>Spaced repetition is a systematic review system. Blondin says, "On the first day, you review [something] as much as you need to in order to make sure you won't forget it after a few hours. One or two reviews will be enough for that purpose most of the time. Then you review once the following day. Then you start spacing out the reviews." He suggests a three day interim, then seven days, then one month, two months, three months and so on. "Eventually, just two reviews a year can be enough," Blondin believes. "You can become really good at memorizing and at building memory palaces, but you'll still forget most of what you learn if you never review. That's not a problem if you just want to do something once, like a presentation or an exam, but for long-term learning, there's no getting around the fact that you need to review." Blondin also recommends using spaced repetition software (like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank"><u>Anki</u></a> or <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank"><u>Quizlet</u></a>) to help you along. Spaced repetition and retrieval practice can be combined to help you "remember amazing amounts of information," says Blondin.</p>  <p><strong>Mnemonics and memory palaces</strong></p>  <p>"There are many things you can learn using just focused attention, direct associations, logic, understanding and your natural memory," Blondin says. "However, there are also a lot of facts, difficult words, names, numbers and concepts that won't easily stick." For those, Blondin suggests using mnemonics, where your brain transforms something difficult to remember into something "your strange brain can remember much more easily."&nbsp;</p>  <p>With names he says, "It's easy enough if I just heard it and it's floating around in my short-term memory, but I'll forget it in a few seconds if I don't make an effort. How can I make this name more memorable?" He suggests adding associations and imagery. The name "Bob", for example, might conjure an image of bobbing for apples. Blondin says, "That quickly improvised image will transform what's initially a bunch of mostly meaningless sounds into something funny and easy to remember." He points to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/upshot/an-ancient-and-proven-way-to-improve-memory-go-ahead-and-try-it.html" target="_blank"><u>New York Times article</u></a> that breaks down the process in depth.</p>  <p>Similar in practice, the <a href="https://litemind.com/memory-palace/" target="_blank"><u>memory palace</u></a> technique consists of vividly visualizing an environment you know very well, like your bedroom, and associating information you need to memorize with it (eg. your credit card number is in the sock drawer). Then, when you walk through that environment again in your mind, that information will be in place for you to retrieve.</p>  <p>These tips don't have to be flawless to have the desired effect. "To paraphrase someone else," says Blondin, "memory techniques work even when they don't work. Just the fact that you're paying attention to something and you're playing around with it is enough to drastically improve your odds of remembering."</p>  <p><strong>Lifestyle practices</strong></p>  <p>"Both meditation and physical exercise will help improve your memory and your ability to focus," says Blondin, "but that's just one of at least 50 different reasons why you should start developing those two habits." Blondin suggests that even one minute per day of meditation can have an impact.</p>  <p>"Diet is, of course, very important for all kinds of reasons," notes Blondin, "but as long as you have a relatively healthy diet, I …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Somewhere in the depths of my hard drive is a folder named “Archive”. It’s a home for all sorts of files that I no longer need, but can’t quite bring myself to delete. Old homework assignments from high school, revisions 1 through FINISHED-FINAL.doc. MSN chat logs, preserving conversations with people I’ve not spoken to in 10 years. Random low-resolution photos of not very much, shot with the first digital camera my family ever owned. Layers of backup directories piled above the deposits of those before them, poised to restore devices long since sold on eBay. A veritable time capsule of my digital life.</p>
<p>Not something I pry open the lid on very often, but lockdown-induced nostalgia enticed me to visit again a few weeks ago. I was in search of the roots of my journey in programming. I found them inside a dormant virtual machine, the ghostly continuation of an old family computer that I had immortalised in .vmdk form.</p>
<p>Firing up VirtualBox, I went digging.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/MallardBASICBookCover.jpg">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/MallardBASICBookCover.jpg" width="220px" alt="Book cover: Mallard BASIC Introduction and Reference" title="Book cover: Mallard BASIC Introduction and Reference">
</a>
</p>
<h2 id="ccd-qbasicbc7">C:&gt;cd QBASIC\BC7</h2>
<p>It all started about 16 years ago. I was already a proficient user of technology in general, as most computer game-obsessed teenagers are wont to be. My initial motivation for skilling up was quite simple, albeit ambitious: I wanted to be able to “hack” a certain online game. Luckily, I wasn’t expecting quick results and soon lost sight of this nefarious goal to discover the joy of programming as something in itself.</p>
<p>My Grandad had on several occasions previously attempted to enthuse me in the subject, to no avail. Now, excited that I was finally displaying interest of my own accord, he provided me with a floppy disk containing QBasic 1.1 and a manual for Mallard BASIC. I started at page 1 and worked my way through the book — as far as the difference in dialect between QBasic and Mallard BASIC would allow, anyway.</p>
<h3 id="first-step-into-a-larger-world">First step into a larger world</h3>
<p>Safe to say, it took me a while to get enough of a hang of things before I could really begin to translate ideas from my imagination onto screen. The first game I created was Asterix[sic] 9. It was probably also my first “substantial” program, built with other users in mind, not just for myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/asterix9.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/asterix9.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing playthrough of Asterix 9, a simple maze puzzle game" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>Asterix 9 went through many rewrites as I discovered more and more programming concepts. The debut version is written almost as if parodying the worst kind of BASIC program: I had not yet realised that QBasic did not require every line to be numbered (as the Mallard BASIC book would have me believe!), and concepts like arrays, looping, functions, and DRY were still very much unknown to me. The liberal use of GOTOs makes it very spaghetti-esque, not helped by non-existence of human readable labels. Every level of the game is just a copy-and-paste of the previous level with line numbers incremented (this used to take me hours of “refactoring”). It’s truly awful. I’d be lying, however, if I said I didn’t have an absolute blast figuring out how to code it, at the time.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of part of the game loop that checks teleportation and collision into one of the “9"s:</p>
<pre><code>4161 IF currx% = 4 AND curry% = 8 AND count1 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 4550
4162 IF currx% = 14 AND curry% = 18 AND count2 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 4680
4163 IF currx% = 20 AND curry% = 14 AND count3 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 5100
4164 IF currx% = 12 AND curry% = 12 AND count4 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 5230
4165 COLOR 5
4166 IF count1 &lt; 1 THEN LOCATE 4, 8: PRINT CHR$(176)
4167 IF count2 &lt; 1 THEN LOCATE 14, 18: PRINT CHR$(176)
4168 IF count3 &lt; 1 THEN LOCATE 20, 14: PRINT CHR$(176)
4169 IF count4 &lt; 1 THEN LOCATE 12, 12: PRINT CHR$(176)
4170 count = count + 1
4180 IF currx% = 4 AND curry% = 6 THEN GOTO 9300
4190 IF currx% = 4 AND curry% = 12 THEN GOTO 9300
4200 IF currx% = 6 AND curry% = 6 THEN GOTO 9300
4210 IF currx% = 6 AND curry% = 8 THEN GOTO 9300
...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="evolution-via-emulation">Evolution via emulation</h3>
<p>I’ve always had an urge to learn how things work from the ground up, and this endeavour was no different. A lot of my effort was spent exploring how programs that I was familiar with might have been implemented.</p>
<p>As I got the hang of ASCII text manipulation and interacting with devices other than the screen, I created a simple word processor. I had not yet discovered mouse controls, so it was entirely keyboard-driven, including the menu options. It was able to save and load a custom rich text format that included support for different colours (the 16 supported in <code>SCREEN 0</code> mode).</p>
<p>Implementing word wrap in this setting was among my proudest achievements up to this point!</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/wp.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/wp.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing writing a document in 'word processor'" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>I also wrote an “encoder” version that “encrypted” its document, and could load and decrypt documents stored on disk. The only problem was that it used an approximately 6-bit key, which in any event was stored inside the encrypted file — thankfully I know a bit more about security today!</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/encoder.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/encoder.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing encrypting and decrypting a message in 'encoder'" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>These programs were at least several steps up in quality from that first version of Asterix 9. I’d learned that labels weren’t mandatory for every line, and they could be human-readable. I’d also learned a few more control flow patterns and how to use <code>DATA</code> to encode blocks of data outside of the code. Young me still very much could have benefitted from reading Clean Code, however!</p>
<pre><code>TYPE encryption
        enco AS INTEGER
        encryptnu AS INTEGER
        length AS INTEGER
END TYPE
DIM code AS encryption
...
RANDOMIZE TIMER
encrypt = INT(RND * 45) + 3
...
OPEN filename$ FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = LEN(code)
code.encryptnu = encrypt
code.length = l
PUT 1, 1, code
</code></pre>
<p>My fascination with wanting to build things from scratch eventually reached its logical conclusion: I wanted to create my own operating system<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My first attempt at this was named “CharnOS”, based on my internet alias at the time<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Really it was just a window manager, but I didn’t yet know the difference. All the “apps” were full screen and the cursor was operated using arrow keys — I <em>still</em> hadn’t worked out mouse support.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/charnos.bas.gif">

</a>
</p>

<p>It was around this time that I found <a href="http://www.petesqbsite.com/">Pete’s QBasic Site</a> and the information, forums, and community within. This was a goldmine! I met a few people there and got to know them via MSN. Some of them effectively became my mentors. My rate of learning skyrocketed, and I got my hands on QBasic 7 which included library support for mouse input and the ability to compile to EXE, among other exciting features.</p>
<p>My operating system aspirations continued, now with mouse support. Version 2, renamed to “Nebula”, was the most complete. It featured moveable windows, various types of UI widget, and multi-user support. The visual style was borrowed from an aforementioned mentor’s own creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula1.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula1.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing logging in to Nebula window manager, and running the jotter text editor app. It's reminiscent of Windows 9x and also very slow." title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>Following this, I began to discover more modern programming languages like C, C++, PHP, and C#. I began to recognise that I’d really hit the limits of QBasic and that my journey would have to continue on more modern platforms. The Win32 API would prove to heavily inspire version 3 of Nebula, which had a slightly more mature look. It got about this far before I abandoned it, and set my sights on other things.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula2.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula2.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing Nebula window manager version 3, even more reminiscent of Windows 9x" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>That said, I would still occasionally dip into QBasic—even years later—for fun graphical demos, like this fire simulation:</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/fire.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/fire.bas.gif" width="480px" alt="Screen capture showing an animation of fire that starts at the bottom of the screen and slowly spreads upwards" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>When I could make do with VGA graphics, QBasic was still the lowest code-to-pixel barrier of any of the programming languages I knew. And perhaps it still is. In how many other languages is it possible to set up a blank canvas and draw a pixel in literally only two lines of code?</p>
<pre><code>SCREEN 13
PSET (20,20), 100
</code></pre>
<h2 id="qbasic-as-a-learning-experience">QBasic as a learning experience</h2>
<p>If there’s a point to this post beyond self-indulgence, it might be to reflect on how QBasic fared as a learning experience for someone new to programming. I’m not saying we should consider encouraging beginners to take their first steps in <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>—from which the world had arguably moved on, even at the point when I started—but maybe there are some aspects of the experience that we can learn from.</p>
<p>QBasic was a safe and accessible sandbox for beginner me to explore my creativity within. I’m sure there are modern alternatives that offer similar experiences, I just haven’t been on the lookout for them. It’s impossible for me to exactly re-envisage the perspective that started me on this journey 16 years ago. Sure, I still find coding and solving problems to be fun, but never in <em>quite</em> the same way as I did back then, when everything was new and exciting.</p>
<p>Convenience is a double-edged sword. The QBasic IDE hides a lot of complexity from the programmer. I didn’t need to worry about compiling, or linking, or the command-line in general. Double-clicking QBX.EXE would drop me instantly into the action, ready for me to just start writing and running code. The language itself is also purposefully, well, basic. There’s relatively little “structural syntax”, for lack of a better term, and the IDE even attempts to hide some of that. I think this was beneficial to begin with, but increased the learning curve when I eventually moved on to languages with a <em>lot</em> of structural syntax like C and C#. I still remember being utterly baffled by the arcane incantations of a C “hello, world”: what on Earth does any of <code> void main(int argc, char *argv[])</code> mean?!</p>
<p>These would have been learning curves no matter what, but I feel that delaying them until later meant I was able to make quicker progress. I would have been much less inclined to bash my head against walls like linker errors if I wasn’t already hooked. And of course, even if today’s mainstream languages might have a higher barrier to entry than in the past, this is offset by the convenience of finding help. Tutorials, documentation, books, Stack Overflow: there is so much more support available to beginners now.</p>
<p>What motivated me is certainly not going to apply to everyone. In hindsight, luckily, QBasic worked as my first programming language because it turned out I was motivated by the art of programming in itself, and at the beginning I just wanted to have fun. Had I instead wanted to create a website to share with people, or a mobile game to sell on the App Store, it would …</p></div></div>

<p>The Rust programming language has become a popular choice amongst software engineers since its release in 2010. Besides being something new and interesting, Rust promised to offer exceptional performance and reliability. In particular, Rust achieves memory-safety and thread-safety through its ownership model. Instead of runtime checks, this safety is assured at compile time by Rust's borrow checker. This prevents undefined behaviour such as dangling pointers!</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>I first encountered Rust sometime around 2015 when I was updating my teaching materials on memory management in C. A year later in 2016, I implemented a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in Rust as an academic exercise (available: <a href="https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea">https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea</a>). I didn't have any formal training with Rust, nor did I complete any tutorial series, I just figured things out using the documentation as I progressed through my project.</p>
<p>Some example code from this project takes ZDT1 from its mathematical expression in Equation 1</p><p>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1(x_1) &amp;= x_1 \tag{1} \\
f_2(x) &amp;= g \cdot h \\
g(x_2,\ldots,x_{\mathrm{D}}) &amp;= 1 + 9 \cdot \sum_{d=2}^{\mathrm{D}} \frac{x_d}{(D-1)}\\
h(f_1,g) &amp;= 1 - \sqrt{f1/g}
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p>to the Rust implementation below.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>It was interesting to see that since writing this code in 2016, some of my dependencies have been deprecated and replaced.</p>
<p>My greatest challenge was breaking away from what I already knew. Until this point, I was familiar with languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, MATLAB, etc., with the majority of my time spent working with memory managed languages. I found myself resisting Rust's intended usage, and it is still something I'm working on.</p>
<p>Now that I am about to commence my sabbatical from my University post, I've decided to try Rust again. This time, I'm going to write a book which focusses on using Rust and Jupyter Notebooks to implemented algorithms and conducted experiments, most likely in the fields of search, optimisation, and machine learning. Can we write and execute all our code in a Jupyter Notebook? Yes! <em>Should</em> we? Probably not. However, I enjoy the workflow, and making this an enjoyable process is important to me.</p>

        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your

        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of
        others which might be inapplicable or even wrong.</p>

            <p>
	"Want to hear the joke about insulin?" goes the bleak gag about America's drug prices. "You have to go to Canada to get it."</p>
<p>
	But even that's not an option anymore.</p>
<p>
	Pandemic travel restrictions have made Americans prisoners of their country. Even within North America, Mexico and Canada have closed thousands of kilometres of border to all but essential travel, roiling plans for vacation, work, and school. For cash-strapped Americans, it has also cut off access to medicines and health-care services that they can't afford at home -- at a time when money is tighter than ever.</p>
<p>
	Stephanie Boland's nine-year-old son was diagnosed with diabetes in December. Travelling to Canada to fill his insulin prescription took a half-day's drive from where they live in Brainerd, Minnesota, but it was worth it -- the purchase was a simple, over-the-counter affair. One pack of injection pens, which would last several months, cost less than a hundred dollars, she says, compared to <a href="https://www.lillypricinginfo.com/humalog" target="_blank">a list price of $530 at home. </a></p>
<p>
	As their son's disease began to rewrite the routines of daily life, the Bolands planned to cross into Canada again to restock. Then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>
	Boland, a masseuse, was forced to stop working. Her husband, a self-employed financial adviser, found his income hit by pandemic-related turbulence in the markets, too. Then their source for affordable insulin vanished behind <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/19/opinions/canada-us-border-coronavirus-bociurkiw/index.html" target="_blank">a border that had never been closed before</a> in the history of <a href="https://theconversation.com/shuttered-canada-us-border-highlights-different-approaches-to-the-pandemic-and-differences-between-the-2-countries-137848" target="_blank">U.S.-Canada relations</a>.</p>
<p>
	"We were going to make a trip north, one more trip in March, but then they closed the border," she said.</p>
<h3>
	BUYING INSULIN ABROAD</h3>
<p>
	Only 1.5% of American adults who take prescription medications buy their drugs abroad, according to a June analysis by researchers at the University of Florida Gainesville, based on a 2015-2017 National Health Interview Survey.</p>
<p>
	But that's still <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2767592?resultClick=3" target="_blank">an estimated 2.3 million people</a>.</p>
<p>
	Many medicines and medical services are cheaper in neighbouring Canada and Mexico, thanks to price controls and <a href="https://www.oecd.org/mexico/38097348.pdf" target="_blank">the power of the U.S. dollar</a>. The difference is great enough that U.S. insurer PEHP, which covers Utah's state employees, offers partially paid trips to Vancouver and Tijuana "<a href="https://www.pehp.org/pharmacy/tourism" target="_blank">to help you save money on your prescriptions</a>."</p>
<p>
	In popular Mexican resort towns like Cabo San Lucas on the West Coast, or Tulum on the East Coast, pharmacies, doctors and dentists targeting U.S. clientele dot the main drag, their prices on bright display. And the difference between those prices and the costs of the same drugs at U.S. pharmacies can mean life or death.</p>
<p>
	No drug is a better-known example of that calculus than insulin, a vital hormone in the body's metabolism. Seven million American diabetics don't produce it naturally -- or not enough of it -- and need to inject it throughout the day. Without it, dangerous levels of glucose build up in the blood, damaging organs and producing a painful stupor. In a worst case scenario, lack of insulin can kill within three days.</p>
<p>
	Americans have been going to Canada for insulin since scientists learned how to produce it in labs at the University of Toronto in 1921. One of the first patients to try it was an American: Elizabeth Hughes, the teenage daughter of then-U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.</p>
<p>
	"I'm so happy and elated," <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AL10111" target="_blank">she wrote</a> in a letter to her mother from Canada, describing her first self-injection and the "enormous" meal she enjoyed afterward. Before crossing the border, the 15-year-old had managed her condition by starving herself -- the only life-prolonging trick available to diabetics before insulin. Five feet tall, she weighed only <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10006" target="_blank">45 pounds.</a></p>
<p>
	A hundred years later, and after <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/08/us/states-passing-bills-insulin-insurance-copay-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">national soul-searching</a> over the soaring cost of insulin, some Americans are still starving themselves. Daniel Carlisle, a Type 1 diabetic in Texas, has sometimes tried not to eat for days at a time, in an attempt to ration insulin. When he was 18 and short on cash, he even contemplated robbing a pharmacy, he says.</p>
<p>
	"I always do the math about how many days' supply of insulin I have in the refrigerator," the 60-year-old Texan says.</p>
<p>
	"That's how I know my lifespan at that point. My lifespan is measured in exactly how many days' worth of insulin I have in hand -- plus three days."</p>
<h3>
	NUEVO PROGRESO</h3>
<p>
	For the past three years, buying insulin in Mexico has brought Carlisle security.</p>
<p>
	His trips started with a split tooth in 2017. "I went to a dentist near where I live, and he said he could repair it for like $10,000," says Carlisle, who is uninsured. "So I told him, 'Look I can't afford to send my kids to Harvard. Sure can't afford to send yours."</p>
<p>
	He tried to ignore his aching tooth, but at the urging of his family, eventually drove several hundred kilometres south from his home in Houston to the busy Mexican town of Nuevo Progreso.</p>
<p>
	"As soon as you come across the bridges, hawkers are saying "Need a dentist? Need a pharmacy? It's just constant," he says. First he got his tooth fixed -- a root canal, bridge and crown altogether would end up costing him just $750. "The dentists aren't marble palaces, but they're clean," he says.</p>
<p>
	Then he dipped into a pharmacy to ask the price of a vial of Humalog insulin, one of two kinds he takes. The answer: US$70. He checked the expiration date on the box, and then offered $20.</p>
<p>
	"You've got to negotiate!" he says. "I just tell them I'll die without it and then they'll lose a customer. They don't put up a fuss."</p>
<p>
	A vial of the same insulin in the U.S. has a list price of $274.70.</p>
<p>
	Since then, that's the only place where he buys insulin, Carlisle says, and he's never had a problem with its quality. But with the borders closed, he doesn't expect be back any time soon.</p>
<h3>
	A VAST GREY AREA</h3>
<p>
	Pharmacy staff in several drugstores in border towns in both Canada and Mexico tell CNN that they've seen significant drops in foot traffic since their countries' borders with the U.S. closed. Though American scofflaws have been accused of crossing into Mexico for nonessential errands, overall border crossings <a href="https://explore.dot.gov/views/BorderCrossingData/Monthly?:embed=y&amp;:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:showVizHome=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">have plummeted</a>.</p>
<p>
	One young man working at a pharmacy near Tijuana told CNN that business had fallen about 40% since the border closed. He asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak about the business.</p>
<p>
	Technically, bringing prescription drugs into the U.S. is illegal. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.fda.gov_industry_import-2Dbasics_personal-2Dimportation&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=tq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ&amp;r=rCHQaNbjPpivEAmu6NC2SN5wUrEBtRzWRu-4Q4NII98&amp;m=WQfC6uO0pwOxMMVHYr1M2sV1Imudp8inpPiV52_rqCQ&amp;s=rhQ5OrNJsHfUWt-LO0TyUzEZRLTw60VpuTji1hJpH7k&amp;e=" target="_blank">a grey area</a> for small amounts: Importation "might" be allowed, according to the agency's website, if the medicine doesn't exceed a three month supply.</p>
<p>
	Staff at Mark's Marine Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada, less than an hour's drive from the U.S. border, typically fill hundreds of orders for U.S. customers each day, general manager Jordan Rosenblatt says, and rarely have any problem shipping it. With the borders closed, online ordering has spiked, he adds.</p>
<p>
	Reviews over the years on their Facebook page compare prices of all kinds of prescription drugs to those in the U.S., with commenters from as far as New Jersey and Texas. "They sell and send me my asthma inhalers at a price that is non-predatory, unlike here in the U.S. Happiest gal today! Thank you!" reads one.</p>
<p>
	But ordering online isn't for everyone -- there is always a risk that the medicine will be confiscated or that temperature-sensitive drugs like insulin could go bad waiting at customs or in U.S. Postal Service delays.</p>
<p>
	And as the frustrations of border closures highlight, foreign health systems make a poor fallback no matter how you access them.</p>
<p>
	"For any given individual in the short run, going to Canada is a decent solution, but it's not a systemic solution," says Dr. Vikas Saini, a Harvard-trained cardiologist and president of the<a href="https://lowninstitute.org/" target="_blank"> Lown Institute</a>, a nonpartisan health-care think tank.</p>
<p>
	U.S. President Donald Trump has called to allow larger scale importation from Canada, among <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-drug-prices-fact-check/index.html" target="_blank">a raft of recent proposals</a> to reduce the prices of certain U.S. drugs. But that's unlikely to make a dent in the U.S. market, Saini says: "Canada is a country of about 30 million people. It doesn't have enough medication to provide all those prescriptions for the U.S. -- a nation 10 times the size."</p>
<p>
	Some <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/drug-exports-us-1.5236532" target="_blank">Canadian health industry groups</a> and patients agree. Since 2019, they've warned that Trump's importation plan could lead to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/american-demand-canada-drug-supply-1.5226871" target="_blank">drug shortages</a> for Canadians -- a fear likely sharpened after witnessing global shortages of vital medical equipment in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3>
	A CRUMBLING ECONOMY</h3>
<p>
	As the pandemic wears on, the options are dwindling for Americans who can't afford to be sick in the United States -- especially after the cratering economy erased<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/07/economy/july-2020-jobs-report/index.html" target="_blank"> nearly 13 million</a> jobs, taking health insurance options with them.</p>
<p>
	Even <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-canada-drug-prices-1.5552463" target="_blank">at Canadian prices</a>, some are struggling to pay for their prescriptions. "Recently, we're hearing about all the financial issues of people laid off," says Rosenblatt, the Vancouver pharmacy manager. "We have American customers that have been working with us for years, and under these circumstances, we've sent what they needed and we tell them, 'Pay us when you can.'"</p>
<p>
	To make insulin more accessible, some U.S. states have pushed for price caps on copays. The three companies which <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process" target="_blank">control the U.S. insulin market</a> offer discount plans, including <a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-releases.html?122988" target="_blank">new programs</a> to which Americans who were financially impacted by the pandemic can apply for temporary access to cheaper or free insulin. And Walmart offers cheap insulin over the counter (though this is an older formulation that can make blood sugar management more complicated than newer, prescription versions.)</p>
<p>
	Yet many are still struggling -- and not just the <a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/" target="_blank">nearly 28 million Americans</a> who don't have health insurance, a number estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even Americans with health insurance, who benefit from negotiated prices that are lower than the list prices, sometimes <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/29/go-there-insulin-high-cost.cnn" target="_blank">still can't afford</a> all the costs of living with diabetes.</p>

<p>In this post, we discuss the risks of the AWS Instance Metadata service in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. In particular, we demonstrate that compromising a pod in the cluster can have disastrous consequences on resources in the AWS account if access to the Instance Metadata service is not explicitly blocked.</p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>



<p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll use an EKS cluster running Kubernetes v1.17.9 and created with <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a>. We could also have created the cluster using Terraform or CloudFormation.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">eksctl create cluster \ 
  --nodes 1 \ 
  --name christophe-cluster \ 
  --node-type t3.large</pre>



<p>Once we created the cluster, we can use the AWS CLI to update our kubectl configuration file for us and start interacting with the Kubernetes API right away.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name christophe-cluster
Added new context arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:account-id:cluster/christophe-cluster to /home/christophetd/.kube/config</pre>



<h2><span id="It_all_starts_with_a_compromised_Pod8230">It all starts with a compromised Pod…</span></h2>



<p>Let’s assume an attacker compromised a pod in the cluster, for instance by exploiting a vulnerability in the web application it was running. We simulate this scenario by running a pod and attaching to a shell inside it.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl run --rm -i --tty mypod --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sh

(pod)$ hostname
mypod</pre>



<p>Good! As an attacker, we’re now interested to enumerate resources in the cluster and in the associated AWS account. For completeness, we can have a look at the ATT&amp;CK-like threat matrix for Kubernetes by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/02/attack-matrix-kubernetes/">Microsoft</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/k8s-matrix.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll take a look at how the AWS Instance Metadata API (circled in green) <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/abusing-aws-metadata-service-using-ssrf-vulnerabilities/">strikes again</a> and allows us to do interesting things.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated.png 927w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated-300x161.png 300w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px"></figure>



<h2><span id="A_refresher_on_the_AWS_Instance_Metadata_service">A refresher on the AWS Instance Metadata service</span></h2>



<p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata service</a> is an AWS API listening on a link-local IP address, 169.254.169.254. It is only accessible from EC2 instances and allows to retrieve various information about them. </p>



<p>It is particularly useful when you need your instances to access AWS resources. Instead of hard-coding credentials, you first assign an IAM role to your instance. From the instance, you can then retrieve temporary credentials for the role. This is 100 % transparent if you use the AWS CLI.</p>



<h2><span id="Accessing_the_Instance_Metadata_service_from_a_compromised_pod">Accessing the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod</span></h2>



<p>At first sight, it’s unclear what would happen if we were to query the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod – so let’s give it a try.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/                                                                                                                                             
ami-id                                                                                                                                                                                        
ami-launch-index
...
security-groups</pre>



<p>Good. What’s the context of the data returned?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info

  "InstanceProfileId" : "AIPA..."
}</pre>



<p>Interestingly enough, we see that we can access the Instance Metadata service and that we’re able to retrieve temporary credentials for the IAM role <em>christophe-cluster-nodegroup-ng-15050c0b-<strong>NodeInstanceProfile</strong>-1AS40JWHFGXJ2</em>. </p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H

}
</pre>



<p>This is the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instances acting as Kubernetes worker nodes! What can we do with it?</p>



<h2><span id="Least_privilege_you_say">Least privilege, you say?</span></h2>



<p>This role is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html">documented</a> by AWS, and we can see it’s attached to the following AWS managed policies:</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 749w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></figure>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdabbad00/status/998978082466758661?lang=en">Scott Piper</a> regularly rant about AWS managed policies, arguing they are too privileged. Are they?</p>

<p>Outch. Does that look bad? It’s because it is. Let’s see what these permissions allow us to do.</p>



<p>We can install the AWS CLI locally and set the credentials we retrieved earlier from the Instance Metadata service.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Xm/..
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=IQo...
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "A...Q:i-02f...",
    "Account": "account-id",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::account-id:assumed-role/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H/i-02..."
}</pre>



<p>Then, here are some examples of bad things we can do.</p>



<ul><li>Map the network, by <strong>listing and describing VPCs, subnets, and security groups</strong>. Not only the VPC associated to the EKS cluster, but <em>across the whole AWS account.</em><br></li><li><strong>Describe <em>any EC2 instance</em></strong><em> in the AWS account.</em> This includes information such as the AMI used, private IP, disks attached…<br></li><li><strong>Nuke <em>all network interfaces</em></strong><em> of every EC2 instan</em>ce with successive calls to <em>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</em>, <em>ec2:DetachNetworkInterface</em>, and <em>ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface</em>. This will bring offline all your instances and dependent AWS managed services. Your fancy EKS cluster? Gone. Your highly-available, auto-scalable web application spanning in 3 AZs? Offline. Great attack vector for a denial of service.<br></li><li><strong>Enumerate and pull any Docker image</strong> (“<em>ECR repository</em>“) in the account. As a bonus, you can even query the image vulnerability scan results by calling <em>ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings</em>. This will give you a nice list of the vulnerabilities <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html">identified</a> by AWS in these images. This can be very helpful for further exploitation of pods inside the EKS cluster. Who needs Nessus anyway?</li></ul>



<p>Again, all this is <strong>AWS account-wide</strong>, comes by default when spinning up an EKS cluster, and is accessible by only having compromised a single, underprivileged pod in the cluster.</p>



<h2><span id="Remediation">Remediation</span></h2>



<p>This flaw is actually not new – it’s even <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/restrict-ec2-credential-access.html">documented</a> by AWS, who suggests to block the Instance Metadata service by creating an iptables rule on every EKS worker node. This is rather impractical if your EKS nodes are managed by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">node groups</a>, dynamically spinning up EC2 instances to act as EKS worker nodes. You’d need to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-launch-template-and-custom-ami-support-in-amazon-eks-managed-node-groups/">custom node group launch template</a> or custom AMI.</p>



<p>Another option is to <strong>use Kubernetes network policies to block access to the Instance Metadata service</strong>. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s">Kubernetes network plugin</a> that EKS uses does not natively support network policies. The recommended workaround is to add the Calico Network Policy provider, which will be able to pick up your network policy objects and apply them. Note that this is <span>not</span> a full new <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/">CNI plugin</a> for your cluster, just a “network policy enforcer” (<a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/calico-network-policy-comes-to-kubernetes/">Calico supports both modes.</a>)</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html">AWS documentation</a>, we can install the Calico Network Policy provider on our cluster:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/release-1.6/config/v1.6/calico.yaml
# Wait for a few seconds...
$ kubectl get daemonset calico-node --namespace kube-system
NAME          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR                 AGE
calico-node   1         1         1       1            1           beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux   17m</pre>



<p>Calico runs as a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/">DaemonSet</a>, making sure that each worker node has its own Calico pod, picking up network policy objects and applying them locally on the nodes with iptables.</p>



<p>We can now write our network policy filtering egress traffic. In its simplest form, we will allow any outbound traffic not directed to the Instance Metadata IP.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3

<p>Hey I’m Ahmed, a self taught software engineer. In my path of self learning, I tried multiple languages and frameworks; and one of them was Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>That was at least 5 years ago, and I hated it. I didn’t know why, but it just felt different in a bad way at that time.</p>



<p>A few years after, exactly 3 months ago, I started learning Ruby on Rails again. But this time I was shocked! Why didn’t I learn it before? Look at how things are easier here? Why are we spending so much time in other frameworks while this is working out of the box?…</p>



<h2>The hobby phase</h2>



<p>As a developer, you start your coding journey as a hobby. You discovered code and how you can turn your ideas to life. Now, you’re hooked. You spend a lot of time coding and working with technology! In fact, according to this <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-coding-as-a-hobby">StackOverflow survey</a>, 80% of developers code as a hobby.</p>



<p>Before the technology boom, people used to hate their day job. It was a source of income so they can do other things on the side. But for code, it’s different. It’s a hobby <strong>and</strong> a daily job.</p>



<p>It’s a no brainer that, we as developers, tend to over-architect things, build things from scratch, re-invent the wheel, etc… It’s a hobby and we want to experience the most out of it. And as a fresh software engineer discovering this new hobby, you want languages and frameworks giving you more flexibility to create, architect, and play with technology.</p>



<p>You can spend hours trying to make two frameworks play nicely together. Create the perfect build process. Architect your todo app. Deploy your simple app to a multi-region cloud provider, etc. And in the end, you feel happy. You don’t feel like you wasted time, because it’s your hobby! And we don’t waste time on hobbies. They are a source of happiness.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>hobby phase</strong>. </p>



<hr>



<h2>The get-things-done phase</h2>



<p>As you get more experience in the field, you’re more likely move out of the hobby phase. This is due to different causes, and some of them are: </p>



<ul><li>You don’t have enough time outside work to play with code (family, children, other new hobbies…)</li><li>Your past experiences show it’s not worth it to spend so much time early on trying to optimize</li><li>You’re now happier to see a product launch more than the technology behind it</li><li>You have a broad knowledge about the product inside your organization</li><li>And others…</li></ul>



<p>As you reach this new phase, you do not care about frameworks and languages anymore. You want what gets the job done as your objectives are greater than the technology. You want a set of frameworks that plays nicely together and get the job done as quickly as possible. And that’s when you’ll find something like Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>Ruby on Rails is a set of tools and frameworks that plays nicely together as long as you use what’s given to you. You don’t have the freedom to use new frameworks or build things the way you want. But if you abide by the Ruby on Rails rules, you’ll move faster.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>get-things-done phase</strong>. Being on the get-things-done phase <strong>is a prerequisite</strong> to liking Ruby on Rails. No one likes something that limits their “creativity” if they are still in the hobby phase. </p>



<p>According to the same <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#experience">StackOverflow survey</a>, 67% of developers have less than 9 years of experience (40% have less than 5 years). That means, 67% are likely to be in the hobby phase. And this is one of the reasons why a lot of developers hate Ruby on Rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Skipping the hobby phase</h2>



<p>Being on the hobby phase isn’t bad. In your journey as a developer, you’ll start in the hobby phase. And with time, you’ll move slowly out of it. The timing it takes depends on each individual however.</p>



<p>But can you avoid it altogether? Yes, there are some exceptions. These are people coming from other disciplines. They are marketers, sales, and other non-technical people who discovered they can do more with code. <strong>Their primary objective isn’t to code. It’s to get help from code</strong>.</p>



<p>They are less likely to pick up new technologies or frameworks. They just want something that works and helps them in their job. They are more likely to pick something like Ruby on Rails. Or better, <strong>no-code tools</strong>.</p>

		Howdy 👋,

I’m Ahmed from Morocco and I build things using code, a.k.a a Software Engineer.

I hold an electrical engineering degree and I’m a self taught software developer. I figured out my love for building things when I started my first online business at the age of 17.

I blog at elazzabi.com and remote.ma.<br>

                    <p><strong><strong>The Defective Chessboard problem, </strong></strong>also known as the <strong><strong>Tiling Problem</strong></strong> is an interesting problem. It is typically solved with a “divide and conquer” approach. The algorithm has a time complexity of <strong><strong><em><em>O(n²)</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Given a <em><em>n </em></em>by <em><em>n</em></em> board where <em><em>n</em></em> is of form 2^k where k &gt;= 1 (Basically, n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing square). Fill the board using trionimos. A trionimo is an L-shaped tile is a 2 × 2 block with one cell of size 1×1 missing.</p><p>Solving the problem efficiently isn’t the goal of this post. Visualizing the board as the algorithm runs is much more interesting in my opinion, though. Lets discuss the algorithm first.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/660/0*adonlEHar0FeZ3XM.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The board with no defects added</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, a divide-and-conquer (DAC) technique is used to solve the problem. DAC entails splitting a larger problem into sub-problems, ensuring that each sub-problem is an exact copy of the larger one, albeit smaller. You may see where we are going with this, but lets do it explicitly.</p><p>The question we must ask before writing the algorithm is: is this even possible? Well, yes. The total number of squares on our board is <em><em>n</em></em>², or 4^<em><em>k</em></em>. Removing the defect, we would have 4^<em><em>k</em></em> — 1, which is always a multiple of three. This can be proved with mathematical induction pretty easily, so I won’t be discussing it.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/659/0*zOyl7BWBT9R4Csjd.png" alt="Image for post"></figure><h2 id="the-base-case">The base case</h2><p>Every recursive algorithm must have a base case, to ensure that it terminates. For us, lets consider the case when <em><em>n</em></em>, 2^<em><em>k</em></em> is 2. We thus have a 2×2 block with a single defect. Solving this is trivial: the remaining 3 squares naturally form a trionimo.</p><h2 id="the-recursive-step">The recursive step</h2><p>To make every sub-problem a smaller version of our original problem, all we have to do is add our own defects, but in a very specific way. If you take a closer look, adding a “defect” trionimo at the center, with one square in each of the four quadrants of our board, except for the one with our original defect would allow use to make four proper sub-problems, at the same time ensuring that we can solve the complete problem by adding a last trionimo to cover up the three pseudo-defective squares we added.</p><p>Once we are done adding the “defects”, recursively solving each of the four sub-problems takes us to our last step, which was already discussed in the previous paragraph.</p><h2 id="the-combine-step">The combine step</h2><p>After solving each of the four sub-problems and putting them together to form a complete board, we have 4 defects in our board: the original one will lie in one of the quadrants, while the other three were those we had intentionally added to solved the problem using <strong><strong>DAC</strong></strong>. All we have to do is add a final trionimo to cover up those three ‘defects’ and we are done.</p><p>Thus, the recursive equation for time complexity becomes:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = 4T(n/2)+c</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>The <strong><strong>4 </strong></strong>comes from the fact that to solve each problem of input n, we divide it into 4 sub-problems of input size <em><em>n/2 </em></em>(half the length of the original board). Once we are done solving those sub-problems, all that’s left to be done is to combine them: this is done by adding the last trionimo to cover up the pseudo-defects we added. This, of course, is done in constant time.</p><p>If you are interested in finding the asymptotic time complexity of the recurrence relation, you could try the <strong><strong>recursion tree method </strong></strong>or the <strong><strong>substitution method</strong></strong>. For now, lets just use the <strong><strong>Master theorem</strong></strong>.</p><p>The master theorem says that for a recurrence relation of the form:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>the complexity depends on the complexities of<em><em> f(n) </em></em>and <em><em>n ^ log_b(a)</em></em> (the log is to the base <em><em>b</em></em>).</p><p>The cases in the image below tell us which case we need to use here.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1470/1*fPnVzEh00aTSG3PCX2MnXQ.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The Master Theorem. From <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/master-theorem/" rel="noopener nofollow">brilliant.org</a></figcaption></figure><p>Since the value of n ^ log(a) base b is <em><em>n</em></em>², while the term <em><em>f(n) </em></em>is of constant complexity, we use <strong><strong>Case 1, </strong></strong>which ultimately tells us that our algorithm has an order of <strong><strong><em><em>n</em></em>²</strong></strong>. In other words, the time complexity of our algorithm is <strong><strong>O(<em><em>n</em></em>²).</strong></strong></p><h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2><p>Initially, each square is represented by a 0. A ‘-1’ represents a defective square, and would appear black in the plots. Each trionimo would be displayed with a unique number, which would be incremented as more trionimos are added.</p><p>Again, the goal of the code is not optimization — its to do as much from scratch (in plain python) as possible.</p><p>I have commented the code below, so it should be pretty straight-forward.</p><h3 id="importing-required-libraries">Importing required libraries</h3><pre><code>from random import randint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np </code></pre><p>The <code>random</code> library is used to randomly pick a square to be defective, just for starting the problem, and <code>seaborn</code> is, of course, for the visualization.</p><h3 id="creating-the-board">Creating the board</h3><p>Nothing too crazy: just creating a two dimensional Python list.

It's entirely hands-on.</p>
<p>Docker has made it easier to develop and package applications in reproducible environments. With Docker, you worry less about the infrastructure of your local machine and that of the production environment and worry more about worry about your code. Although a good product, sometimes when building you would want to run different parts of an application using Docker. What this means is you will create a couple of Dockerfiles and manage them. You <em>orchestrate</em> the containers yourself. This makes maintaining them both hectic and time-consuming. </p>
<p>Docker Compose is a tool used to run many Docker containers representing different parts of an application. To define and configure services (applications) with Compose, you use YAML files. The tool creates, starts, and stops these services that run as Docker containers. Docker Compose is great for rapid prototyping of microservices and continuous integration pipelines.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="sample-application">Sample Application</h2>
<p>Let's look at a docker-compose file with MYSQL configurations, call it <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. </p>
<pre><code>services:
  mysql:
    image: <span>"mysql:8.0"</span>
    container_name: mysql
    restart: always
    ports:
      - <span>"3300:3306"</span>
    volumes:
      - dbdata:/<span>var</span>/lib/mysql/<span>data</span>
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=database
      - MYSQL_USER=user
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=password1212
      - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
volumes:
  dbdata:
</code></pre><h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<p>The above YAML file has some things to note.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>service</em> called <code>mysql</code> is created, and it depends on the <code>mysql:8.0</code> published image on Docker Hub.</li>
<li>The local port <em>3300</em> maps to the container port 3306 to enable assess the MySQL container from the 3300 port. </li>
<li>The restart policy is set to always restart an exited container.</li>
<li>We define a docker volume which ensures data is persistent so we keep our data after the shut down of a container. It is important because Docker data is <em>ephemeral</em>.</li>
<li>Environment variables are also defined to adjust the configuration (login details) of the MySQL instance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-interaction">Web Interaction</h3>
<p>Flask microframework is used to interact with the database. To create this, follow the instructions below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder called <code>python</code> and change directories into it.</li>
<li>Create a file called <code>app.py</code> that connects with the MYSQL container and processes inputs</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> Flask, render_template, request
<span>import</span> mysql.connector
<span>import</span> json

app = Flask(__name__)

    <span>'database'</span>: <span>'data'</span>,
    <span>'auth_plugin'</span>:<span>'mysql_native_password'</span>

        details = request.form
        firstName = details[<span>'fname'</span>]
        lastName = details[<span>'lname'</span>]
        cur = connection.cursor()
        cur.execute(<span>"INSERT INTO MyUsers(firstName, lastName) \
        VALUES (%s, %s)"</span>, (firstName, lastName))
        mysql.connection.commit()

<span>&lt;/<span>HTML</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a Dockerfile to build a python image with the above files, <code>Dockerfile</code> with the following contents</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span> python:<span>3</span>.<span>6</span>-alpine3.<span>11</span>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <em>build</em> directs docker to the folder(context) <code>python</code> and builds a docker image from the Dockerfile in the folder.</li>
<li>The <em>volume</em> is edited to initialize the MYSQL container with our <code>init.sql</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project should have the structure below:</p>
<pre><code>├── docker-compose.yml
├── init.sql
└── python
    ├── app.py
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── index.html
    └── requirements.txt

<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>To execute the above block, run <code>docker-compose up</code> on your terminal and access the HTML on <code>localhost:5000</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have seen how Docker Compose works and some basic explanations. Things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Docker manages single containers while Docker Compose manages multiple container applications.</li>
<li>Docker Compose is good for development, testing, and staging environments but in a production environment, you would be better off using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.</li>
<li>Environment variables and secrets are never checked into source control in a production setting. Use a <code>.env</code> file instead</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>
<p>ephemeral: lasting for a very short time. This means without volumes, data generated and in docker are volatile and will be lost on termination of a container (either a restart or a rebuild).</p>
<p>orchestrate: Container orchestration is the automatic process of managing or scheduling the work of individual containers for applications based on microservices within multiple clusters.</p>
<p>service: A service is a section that defines all the containers used by our application.</p>
<p>3300: The default port for connections should be port 3306, but for easier understanding of where local ports and container ports are in a file, 3300 is used. </p>

<![CDATA[Reverse Engineering: Marvel's Avengers – Developing a Server Emulator]]>
            </title>
            <description>

September 1, 2020 | https://krystalgamer.github.io/avengers-emulator/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://krystalgamer.github.io/avengers-emulator/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
      
      

<p>During these past two weeks I had the chance to play the Marvel’s Avengers Beta. The game allows the player to player solo or hop into matchmaking to find some squad-mates.
Even playing solo it was clear that the game needed internet connectivity. Having already played last week during the closed-beta I decided to use the new open-beta to explore more about the game’s networking.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I like reversing and understanding client/server communications is that the process is much more clear than other types of reversing, such as custom archives and formats.
The process goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand the type, the sender and destination of the traffic - who is responsible of sending it, whether it’s UDP/TCP, the endpoints, is it encrypted? …</li>
  <li>Acquire readibility and instrumentation - develop/use tools to dump the traffic to later analyze it</li>
  <li>Learn the protocol details - crucial for debugging, this can be done by omitting requests/responses, messing with the contents,…</li>
</ol>

<p>If the goal is to develop an emulator then there’s extra steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start by parroting the server responses</li>
  <li>Slowly build the backend and start making your own responses</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="understanding-the-traffic">Understanding the traffic</h2>

<p>I started by opening <code>Wireshark</code> and checking how my actions impact the traffic. During the game’s boot there’s nothing happening, pressing the <code>Start</code> button in the main menu the game performs a DNS query of <code>cry-trmv6-beta.os.eidos.com</code> followed by setting up a TLS connection to the return IP. This indicates that the protocol being HTTPS - it’s nice since it well known but it’s encrypted which hurts readibility and tamperability.</p>

<p>Having some experience with games that use HTTPS, such as <a href="https://github.com/krystalgamer/shakes_fidget_server_emulator">Shakes and Fidget</a>, it’s common for the client not to care about the server being HTTP(useful for dumping packets) or even the server allowing HTTP requests. I added an entry to the <code>HOSTS</code> file to redirect the traffic to my local server sadly the connection couldn’t be established and Square Enix servers only allowed HTTPS. This meant I had to dug deeper to acquire reading power of the packets.</p>

<p>This part got me scared since the game uses Denuvo which contributes to its 400MB of executable size. I wanted to avoid messing its anti-tamper measures.
To verify where the traffic comes from within the game using <code>x64dbg</code> I placed a breakpoint at <code>getaddrinfo</code> in <code>ws2_32.dll</code>. When the breakpoint was hit reading the callstack showed where it came from, it was <code>osdk.dll</code>. This module was shipped with the game and until that moment I was not aware of its existence.</p>

<p>The next step was to see what it exports:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some of the entries were removed due to being too long. This was my breakthrough, this library is responsible for the communications and it appears to be done in JSON!</p>

<p>Digging around the <strong>strings</strong> I noticed it was using <code>libcurl</code> which is also awesome, but also <code>libuv</code> which could pose serious problems for debugging and tracing. IDA wasn’t picking cURL’s function names so I had to use one of the community FLIRT databases, <a href="https://krystalgamer.github.io/avengers-emulator/%3Chttps://github.com/Maktm/FLIRTDB">FLIRTDB</a>, which was key in finding functions such as <code>curl_easy_setopt</code>.
cURL has two interfaces the <code>easy</code> and the <code>multi</code>, the latter being focused in asynchronous programming. Even though it uses <code>libuv</code> all the connections are done via the <strong>easy</strong> interface.</p>

<p>Having the targets isolated it was time to add some logging. In this case I resorted to dll proxying which consists of substituting the original module with a one created by me and redirecting all the calls to the original one. Microsoft Visual C compiler makes it super easy with a simple pragma directive.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> <span>__pragma</span> <span>(</span><span>comment</span> <span>(</span><span>linker</span><span>,</span> <span>"/export:"</span> <span>export_name</span> <span>"="</span> <span>original_dll_name</span><span>.</span><span>export_name</span> <span>",@"</span> <span>ordinal</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case I renamed <code>osdk.dll</code> to <code>osdk_orig.dll</code>, the new module exported the exact same functions which just forwarded to the original.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL(exp_name, ordinal, target_name) __pragma (comment (linker, "/export:" #exp_name "=" #target_name ",@" #ordinal))
</span>
<span>FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL</span><span>(</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Free</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>osdk_orig</span><span>.</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Free</span><span>)</span>
<span>FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL</span><span>(</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Init</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>osdk_orig</span><span>.</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Init</span><span>)</span>

<span>(...)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DLL Proxying has also another big advantage, since <code>DllMain</code> runs before the main executable(the ones of the modules that are explicitly imported!), it’s the safest place to perform any hooks/patches. Other methods such as DLL Injection require creating an extra thread which might cause some racing issues.</p>

<p>Here I run into another problem, for some reason <code>GetModuleHandle</code> was always returning 0, except when the argument was <code>NULL</code>. Calling <code>ntdll!LdrGetDllHandle</code> also yielded 0 and even walking the LDR table from PEB(Process Environment Block), yield no modules which was extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>I was eager to to get my hooks running and debugging Windows internal structures was not on my best interest, because it might be caused by Denuvo! Being desperate I decided to try something that even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices">Microsoft discourages</a> from doing, calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> in <code>Dllmain</code>, the reason behind it is that it during the <code>DllMain</code> routine the loader lock is acquired and is not free’d until it’s over(also the loaded modules list must not change inside), thus loading new modules might cause crashes or deadlock.</p>

<p>Since my dll depends on <code>osdk_orig.dll</code> then it must be loaded after the original one, thus my call of <code>LoadLibrary</code> does not violate the condition of modifying the module list! Luckily it worked and <code>GetProcAddress</code> was also working. Using <code>osdk_Allocator_Init</code> as a pivot, the <strong>offsets</strong> to all the relevant functions inside <code>osdk_orig.dll</code> were calculated and relevant functions hooked. It was time to start logging!</p>

<h3 id="logging-curl_easy_setopt">Logging curl_easy_setopt</h3>

<p>Performing requests with cURL is quite straightforward, first create a <code>CURL*</code> handle with <code>curl_easy_init</code> and then set <strong>ALL</strong> connection related settings/parameters <code>curl_easy_setopt</code>. The function prototype is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CURLcode</span> <span>curl_easy_setopt</span><span>(</span><span>CURL</span> <span>*</span><span>handle</span><span>,</span> <span>CURLoption</span> <span>option</span><span>,</span> <span>parameter</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument was already discussed, the second one is an <em>enum</em> which specifies which option will be set and the third argument is the data related to the parameter. E.g with option <code>CURLOPT_URL</code> the parameter would be a null-terminated string of the url.</p>

<p>Hooking this function was done with a <strong>trampoline</strong>, which consists of over-writing the function prologue with something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>ADDRESS_OF_…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>How do small, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrap.asp">bootstrapped</a> companies launch new products? It depends, but I want to tell about Gikken's journey from buying the iconic Mac app for iOS + macOS developers, to conducting user interviews, to designing a new version from scratch, to deciding on pricing, and to prepping for launch day.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/08/confetti-cover-6.png"></figure><p>8 months ago, I shared exciting news that <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/we-acquired-tokens/">we bought Tokens</a> from another developer. Being a financially successful indie developer focused on language learning tools, we felt that we wanted to try a new area, to solve problems for a new community. When I started using Twitter over a year ago, I figured out that Gikken's brand had been underrepresented in the developer community, being a 5-year-old company. Could there have been a better match than to make a product for developers? We didn't think long when an opportunity to acquire Tokens popped up.</p><p><strong>Today, I'm thrilled to announce that Tokens 2 is out. </strong>It's an all-new version of the app that was once a marketing and customer support powerhouse for thousands of Apple developers.</p><h2 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h2><p>I discovered Tokens last year—later than most Apple developers. It was love at first sight. Having promo codes always at hand saved me hours of customer support work. Redemption notifications triggered dopamine even when redeemed by ordinary users, let alone popular bloggers!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/08/Notifications.png"><figcaption>Redemption notifications are one of the best Tokens features according to me and some other people.</figcaption></figure><p>Gikken-owned Tokens happened quickly–it amazes me. I asked whether <a href="https://twitter.com/denishennessy">Denis</a> planned to make an iOS app. He replied maybe, Andrew and I offered to partner up and make it together, and Denis got back offering all the rights to it.</p><p>It took us one call to decide. Denis turned out to be a super friendly guy living close to Dublin, Ireland and making apps for a living for over 10 years. He said he took over Tokens from another developer, <a href="https://supertop.co/">Supertop</a>. 7 years after the app was first released, it hadn't brought in any revenue. Denis said he didn't do any marketing and Tokens's monetization model was the worst imaginable fit for a small B2B market—low-hanging fruit. We decided to give it a shot. Money aside, it was an amazing opportunity to spread the word about Gikken among developers.</p><p>A few days later, we signed a one-page agreement. We have never mentioned it but Denis threw another project into the deal: <a href="http://tophatapp.com/">Top Hat</a>. We'd acquired two products. After we wired the money, Denis messaged me on Christmas eve to say he had free time and could hand over access to all repositories and accounts. I was in the office, why not. Gikken took full ownership of Tokens on December 25th, 2019!</p><h2 id="interviewing-old-users">Interviewing old users</h2><div><p>Even though to us it was obvious that Tokens had to be able to generate promo codes for IAP in 2020, we wouldn't have jumped on it if people hadn't cared about it. "Winners learn from losing," yet doing something that no one cares about demotivates even the winners.</p><p>The best way to figure out if people care is through user interviews. I had to interview app developers to figure out: how often they use promo codes, for what, how much of a pain was App Store Connect, would they be ready to pay for it, and how much. Andrew once sent me a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492180742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1492180742&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gikken-20&amp;linkId=a3a25b00a364100a35875a4991ae47f6">The Mom Test</a>–one of the best business books I've read. It teaches you how to conduct interviews that won't give you false hopes.</p></div><p>It wasn't hard to find people for interviews. Denis handed us over the full list of everyone who's ever purchased a Tokens license. No one can tell you more than someone who's purchased a product once. They know whether their workflow became better with Tokens and whether it was worth the money.</p><p>It was fun looking through the list. Surprising that a lot of iconic developers were among users. Developers of Flighty, Things, Pixelmator, Waterminder, Fantastical, and 1,000+ others once believed that Tokens could improve their workflow. In early January, poking around the old customer list replaced Instagram as a way of procrastination.</p><p>I started timidly approaching people I'd heard the most about. I thought why the heck not, they might ignore me or not, at least I can say I tried. To my surprise, everyone who I was reaching out to ecstatically got back to me.</p><p>The first interview was with <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/p/f56ce6e9-26f9-4640-a21b-b9f4adc59378/twitter.com/rjonesy">Ryan Jones</a> from Flighty and Weather Line, which was a goldmine of insight and motivation. Tokens 1 didn't support promo codes for IAP. All Ryan's apps are freemium, however, he was an active Tokens user. He was pulling codes from ASC and inserting them into the app manually to have nice tokn.co links and redemption notifications.</p><p>I could tell Ryan was interested in Tokens's future by the amount of his questions. It was me trying to figure out how he uses promo codes and it was him trying to figure out what would happen with his favorite product.</p><p>When I started using Tokens, I instantly noticed that I was missing it when I was away from my Mac. I couldn't generate a code to quickly share with someone on Twitter. We discussed the idea of making an iOS app with Andrew even before we finalized our deal with Denis.</p><p>Ryan told the same. I felt relieved when I heard that my experiences align with those of a another user. I told him about our plans: that Tokens 2 might be a cross-platform app that would synchronize via a Tokens Account and that you would use Sign in with Apple. He asked about privacy. I said <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/security/">Gikken's adamant about it</a> and that we would never store user credentials on our end—due to lack of the official App Store Connect API, we have to use user's Apple ID to make requests for pulling codes from Apple. He was excited. Following the call, Ryan kept helping us to shape the pricing strategy and UX.</p><p>I held around 15 interviews with users of the old Tokens in January. I approached people who I'd heard about because they were pretty influential in the community or those who were using desperately-outdated Tokens 1. I brushed up on my SQL skills to pull a list of them from the DB. A few generously agreed to jump on an hour-long call with me and others answered my questions in details over email. It provided a boatload of feedback and insights that we then had to process and shape into Tokens 2. All interviewees are now featured on our <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/credits/">Credits</a> page.</p><p>There were people who said they didn't need it anymore or that they'd quit the app business. Many things can happen in 8 years. We had a strong impression that, all-in-all, Tokens was a much needed tool. As I mentioned before, reviving a once cult-like product would go hand-in-hand with working with the amazing community in which we wanted to be more recognized. We had to relaunch Tokens with long-overdue features, rethink the pricing model to make it viable, and finally convince the community that were the right company to do so.</p><h2 id="before-doing-work">Before doing work</h2><p>We did planning and thinking. Do we need to rewrite the app from scratch or slap new features on top of what we'd inherited from two prior developers? How much should it cost? Does it need to be on the App Store?</p><h3 id="app-store-vs-self-distribution">App Store vs self-distribution</h3><ul><li><strong>30% cut + taxes</strong> would mean we have to give up half of our revenue, which would barely make it viable again. In interviews, developers were pretty aligned on all things pricing–something between 5 and 10 dollars per month was fair to them. Considering the small market, getting 2.5 dollars out of 5 didn't feel like a fair justification for spending resources of the redesign and maintenance. </li><li><strong>App Store invoices are bad.</strong> Developers have registered businesses. They need to submit invoices to their tax offices. We do it every month and we understand the importance of unobtrusive, easy-to-find invoicing.</li><li><strong>It wouldn't give us any spotlight value</strong> that Apple claims to give. Who on earth would look for a better promo code management system (we checked–no one). It's not an obvious thing that people learn about via word-of-mouth and it's not something they open the App Store for.</li></ul><p>We went with <a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>. We've been selling <a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/">Mate</a> with them for a while and it's proved itself as a perfect solution for selling Mac apps, plus it handles taxes, invoices, and licenses for you at a modest 5% cut.</p><p>If we were to port Tokens to iOS, we'd have to use the App Store. The whole Tokens for iOS story was pretty controversial from the beginning because it was giving access to Apple services without their approval (remember, there's no App Store Connect API). Chances they'd reject us were pretty high. We thought we'd test the waters by trying to submit Tokens 1 to the Mac App Store. It would have required poking around the old ObjC code and sandboxing it—we never went through with it. Instead, I got reassured by Ariel from <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/p/f56ce6e9-26f9-4640-a21b-b9f4adc59378/appfigures.com">Appfigures</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimShpakovski">Vadim</a> from <a href="http://nativeconnect.app/">NativeConnect</a> who successfully made it to the store with their apps that did the same thing as Tokens–use App Store Connect in a way not approved by Apple. A positive App Store review is an approval, isn't it?</p><p>The iOS app would rely on the Mac app in a way that it'd be a "reader app". You'd manage your subscription and create a Tokens account via Mac app, and the iOS app would allow you to sign in with Apple to your existing Tokens account and have access to your promo codes and generate new ones. Sounds like a perfect Netflix-Spotify-inspired 30% cut avoiding scheme for a service that doesn't need App Store's spotlight value that Apple claims to provide.</p><h3 id="from-the-ground-up">From the ground up?</h3><p>It was up to Andrew who's written almost all the code for Tokens 2. Since the original Tokens was written in Objective-C (we entered the app business when Swift was &nbsp;announced—it's not hard to guess what our preferred tech stack is) and used pretty outdated APIs (made in 2012!), he said we should. Plus, we had to change everything for it to support accounts and IAP codes.</p><p>It was tempting to try fresh-released (back then) Catalyst to avoid making two separate apps for Mac and iOS, yet there were more cons than pros and we went old-school–good ol' AppKit. Andrew was adamant that we couldn't keep torturing ourselves with NodeJS on the server anymore. He set up a nice REST API architecture with <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/kotlin-jersey-jetty-mongodb-creating-a-restful-api/">Kotlin + …</a></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

Late last year, we were faced with the challenge of modernizing our notifications system for end-users by making it fit for both the changing requirements of the industry, and our internal development teams. In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the considerations and learnings we encountered along the way. It will not be a deep dive into the language and its surrounding ecosystem, but instead I’ll offer a glimpse into how we approach language and technology evaluation and adoption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its then current state, our notification system was baked into some older parts of our service ecosystem and heavily resisted far-reaching changes. We also felt that utilising more modern, ubiquitous technologies like WebSockets would suit us better and provide our users with a more engaging experience – and well, let’s just say it had a host of other small problems that made it a prime candidate for a rewrite.</p>
<p>Now a rewrite does not require a change in technologies: we could have stuck to the more or less blessed stack of Node.js/Typescript for our back-end, but we realised an opportunity here try something new in a part of the application that is not necessarily on the hot-path.</p>
<p>In other words, we were in a fairly good position to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>We set off on a scoping and requirements gathering exercise, and managed to draw a circle around the features we wanted to build and deliver in due time. One of the themes that kept creeping up from our discoveries was user experience: the look and feel of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Our goal was to provide a slick, real-time experience to our users. There are a couple of technologies currently available that can facilitate this, but WebSockets was the most mature solution for this. The next steps were to track down some language and framework combinations that have significant support for long-running WebSocket connections.</p>
<p>Apart from UX demands, we also set some expectations from an engineering point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>There need to be strong primitives in the framework - with strong community support - for both building and testing persistent connections, queuing, storage, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If we have to fight the framework, we’re doing it wrong. It should be opinionated enough, <strong>without</strong> getting in the way.</li>
<li>If we can reduce moving parts, we’re doing it right.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these requirements in hand, we opened up the floor for any suggestions and sure enough, one option quite quickly gained traction.</p>
<h3>Why Elixir?</h3>
<p>Elixir is a fairly new language, but it runs on extraordinarily robust and battle-tested concepts and technology, at least by modern-day web development standards. It builds and runs on top of the Erlang VM, doing so — in part — by leveraging Erlang/OTP.</p>
<p>OTP, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Open Telecom Platform</span></a>, is a collection of tools, libraries and middleware that enable developers to build scalable, robust systems. It is the lower-level ecosystem supporting Erlang – and thus Elixir – development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider Elixir to be a niche language, albeit a very mainstream and capable language within that particular niche. It might not be the fastest or most optimized, but it commits to a few core tenets – concurrency, fault tolerance and isolation of errors, persistent connections – and executes on those really well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we selected Elixir based on a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developer Experience – Elixir has a reputation for not only being developer-friendly, but having developer experience and productivity at its core</li>
<li>Integrated feedback loop – Coming from Node.js, having the One True Way to run unit and integration tests, and have a very clean way of running these in parallel is refreshing.</li>
<li>Purpose – As mentioned above, our requirement was to support and build upon a system of near-real time communication. Many other technologies do offer some level of library support, but we were hard-pressed to find a better solution than the primitives and higher level constructs provided by Elixir and Phoenix.</li>
<li>Interest – A very enthusiastic engineer within the team took ownership of this project</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our first steps in Elixir</h3>
<p>Once we had settled on Elixir, we were ready to roll our sleeves and&nbsp; actually start building something. This is where the champion steps in – a person who not only shows interest in the topic but is also willing to coach and mentor their peers. In my experience, it’s quite risky to try to adopt something that no one in the team has any experience in.</p>
<p>In true champion spirit, one of our own team members took ownership of building the seed project. While he was busy tinkering away, we purchased some books, found some tutorials, installed the blessed extensions and started learning this shiny new stack. It did not take long for us to have <em>something</em>; it was missing a lot of functionality, but it was just enough to give us a taste of how the language is structured, how the web framework hangs together and how we deploy it.</p>
<p>Now of course, introducing a new stack is not all smooth sailing. It should come as no surprise that the cost of adopting something new comes with a substantial amount of minutiae that need addressing. We had established ways of running services within our infrastructure, and our job now was to slot our Elixir-based service into that infrastructure.</p>
<p>From getting logging to work, having a working Prometheus endpoint, and integrating with our internal authentication mechanisms – let’s just say we had quite a few boxes to tick in order to get everything to play nicely.</p>
<p>But in the end, we have something that works! So let’s talk about some of our key learnings.</p>
<h4>Clusters within clusters —&nbsp;Understand where Kubernetes ends and Erlang/OTP begins</h4>
<p>There are competing, yet complementary philosophies at play here. The application is running on top of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6Dl0iII9U" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kubernetes within Smartly</span></a>, which brings with it a whole raft of *stuff* – a scheduler, failure detection, logging integration, load balancers... everything <strong>and</strong> the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The application itself is running on top of Erlang/OTP, which in turn drags a fair bit of tooling and opinionation into the fray - failure detection, process management, supervision tree(s). You name it, it’s probably there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Valim</strong>, the creator of Elixir, has written in depth about <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2019/10/kubernetes-and-the-erlang-vm-orchestration-on-the-large-and-the-small/"><span>how these two runtimes coexist</span></a>, and at large, the technical aspect of his argument is sound. But what we’ve observed is that there are a few challenges with regards to expectations that needed to be overcome.</p>
<h4>Failure escalation — Come to grips with how failure occurs and propagates</h4>
<p>Our main competency within the team is running Node.js applications, and while a lot can be said about Node.js, it is not a complex programming model. There’s a script, you run the script, it blows up or keeps on running. Everything else is yours to manage and control.</p>
<p>Elixir really tries <strong>hard</strong> not to crash the entire underlying process, so it will let parts of the application crash and burn, after which the supervisor will reconstruct processes in your supervision tree based on configuration. Kubernetes does <strong>not</strong> get involved here, so our regular approach of finding out bad things are happening simply does not apply.</p>
<p>This happened recently when a critical part of the application was unable to talk to an underlying database, and instead of the usual symptom – pods crashing and burning left, right and centre, making our alerting system go off like nothing else – we were faced with an application that <em>looked functional</em> <em>on the surface</em>, but was heroically trying to stem the flood of dying processes internally. Needless to say, we added more monitoring and learnt our lesson.</p>
<h4>One is the loneliest number — Account for redundancy in a stateful system</h4>
<p>Traditionally, one of the hardest steps to take when scaling your infrastructure is to go from one to two. When vertical scaling is no longer a viable or preferred option, teams need to look at horizontal scaling instead. In the current landscape of Kubernetes clusters and small, disposable services, horizontally scaling your application has even become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>This puts the onus on us to design a system that can work in a distributed way. For all intents and purposes this would be easy if we were planning to run a simple request-response system, but we’re not: we’re aiming to build a distinct-per-user perpetually connected system. So the one thing we really don’t want to deal with is duplicated websocket connections, or having to duplicate our message handling. In short, all copies of our application need to be able to communicate <strong>with one another</strong> and pass user-bound notifications to the copy of the application that has initially established the WebSocket connection to said user.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is not an unsolved problem. Even more fortunately, a solution is provided within <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix</span></a> — the de-facto Elixir web application framework - itself. This solution takes the shape of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix PubSub</span></a>. At its core, this would allow our applications to communicate with one another. If PubSub is the API by which applications would communicate, it does not by itself provide the means by which information makes it from one application to another. This message transport back-end needs to be provided separately, and take the form of <strong>adapters.</strong></p>
<p>There are two adapters currently available, Redis and PG2. We could have chosen Redis, as we do have some expertise in-house on how to run this at scale. But that would have introduced another moving part to the equation, and we were keen to keep as much as we could contained within the application itself. So that brings us to PG2, a solution that leverages Distributed Erlang in allowing Erlang processes to communicate across servers. In order for us to have this ability, we have to lean on one final component within our toolbox, namely <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>libcluster</span></a>. This Erlang clustering …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>My drawing process is (nearly) always the same; I grab a pen, stroke the main lines of something I see, add detail, and shade. Afterwards, I make a decision based on how much I like the drawing and how much time is available to finish it—whether to add color or not.</p>
<p>I might get in love with the plain, black-and-white drawing and feel scared of spoiling the piece with watercolor even when I know color adds another dimension to the story told by my sketch. But I've been practicing.</p>
<p>The stress of coloring fades away the more I practice, and the positive feedback loop makes me color more of my sketches, improving my skill at the same time.</p>
<p>I've scanned certain drawings before and after coloring. This, apart from letting me keep a copy of the uncolored version of the drawing, might serve to train a machine learning algorithm which might learn <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/suggestive-drawing">how I color my sketches</a>.</p>

<small>2020-09-01</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-01T09:15:00Z -->
<p><a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-102-nerves-powered-mechanical-keyboards-with-chris-dose/">
        Chris Dosé was interviewed</a> by us on Elixir Mix. When he spoke about his work on a Nerves-powered keyboard I knew this was a
    project I wanted to try out. So I dropped into their dev channel, acquired the hardware (thanks for the help) and have done some playing
    around with it.
</p>
<p>
    So what is the draw of a Nerves keyboard? Well, you can program it in Elixir. That's a big one for me personally.
    It also means that compared to a lot of high-level languages driving hardware you have pretty strong performance
    characteristics, resilience and specifically with Nerves a lot of best practices for running embedded hardware.
    It makes managing firmware updates easier, it mitigates corruption on SD cards and lots more. As an Elixir
    developer the pure convenience of customizing the keyboard in my favored language is of course delightful.
</p>
<p>
    This post should help you try it out if you have/get the required hardware. The project is currently using the Keybow
    keypad as a prototyping platform to figure out how things should work while they work on the details of a full
    keyboard and it is a neat little gadget, whatever you want to do with it.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Requirements to try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Keybow kit, with Pi Zero (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4144">Adafruit</a>)</li>
<li>Micro USB Cable</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html">Set up Nerves according to these instructions</a></li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/ElixirSeattle/xebow">instructions at the xebow repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The installation guide might not tell you to go into <code>assets</code> and run <code>npm install</code> but I think
    you have to. I'm not going to tell you how to install Node and NPM because it varies. But you can probably find it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">around the Node site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you reach the point of having burned the firmware to your SD Card, congratulations. We are ready to play.
</p>
<h2>First firmware on the device</h2>
<p>So plug the SD card with your pristine Xebow firmware into the Keybow contraption and plug the Keybow into your
    computer
    with the Micro USB cable. Startup can take a little bit but it should settle into cycling through rainbow colors
    after a
    bit. It should also produce numbers when you poke it (the default keymap is a numpad plus some extras).</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>I don't need a single numpad and now I have two of them. Let's make this more useful. Open
    <code>lib/xebow/keyboard.ex</code>
    in your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Replace the default keymap with:</p>
<pre data-file="lib/xebow/keyboard.ex"><span></span>    <span>@keymap</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># THE NAVIGATOR!</span>
    <span>%{</span>

      <span>k009</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:up</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k010</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:end</span><span>),</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre data-file="/">export MIX_TARGET=keybow
mix firmware
mix firmware.gen.script
./upload.sh xebow.local
</pre>
<p>Sometimes the upload process can be finicky. You can always re-burn the firmware to the SD card instead using
    <code>mix firmware.burn</code> instead of the <code>gen.script</code>.</p>
<h2>The navigator</h2>
<p>So with the Keybow on its side, four wide. You'll have this fantastic navigation machine at your disposal.
    Top row are arrows, middle row is VIM navigation or GMail or wherever else the don't-move-your-fingers approach is
    used.
    Bottom row are the extremes of the first row.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Left</td><td>Down</td><td>Up</td><td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home</td><td>PgDn</td><td>PgUp</td><td>End</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Layers?</h2>
<p>So my plan for the keyboard just filled the entire keypad. But the xebow application supports layers, so you can do
    some
    interesting stuff there. I considered doing a chorded keyboard but I'm terrible at them and decided on this as
    something
    I might actually use. There are plenty of cool things you can do with Layers if you want.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>The folks in #nerves-keyboard (on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a>) are hard at work figuring out a real mechanical keyboard
    schematic
    that should be a very cool thing to own and play with. Most of the conversation in there right now is about PCB's, CAD and hardware layout. They are a welcoming bunch. So enjoy :)</p>
<p>If this post was good, or has problems that need fixing, let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
a non-tracking newsletter which tends to cover quality and sustainability in software.</p>

<![CDATA[First Impressions of GitHub Codespaces]]>

August 31, 2020 | https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/blog/2020/08/first-impressions-github-codespaces.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/blog/2020/08/first-impressions-github-codespaces.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Github recently launched their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github codespaces</a> service - an online, in-browser Integrated Development Environment powered by <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. This environment allows someone to quickly load a virtual machine and a complete code editing interface, that is all accessible within the browser without having to install anything on the users machine. If you are familiar with products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Amazon Web Services’s Cloud 9 IDE</a> or its predecessor C9.io this will probably feel very familiar.</p>

<p>As one of the lucky few who were given access to the GitHub Codespaces beta program I had the opportunity to test it out and offer my thoughts on behalf of the Aristotle team below.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>There were a few small changes that needed to be done to the <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Aristotle Metadata home page</a>, (including making this blogpost) and it was easy opening a Codespace to start working. Opening a code space for a project is literally as easy as GitHub says - click “Open in Codespace” on a repository and it does the rest - no need to configuring or decommission a server, its all handled for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-opening-project.png" alt="How to open Codespaces" title="How to open Codespaces"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Our website</a> is a basic <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site, and offers a great basic test of whats available in Codespaces already. Loading a fresh Codespace took less than 2 minutes, which is comparable to AWS Cloud9. As someone who used Cloud9 when it was still C9.io, Codespaces reminded me a lot of that - its a simple way to open an editor and a virtual machine for a GitHub project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces">documentation for Codespaces</a> is also great. What I didn’t know is that GitHub can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account">load your dotfiles directly into each new Codespace</a>, so your preferences (<code>.bashrc</code> and similar files) will follow you across Codespaces.</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing files</h2>
<p>Being based on Visual Studio Code, <strong>Yes, Codespaces has a Dark Mode</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-dark-editor.png" alt="Default Codespaces Editor" title="Default Codespaces Editor"></p>

<p>Although if you are using different browsers to open your workspace (which I had to do for reasons below), your colour scheme preferences won’t follow you across browsers. I’m not a regular user of Visual Studio Code, but it seems to includes all the standard features you expect from a browser, such as syntax highlighting, VIm and Emac keybindings (which work very well in browser), and autosave which is enabled by default, and I promptly disabled.</p>

<p>You can also drag-and-drop files from your local machine into Codespaces filesystem, and preview and edit certain non-text files in the browser, such as images, both of which are really handy for web development.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-emulator">Terminal emulator</h2>
<p>Codespaces includes a powerful terminal editor that seems to be based on a stock Debian image. The only thing I didn’t like is that separate terminals are accessed using a dropdown instead of with tabs, but this is a minor detail.</p>

<p><strong>Big news: Docker is here</strong>, and it works well.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-docker.png" alt="Docker in Codespaces" title="Docker in Codespaces"></p>

<p>One of my biggest issues with C9.io was the lack of Docker support, which was solved when AWS bought Cloud9 but comes with the extra complexity of configuring your Amazon machine. So being able to simply run Docker in the browser is great. Docker-compose isn’t installed by default, and I haven’t had a chance to see how that works.</p>

<p>The only issue I found with the terminal emulator was you can only paste with right-click into Chromium-based browsers like Chrome or Edge, <em>Firefox users beware</em>.</p>

<h2 id="serving-sites">Serving sites</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace">Codepsaces does a great job of handling port forwarding for you </a>, so you can simply start you server process (on a non-Port 80 port) and if GitHub detects a <code>localhost:PORT</code> combination it makes it accessible for you by clicking on the URL, as shown below:</p>

<p>Loading and reloading Jekyll was fast, and by the time I clicked the forwarded link or switched tabs to preview changes to the site, it was already refreshed. 
<del><strong>However, this is another Chromium-only feature the clikcable port forward links don’t work in Firefox</strong></del>  this seems to be fixed now in Firefox.</p>

<p>One other minor issue is you can’t open your site in a private window or different browser to view the server without logging into GitHub. This isn’t a huge issue, but if you are trying to view what your site looks like under different browser or when logged out it can be troublesome.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>This is amazing</strong> and may become my default IDE - as a co-founder who is spending less time as a developer, and more time in meetings, writing emails, strategy papers, letters and tenders, <em>this is just amazing</em>! Most of my daily tools are Windows based, so I’ve been spending a lot of time getting Windows Subsystem for Linux working alongside the rest of my daily workflow, which comes with its own headaches. So being able to quickly checkout a branch, make changes and take some load of my local machine seems very promising.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features here to review that I haven’t had a chance to look at, including collaborative workspaces, Git integration and connecting with a local version of Visual Studio, but from a quick glance everything works smoothly.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s an extremely quick way to get started on a project, and I look forward to writing an update after I’ve had a chance getting the Aristotle Metadata Registry software, with all its many dependencies, running in codespaces under Docker-compose.</p>

August 31, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/">last series</a>, I wrote about building a
Lisp interpreter. This time, we’re going to write a Lisp compiler.</p>

<p>This series is an adaptation of Abdulaziz Ghuloum’s excellent paper <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf">An
Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>, with several key differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our implementation is in C, instead of Scheme</li>
  <li>Our implementation generates machine code directly, instead of generating
text assembly</li>
  <li>Our implementation may omit some runtime data structures</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum">my implementation</a> for reference,
but note that it may be incomplete and also may look a little bit different
than the compiler detailed in these posts.</p>

<p>You probably have a couple questions, like <em>why Lisp?</em> and <em>why compile
directly to x86-64?</em> and <em>why C?</em> and <em>come on, another Lisp series?</em>, and
those are all very reasonable questions that will be answered in due time.</p>

<p>I want to implement this compiler in another language than Scheme because it
will prevent me from copying too much of the code from the paper. Even though
the paper doesn’t actually contain the source for the whole compiler (most of
it is, after all, left as exercises for the reader), I think I will learn a lot
more when I have to write all of the code by myself. I get to make my own
mistakes and you get to watch me make and fix them in “real” time.</p>

<p>I also don’t want to generate text assembly, but those reasons are a little
different than my reason for choosing another implementation language:</p>

<p>First, I think that would be harder to test: I want to have an in-process unit
test suite that compiles Lisp programs and executes them on-the-fly. Shelling
out to a system assembler like <code>as</code> or <code>nasm</code> would be somewhat error prone.
What if the person building this doesn’t have the assembler I need? Sure, I
could also write a small assembler as part of this compiler, but that’s a lot
of work.  Harder than just generating x86-64 directly, perhaps.</p>

<p>Second, I want to learn more about machine architecture. While <code>add a, b</code> seems
like one machine instruction, it could probably be encoded in 50 different ways
depending on whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are registers, stack locations, other memory
addresses, immediates, which registers they are, etc. Shelling out to an
assembler abstracts a lot of that detail away. I <em>want</em> to get my hands dirty.
Hopefully you do, too.</p>

<p>I chose Lisp because that’s what the Ghuloum paper uses, and because Lisp can
be represented as a small, compact, dynamically typed language. Many
interpreter implementations are under 200 lines. I don’t think this compiler
will be that short, though.</p>

<h3 id="background-knowledge">Background knowledge</h3>

<p>In order to get the most out of this series, I recommend having at least passing
familiarity with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C or a C-like language</li>
  <li>some kind of assembly language</li>
  <li><em>Abstract Syntax Trees</em> and recursive tree traversal</li>
  <li>no particular aversion to parentheses</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the background helps your focus be more on the bigger picture than the
minutia, but it is by no means required. I expect most of this series to be
fairly readable. If it’s not, that’s a bug and you should report it to me.</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-series">Structure of the series</h3>

<p>I plan on writing this series in installments where each installment adds a
feature of some kind. Maybe that feature is a new bit of Lisp functionality, or
maybe it’s a refactoring of the compiler, or maybe it’s a compiler
optimization.</p>

<p>For this reason, each post will tend to depend on the code and understanding
from previous posts. As such, I recommend reading the series in order. I’ll
still try to keep the big ideas understandable for those who don’t.</p>

<p>At each stage of the compiler, we should have a battery of tests that ensure
that the features we have already build continue to work as expected.</p>

<p>I plan on adhering to this rough plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compile integers</li>
  <li>Compile other immediate constants (booleans, ASCII characters, the empty
list)</li>
  <li>Compile unary primitives (<code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, <code>integer-&gt;char</code>, <code>char-&gt;integer</code>,
<code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile binary primitives (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>=</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile local variables (<code>let</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile conditional expressions (<code>if</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile heap allocation (<code>cons</code>, strings, symbols, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>label</code> procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile closures</li>
  <li>Add tail-call optimization</li>
  <li>Compile complex constants (<code>quote</code>)</li>
  <li>Compile variable assignment (<code>set!</code>)</li>
  <li>Add macro expander</li>
  <li>Add extended forms using macro expander (<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Add support for libraries and separate compilation</li>
  <li>Compile foreign function calls</li>
  <li>Add error checking to primitives and procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile variable-arity procedures (aka varargs)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>apply</code></li>
  <li>Add output ports (kind of like <code>FILE*</code>)</li>
  <li>Add <code>write</code>, <code>display</code></li>
  <li>Add input ports</li>
  <li>Add a tokenizer in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a reader in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a Lisp interpreter (or compiler) in Lisp</li>
</ol>

<p>With optional add-ons also described in the initial paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Big numbers, IEEE754 floats, complex numbers</li>
  <li>User-defined macros</li>
  <li>A module system</li>
  <li>Heap overflow handler and garbage collector</li>
  <li>Stack overflow handler</li>
  <li>Improved code generation</li>
</ul>

<p>And optional add-ons not described in the original paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An intermediate representation for optimization</li>
  <li>Generate executables and write them to disk</li>
  <li>An interpreter with optional just-in-time compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that this is a <em>lot</em> of steps, and there are some steps
that I intend to take but have completely omitted because I want to roll them
into other posts. Things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code generation infrastructure (a writable buffer, <code>mmap</code>/<code>mprotect</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compiler data structures (variable environments, label environments, etc)</li>
  <li>Testing infrastructure (unit testing, integration testing)</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s really actually more work than I listed above. This series may take a
long time. It may take some twisty turns. It may take some shortcuts. But there
is good news: I’ve already written the compiler up to compiling heap allocation
(still working on procedure calls), and even if I don’t finish this series
there is still Ghuloum’s excellent paper to learn from.</p>

<p>We encourage you to read the author’s entire post titled, “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370434-fastly-great-story-terrible-price" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fastly: Great Story At A Terrible Price</a>.” He published his research just a couple of days before Fastly’s announcement of its intent to acquire Signal Sciences, so the stock charts, analysis, and commentary are timely and relevant.</p>



<h3><span id="Business_Model"></span>Business Model<span></span></h3>



<p>Like so many high-flying growth companies, Fastly leverages the “buy revenues” business model, which reflects market participants’ <sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2"> (a nontrivial number of entrepreneurs, management/boards, and investors)</span> psychology that is dubbed <a aria-label="FOMO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-we-seeing-a-fomo-rally-2020-04-06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FOMO</a> (“Fear of Missing Out”) and is under-girded by the Fed’s <a aria-label="POMO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanent-open-market-operations.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">POMO</a> (“Fed’s Permanent Open Market Operations.” </p>



<p>We understand this is our environment, so “when in Rome….” Or, in other words, “<a aria-label="don't fight the FED (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-dont-fight-the-fed-2466886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t fight the FED</a>.”</p>



<h4><span id="Buying_Revenues"></span>Buying Revenues<span></span></h4>



<p>For example, It spent 33% of revenue on sales &amp; marketing in the quarter ending June 2020 (<a aria-label="page 11 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page 11</a> of its 2Q 2020 shareholder letter). That’s called buying revenues, Dear Friends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Sales and marketing expenses were $25 million in Q2 2020, representing <strong>33% of revenue</strong>, up from $17 million, or 37% of revenue in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount and personnel related costs to drive future enterprise customer acquisition growth, as well as to encourage further use of our platform by existing customers.</p><cite>Fastly’s 2Q 2020 shareholder letter</cite></blockquote></figure>







<p>Nevertheless, this market environment as described does reward people and businesses that provide <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/do-you-need-a-contract-cfo-or-investment-banking-kiosk/" target="_blank" aria-label="services related to M&amp;A (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">services related to M&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/refinance-loans-restructure-debt/" target="_blank" aria-label="strategic finance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategic finance</a>, including Coventry League.</p>

<p>Regarding the latter pending acquisition, which is planned to close before year-end 2020, Fastly will use its surging stock market valuation (see above <a href="#fastlystock">stock chart</a>) to fund about 75% of the total transaction per the <a aria-label="press release (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.signalsciences.com/about-us/news/fastly-to-acquire-signal-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> and a brief deal overview by <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/30/fastly-acquire-signal-sciences-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" aria-label="Herve Blandin at The Motley Fool (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Herve Blandin at The Motley Fool</a>:</p>

Coventry League would suggest, “yes.”</p>



<p><em>Q: What was Icarus’ least favorite food?</em></p>

<p>Remember when Ihor Dusaniwsky, an analyst at <a aria-label="S3 Partners (opens in a new tab)" href="https://s3partners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">S3 Partners</a>,<sup data-mfn="6">6</sup><span data-mfn="6"> It’s a financial data/software company.</span> released a Top 10 Short Squeeze List back in November 2019?

<p>So, it appears S3 Partners was at least partially correct in that the huge short positions in Fastly late last year contributed to the massive <a href="#fastlystock">run-up in FSLY’s stock price in 2020</a> – in addition to the <strong>Covid Bump™</strong> that we alluded to earlier in this post.</p>

<h2><span id="Closing_Words"></span>Closing Words<span></span></h2>



<p>We used to think high-flying small software companies that sold for 3x trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue got a fair shake; if they got 9x or 10x TTM revenue then that was considered a home run. </p>

        <p>Web pages are ghosts: they’re like images projected onto a wall. They aren’t durable. If you turn off the projector (i.e. web server), the picture disappears. If you know how to run a projector, and you can keep it running <em>all the time</em>, you can have a web site.</p><p>But as soon as there’s no one to babysit the projector, it eventually gets turned off, and everything you made with it goes away. If the outage is permanent, the disappearance is too.

And I’m not even thinking about the fate of the Entire Internet. Just the small sites I care about, the blogs and small publications. It’s sad to think that when their authors are gone, all their writing will eventually disappear. (And don’t tell me about the Internet Archive—that’s just another backup projector, run by volunteers. We have no assurance that it’ll still be running a year or ten years from now.) Then, too, I also think about my own web sites. Babysitting that projector can be a lot of work sometimes. If it’s all going to go up in smoke as soon as I’m unable to work on it anymore, then publishing on the web seems, really, quite futile.</p><p>The obvious contrast is with hard-copies: things written on paper or printed in books.

We started with print books, he said, and by <em>adding digital publishing</em> we can create this much fuller realm of author-reader interaction. It’s a brilliant and well-considered <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">piece</a>. It has this flip-side, though, which we web publishers don’t often talk about: <strong>books can be improved by the web, but the web can also be improved by books.</strong> Digital publishing could use more “Immutable Artifacts”, because <strong>artifacts are durable</strong>.</p><p>Of course there’s a reason why, in all our discussion about CMSs, about design, markup, semantics, and programming, we almost never include books. The <em>tools</em> we use don’t even consider book publication, much less integrate it. But they could. And that’s what this website, <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/index.html"><em>Secretary of Foreign Relations</em></a>, is really about.</p><p><span>This site</span> is basically a rough, first-effort experiment in creating a mini-publication that realizes both sides of Craig’s diagram above. It exists simultaneously as a web site <em>and</em> as a printed, bound book—a book that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/152396216X">you can order right now</a> and have delivered to your door.<label for="-906686242337141937"></label><span>This being a basic proof-of-concept, the book’s cover is extremely generic, and the price is set as low as Amazon KDP will allow me to go ($5.38 in this case). At this point, only the content in the <em>Flatland</em> portion of the site is included in the print edition.</span></p><p>What do I mean by “exists simultaneously”? I mean that the production of the printed book is, for the most part, not some separate workflow from the production of the web site. I’m not copying text from the web site and pasting it into InDesign, for example. When I enter the command to generate the HTML files that make up this site, the complete PDF file for the book is generated at the same time, from the same source and by the same software.<label for="-2475282464837853604"></label><span>See more details on the <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/colophon.html">Colophon</a> page and on <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">the project’s Github repository</a>.</span> I can upload this PDF file to Amazon KDP, who will print a copy for anyone who cares to order it.</p><p>Why a book? Of course anyone can load a web page in their browser and send it to their inkjet printer. But, seriously: no one does that, even for websites they feel quite attached to. Even if they did, and even if the printout looked really nice (very much not the norm for web pages), who wants to save a sheaf of loose papers? A book is the best kind of printed artifact, and with print-on-demand services you can have them made with reasonable quality at a very low cost.</p><p><span>So here’s</span> how this will play out. After I reimplement my other web sites using this system, I’ll be making book editions of those sites available for free to anyone who cares to request a copy<label for="-2781867892142790827"></label><span>This was what I had in mind originally with my <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/article/the-annual-yarn-2011"><em>Annual Yarn</em> project</a>, which I hope to resume.</span>. This is a win for both sides. The reader gets a permanent, well-designed copy of something they have enjoyed. And <em>I</em> get the satisfaction of knowing those books are out there, being held in various places by people who (at least somewhat) care about them. The point is not to make money selling books, but to sow the writing as far as it can go—even knowing it has very narrow appeal and no market value. It’s a way to write purely for the joy of it, and still know that the work will easily outlive me. My writing will not depend for its continuance on someone maintaining backups and complicated hosting arrangements.</p><p>So much for my own stuff. But my larger, longer-shot hope is that others will start thinking about doing this too: <em>building</em> and <em>making use of</em> tools that integrate print publishing with web publishing. This goes back to the concern I talked about earlier. I don’t want the writing on small, independent sites to disappear. Not only do I want it not to disappear, there’s a good deal of it that I would like to have on my bookshelf. Some of those authors and those sites are gone already.<label for="-3393301825901819575"></label><span>“I don’t know Mark Pilgrim personally. I only know his work and it’s excellent.

The services and technology we need are already sitting there, ready to print those books for us. Supposing we were able to adopt this kind of approach, it’s easy to suppose we could develop a culture of sharing our books with each other. Our writing would be durable again.

          <p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/">recently announced</a> it was adopting <a href="https://wicg.github.io/sms-one-time-codes/#origin-bound-one-time-codes">a draft standard for the format of SMS one-time passwords</a> (e.g. two-factor authentication codes) to help thwart phishing attacks.</p>
        </div><div>
          <p><strong>SMS Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Before we get to the details it’s important to note that using SMS for one-time passwords is <strong>less secure</strong> than using a dedicated app such as <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> as the approach is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-swap attacks</a>. They’re also l<strong>ess convenient</strong> – sometimes the messages take a while to arrive and won’t be received at all if the user is out of mobile phone range or has swapped their SIM card while traveling overseas.</p>
<p>That said, one-time passwords via SMS matter – they’re the most common way to deliver 2FA codes because they work with the technology that users already have. Downloading a dedicated app just to manage 2FA codes is beyond many users.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind the standard is a predefined SMS (text message) format that looks like this:</p>
        </div><figure>

  </p>

          
        </figure><div>
          <p>The last line <strong>must </strong>match the format above, starting with <code>@</code> and in the format <code> @origin #code</code>.</p>
<p>Devices can then interpret this as an unambiguous one-time password. On your web app, you specify:</p>

  </p>

          
        </figure><p>The browser can match the origin of the site <code>(example.com)</code> against the message received, and then autofill this value for the user.</p><div><figure>

  </p>

          
        </figure></div><div>
          <p>Some mobile browsers already do this (Safari, for instance) but do so via guesswork and without any guarantee that the one-time password (OTP) you just received belongs to the right site. Without the <code>origin</code>, a phishing site could simply implement the <code>autocomplete="one-time-code"</code> on a bogus site to collect the OTP.</p>
<p><strong>Status of the Standard</strong></p>
<p>This is a draft standard published by Apple and Google earlier this year. Support seems to be growing. <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub adopted it</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;Draft standards can and do change, so make sure to do an up-to-date assessment before you attempt to implement it. (And, if you haven’t already, consider using an identity provider to handle this concern for you. Designing and building secure authentication is hard to do well and often not what differentiates your app.)</p>

    <p>I watched the talk
“<a href="https://vimeo.com/230142234">Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and beyond</a>”
by Bryan Cantrill, and I think he was able to put into words something I already
felt for some time: if there’s no piece of software out there that reflects your
values, it’s time for you to build that software<sup id="fnref:talk-time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:talk-time">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with what he said, because this is already happening to me. I
long for a database with a certain set of values, and for a few years I was just
waiting for someone to finally write it. After watching his talk, Bryan is
saying to me: “time to stop waiting, and start writing it yourself”.</p>

<p>So let me try to give an overview of such database, and go over its values.</p>



<p>I want a database that allows me to create decentralized client-side
applications that can sync data.</p>

<p>The best one-line description I can give right now is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s sort of like PouchDB, Git, Datomic, SQLite and Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more descriptive version could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An embedded, immutable, syncable relational database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s go over what I mean by each of those aspects one by one.</p>



<p>I think the server-side database landscape is diverse and mature enough for
my needs (even though I end up choosing SQLite most of the time), and what I’m
after is a database to be embedded on client-side applications itself, be it
desktop, browser, mobile, etc.</p>

<p>The purpose of such database is not to keep some local cache of data in case of
lost connectivity: we have good solutions for that already. It should serve as
the source of truth, and allow the application to work on top of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html"><strong>SQLite</strong></a> is a great example of that: it is a very powerful
relational database that runs <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">almost anywhere</a>. What I miss
from it that SQLite doesn’t provide is the ability to run it on the browser:
even though you could compile it to WebAssembly, it assumes a POSIX filesystem
that would have to be emulated.</p>

<p><a href="https://pouchdb.com/"><strong>PouchDB</strong></a> is another great example: it’s a full reimplementation of
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> that targets JavaScript environments, mainly the browser and
Node.js. However I want a tool that can be deployed anywhere, and not limit its
applications to places that already have a JavaScript runtime environment, or
force the developer to bundle a JavaScript runtime environment with their
application. This is true for GTK+ applications, command line programs, Android
apps, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mentat"><strong>Mentat</strong></a> was an interesting project, but its reliance on SQLite
makes it inherit most of the downsides (and benefits too) of SQLite itself.</p>

<p>Having such a requirement imposes a different approach to storage: we have to
decouple the knowledge about the intricacies of storage from the usage of
storage itself, so that a module (say query processing) can access storage
through an API without needing to know about its implementation. This allows
the database to target a POSIX filesystems storage API and an IndexedDB storage
API, and make the rest of the code agnostic about storage. PouchDB has such
mechanism (called <a href="https://pouchdb.com/adapters.html">adapters</a>) and Datomic has them too (called
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/storage.html">storage services</a>).</p>

<p>This would allow the database to adapt to where it is embedded: when targeting
the browser the IndexedDB storage API would provide the persistence layer
that the database requires, and similarly the POSIX filesystem storage API would
provide the persistence layer when targeting POSIX systems (like desktops,
mobile, etc.).</p>

<p>But there’s also an extra restriction that comes from by being embedded: it
needs to provide and embeddable artifact, most likely a binary library object
that exposes a C compatible FFI, similar to
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">how SQLite does</a>. Bundling a full runtime environment is
possible, but doesn’t make it a compelling solution for embedding. This rules
out most languages, and leaves us with C, Rust, Zig, and similar options that
can target POSIX systems and WebAssembly.</p>



<p>Being immutable means that only new information is added, no in-place update
ever happens, and nothing is ever deleted.</p>

<p>Having an immutable database presents us with similar trade-offs found in
persistent data structures, like lack of coordination when doing reads, caches
being always coherent, and more usage of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.datomic.com/"><strong>Datomic</strong></a> is the go to database example of this: it will only add
information (datoms) and allows you to query them in a multitude of ways. Stuart
Halloway calls it “accumulate-only” over “append-only”<sup id="fnref:accumulate-only" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:accumulate-only">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s accumulate-only, it is not append-only. So append-only, most people when
they say that they’re implying something physical about what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also a database can be append-only and overwrite existing information with new
information, by doing clean-ups of “stale” data. I prefer to adopt the
“accumulate-only” naming and approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> is another example of this: new commits are always added on top
of the previous data, and it grows by adding commits instead of replacing
existing ones.</p>

<p>Git repositories can only grow in size, and that is not only an acceptable
condition, but also one of the reasons to use it.</p>

<p>All this means that no in-place updates happens on data, and the database will
be much more concerned about how compact and efficiently it stores data than how
fast it does writes to disk. Being embedded, the storage limitation is either a)
how much storage the device has or b) how much storage was designed for the
application to consume. So even though the database could theoretically operate
with hundreds of TBs, a browser page or mobile application wouldn’t have access
to this amount of storage. SQLite even <a href="https://sqlite.org/limits.html">says</a> that it does
support approximately 280 TBs of data, but those limits are untested.</p>

<p>The upside of keeping everything is that you can have historical views of your
data, which is very powerful. This also means that applications should turn this
off when not relevant<sup id="fnref:no-history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:no-history">3</a></sup>.</p>



<p>This is a frequent topic when talking about offline-first solutions. When
building applications that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can fully work offline,</li>
  <li>stores data,</li>
  <li>propagates that data to other application instances,</li>
</ul>

<p>then you’ll need a conflict resolution strategy to handle all the situations
where different application instances disagree. Those application instances
could be a desktop and a browser version of the same application, or the same
mobile app in different devices.</p>

<p>A three-way merge seems to be the best approach, on top of which you could add
application specific conflict resolution functions, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick the change with higher timestamp;</li>
  <li>if one change is a delete, pick it;</li>
  <li>present the diff on the screen and allow the user to merge them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some databases try to make this “easy”, by choosing a strategy for you, but I’ve
found that different applications require different conflict resolution
strategies. Instead, the database should leave this up to the user to decide,
and provide tools for them to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)"><strong>Three-way merges in version control</strong></a> are the best example,
performing automatic merges when possible and asking the user to resolve
conflicts when they appear.</p>

<p>The unit of conflict for a version control system is a line of text. The
database equivalent would probably be a single attribute, not a full entity or a
full row.</p>

<p>Making all the conflict resolution logic be local should allow the database to
have encrypted remotes similar to how <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/">git-remote-gcrypt</a>
adds this functionality to Git. This would enable users to sync the application
data across devices using an untrusted intermediary.</p>



<p>I want the power of relational queries on the client applications.</p>

<p>Most of the arguments against traditional table-oriented relational databases
are related to write performance, but those don’t apply here. The bottlenecks
for client applications usually aren’t write throughput. Nobody is interested in
differentiating between 1 MB/s or 10 MB/s when you’re limited to 500 MB total.</p>

<p>The relational model of the database could either be based on SQL and tables
like in SQLite, or maybe <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query.html">datalog</a> and <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#datoms">datoms</a> like in
Datomic.</p>



<p>Now let’s try to translate the aspects above into values, as suggested by Bryan
Cantrill.</p>



<p>Being able to target so many different platforms is a bold goal, and the
embedded nature of the database demands portability to be a core value.</p>



<p>When the local database becomes the source of truth of the application, it must
provide consistency guarantees that enables applications to rely on it.</p>



<p>The database should empower applications to slice and dice the data in any way
it wants to.</p>



<p>Since I can’t find any database that fits these requirements, I’ve finally come
to terms with doing it myself.</p>

<p>It’s probably going to take me a few years to do it, and making it portable
between POSIX and IndexedDB will probably be the biggest challenge. I got myself
a few books on databases to start.</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll ever be able to get this done.</p>

    <p><strong>TL;DR: <a href="https://tweet.photo/">Tweet Photo</a> is a software service to automatically post your Instagram photos to Twitter. It started out as a Medium post, turned into a software product, and eventually got acquired for $30,000.</strong></p>

<p>Continue reading for the full story on how I validated the idea, built a simple product, grew it to thousands of active users, tried monetizing it, and eventually sold it.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="-blog-post-as-an-mvp">📝 Blog post as an MVP</h3>

<p>People always tell you: start with an MVP, prove there’s demand for your product
before investing all your time into something nobody wants. In my experience
that’s good advice, but it seems many successful products often start out as
accidental MVPs. Tweet Photo is a perfect example of this.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried posting an Instagram photo to Twitter, you might have noticed it looks like this:</p>



<p>Just a link. No photo. Useless. I don’t know the politics behind this, but I believe Facebook is the one that disabled the photo previews at some point. So now we’re stuck with useless tweets.</p>

<p>You can find many workarounds using automation services like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. Because I was unhappy with all solutions, I decided to write my own article in May 2017:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@marckohlbrugge/a-better-way-to-post-your-instagram-photos-to-twitter-7f3a04a37d89">A better way to post your Instagram photos to Twitter</a></strong></p>

<p>Turns out I struck a chord. To this date that post has been read 70,000 times. Over three years later it continues to get over a 1,000 hits per month.</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/medium.png#full" alt=""></p>

<p>If you read the post though, you will notice how complicated the setup is. So I figured there might be an opportunity for a product here. I knew there was an interest, but I didn’t know if I could monetize it.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until <a href="https://hi.yuko.im/">Yuko</a> posted <a href="https://wip.chat/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-repost-instagram-contents-to-twitter">this question</a> on WIP:</p>

<p><a href="https://wip.chat/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-repost-instagram-contents-to-twitter"><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/wip.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>She mentioned she’d happily pay $20/mo for Zapier to tweet her photos. That got me thinking, maybe it’s a product that can be monetized after all. Plus, I already got the leads coming in via the blog post. I could funnel them through to this new service instead.</p>

<p>Rather than further validating the business model, I challenged myself to build a prototype over the next couple of days.</p>

<h3 id="-building-the-product">🛠 Building the Product</h3>

<p>I believe in using the tools you’re familiar with, so I used Ruby on Rails to build the product.</p>

<p>Tweet Photo is technically quite simple. I’m basically glueing together the Instagram and Twitter APIs. I was able to do most of the work with open-source libraries.</p>

<p>I finished the product in just over a week during my spare time.</p>

<p>I initially went with the <strong>tweetphoto.icu</strong> domain name because it was only $1. That’s how much faith I had in the product I guess. But shortly after I decided if I’m going to do this, I might as well do it right and purchased <strong>tweet.photo for $130</strong>. It might not seem like a lot of money, but with all the projects I start things thing start to add up 😅. In hindsight I’m really glad I got this domain name…</p>

<p>I wouldn’t realize it until later, but the key feature I added was appending <em>“via tweet.photo”</em> to every tweet. This single piece of text would prove to be the driving factor of Tweet Photo’s growth.</p>



<h3 id="-time-to-launch">🚀 Time to launch</h3>

<p>December 12th, 2018, 11 days after Yuko’s post, I launched:</p>

<div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🖼👉🐦 I made a new thing called <a href="https://t.co/LMVsrPNaFV">https://t.co/LMVsrPNaFV</a> ✨</p><p>Automagically post your Instagram photos and videos to your Twitter account. Your media will be embedded in the tweet, unlike Instagram's built-in feature.</p></div>— Marc (@marckohlbrugge) <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1072869470866034688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2018</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>It got featured on <a href="https://betalist.com/startups/tweet-photo">BetaList</a> and
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tweet-photo">Product Hunt</a>.</p>

<p>At the end day of the launch over 100 accounts were created with combined total of over 100 published tweets.</p>

<p>The product worked! 🥳</p>

<h3 id="-growth">📈 Growth</h3>

<p>As time went on the userbase continued growing.</p>

<p>Unlike most software services, the retention of Tweet Photo was basically 100%. Meaning that anyone that signed up, was likely to continue using it for a long time. Once signed up, everything was automated after all.</p>

<p>Combine that with the “via tweet.photo” in every tweet and you’ve got steady growth:</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/growth.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here’s a screenshot of the <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a> dashboard showing how tweets are driving new leads to the homepage:</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/tweets.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We even got some major Hollywood celebrities using the service. In fact, Tweet
Photo came a hot topic amongst her fans. Driving even more sign ups.</p>



<h3 id="-monetization">💸 Monetization</h3>

<p>Okay, so we’ve got decent growth. But what about the revenue?</p>

<p>This was a lot harder. When I launched Tweet Photo I included a $19/year PRO subscription that would remove the “via tweet.photo” branding. I figured if people care enough about their Twitter profile to not want to show that link, they might be willing to pay.</p>

<p>People with more Twitter followers would pay more. After all if someone has a million Twitter followers it’s worth a lot more to me if they promote Tweet Photo in every tweet.</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/stripe.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I eventually switched to monthly pricing starting at $5/mo. I figured churn rate would be really low anyway, so it would be better to charge monthly. Paying $5/mo instead $19 for a year upfront is a lower commitment for the customer, but ultimately 3x the revenue for me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately MRR grew very slowly. It’s about $135 MRR right now.</p>

<p>I think the main problem is that the the free plan is already very compelling. So it’s hard to convince people to upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="-now-what">🤔 Now what?</h3>

<p>While I had plenty of ideas for improving monetization, including removing the free plan altogether, it didn’t seem worth my time trying to grow a product that’s only doing $135 MRR. Even if I could 10x that, it’s still a low amount compared to my other products.</p>

<p>So over time I spent less time and attention on Tweet Photo. It continued to grow organically.</p>

<p>Another reason I didn’t want to invest too much time is the inherent platform-risk of building an API-powered product. I was dependent on both Twitter and Facebook continuing to provide me access to their API. They could revoke it at any time and Tweet Photo might be doomed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Facebook did actually deprecate one of their APIs I was relying on, requiring me to upgrade my integration to use a different API.</p>

<h3 id="-acquisition-offer">💬 Acquisition offer</h3>

<p>In April, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevntz">Kevin</a> reached out to me asking if I was interested in selling Tweet Photo. He had a strategic interest with his other products <a href="https://creatorkit.com/">CreatorKit</a> and <a href="https://topnine.co/">Top Nine</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://marc.io/images/tweet-photo-acquired/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course the question of valuation quickly came up. Typically a SaaS product is sold for 3-4x annual revenue. In Tweet Photo’s case that would be around $5,000. But that didn’t factor in the many free users that required almost zero customer support, but drove continued growth.</p>

<p>If I were to sell it, it would need to be in the $xx,xxx range. Otherwise I’d prefer to just keep the service and see what happens. There’s always the possibility of another celebrity using it and it going viral.</p>

<h3 id="-valuation-of-30000">💰 Valuation of $30,000</h3>

<p>After some negotiation we ultimate settled on a purchase price of $30,000.</p>

<p>The first $10,000 is cash upfront with no strings attached. The remaining $20,000 is contingent on Tweet Photo making that much (or more) in revenue within 24 months of the acquisition.</p>

<p>We both ran the numbers and we believe that with the full weight of <a href="https://creatorkit.com/">CreatorKit</a> behind it, it seems very likely Tweet Photo will cross that revenue goal.</p>

<p>But you never know how things turn out, so this was a way to de-risk the acquisition for the buyer while still allowing for a higher purchase than you’d typically see for a $135 MRR business.</p>

<p>Ask me in a few months how things are going 🙂</p>

<h3 id="-whats-next">👀 What’s next</h3>

<p>The $10,000 is in the bank and we’re now finalizing the asset transfer.</p>

<p>In the coming months CreatorKit will likely start marketing it to their existing userbase and possibly improving the service as well. Since we still have a shared interest in growing Tweet Photo me and the CreatorKit team will keep in touch to see how things are going.</p>

<p>Personally, I will continue to focus on <a href="https://wip.chat/">WIP</a>, <a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a>, and <a href="https://startup.jobs/">Startup Jobs</a>.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has always been a weak point for me and after setting up Authy for the n-th time, it seemed as good a time as any to take a deep dive and figure out exactly how these time-based one-time password algorithms worked.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L93OYxu_Tn62xRpz0FsJyBeFNl8sp79Q4O-Wq2SPIC8rabc82VqubJNThDYX-vFl8TwOQSZwf7bDVzwyAxSD28jkRq0jiOtmFGmYhULpW8G8_vrGN89Z3NuOUC27z9pgyuQ8OuCT" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Examples of different time-based one-time password algorithm implementations</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Basic Overview</h2>



<p>At the highest level, the passcodes you see on these apps are created using a TOTP (time-based one-time password) algorithm. The passcode is generated by combining a secret key from the service you’re authenticating with and the current time. That’s why the codes always expire after a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’ve set up these apps yourselves, you’ll probably remember having to scan a QR code somewhere along the way. That was the transfer of the secret key to your device’s secure keychain storage. This algorithm is agnostic of your SIM card, cellular network provider, or the make/model of your phone which makes it preferable to texting the user an authentication code. The algorithm’s only considerations are the current time and the shared secret key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you create a new account on a service that supports TOTP, they’ll generate a unique secret code for your user account. Then, the next time you’re logging in, the website will run the same algorithm the client runs to generate a passcode. If the passcode from the client matches the one generated by the server, the user is authenticated and the two-factor authentication process is complete.</p>



<h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>



<p>I’ve always found it easier to understand concepts like this by looking directly at the code. Let’s see what we’d need to do to implement a TOTP service from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TOTP is built off of a foundational algorithm called the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP), which we’ll need to understand first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HMAC (hash-based message authentication code) is simply an algorithm that uses</p>



<ul><li>a cryptographic hash function (commonly <code>SHA1</code>)</li><li>a secret cryptographic key</li><li>a counter property (used to keep the client and server TOTP processes in sync)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>to generate a unique time based authentication code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the distinction between TOTP and HOTP/HMAC isn’t totally clear yet, don’t worry. The main difference between TOTP and HOTP implementations involve the counter property. </p>



<p>HOTP’s counter is generally event-driven – for example, a button press would change the counter value. </p>

<p>Instead, in TOTP, the counter value is set based on the current timestamp. </p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the end to end flow.</p>



<p>First, we’ll create a counter from the timestamp. To avoid any additional complexity, we’ll just use time since epoch which is agnostic of timezones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qnUpYNJC6jzwQHRa7fLcOSSX9Np-J4fUQLJujxqQ4SCIY79rLF_1OCVkt4Zv1yjAicMLlNriMRNxzkotqWDNO56eRxudqQvqmmRvxfRLUnUAECK0Lx9nvQY0npKNOObClF6rld0T" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>We need the number of Tx intervals to provide as input into the HOTP algorithm.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, the result of this calculation is to figure out how many Tx intervals away from the Unix epoch the user is. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>Here’s the Swift code thus far:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code> let secretKey = "digitalbunker"
 let counter = "53283545"
 let hmacResult: String = secretKey.hmac(algorithm: .SHA1,  counter: counter)</code></pre>



<p>Now, <code>hmacResult</code> is equal to the following hashed value <code>1OyZRjbfhe+8womld8xldXo5V9M=</code>.</p>



<p>Next, Let’s convert this hashed value to a hexadecimal string:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code>let data = Data(hmacResult.utf8)
let hexString = data.map{String(format:"%02x ", $0)}</code></pre>



<p><code>hexString</code> is now equal to <code>31 4f 79 5a 52 6a 62 66 68 65 2b 38 77 6f 6d 6c 64 38 78 6c 64 58 6f 35 56 39 4d 3d</code>.</p>



<p>This isn’t something we can ask the user to type in every single time they need to authenticate. Let’s see if we can find an easier way of representing this – a 6 digit code would be a great user-friendly alternative. </p>



<p>We’ll convert this hashed value to a shorter code through a process called dynamic truncation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dynamic truncation involves taking the lower 4 bits of the last byte of the hexadecimal string and using that as an offset into the string to help us create a 6 digit code while still remaining secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last byte is <code>3d</code> which means the last 4 bits belong to the hexadecimal value for <code>d</code>  (decimal <code>13</code>).</p>



<p>Starting at an offset of <code>13</code>, we’ll grab the next 4 bytes:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>31 4f 79 5a 52 6a 62 66 68 65 2b 38 77 <strong>6f 6d 6c 64</strong> 38 78 6c 64 58 6f 35 56 39 4d 3d</code></p>



<p>These bit operations are all part of the dynamic truncation process. We’re doing all of these manipulations to find a 6 digit code that is still as secure as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, we’ll convert <code>0x6f6d6c64</code> to decimal giving us <code>1869442148</code>. Since we just need a 6 digit code, we can take the last 6 digits <code>442148</code> and return that to the user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the server will do the exact same sequence of steps. More accurately, it’ll check the current 30-second interval, the previous one, and the next one to account for clock drift. If the server’s code matches the code the user entered, the user is authenticated.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>TOPT and HOPT are both well-respected algorithms, but it’s important to mention the limitations. TOTP values can be phished like other passwords, but the attacker would have to be stealing the credentials in near real-time. </p>



<p>If this is a concern, you can shorten the TTL of the code. Standard TTL’s of TOTP codes can range from 10 – 30 seconds to account for latency (both client and server-side), unsynchronized clocks, and for user usability – feel free to tweak the TTL to suit your needs. However, if the attacker was able to find the shared secret key, they’d be able to create valid TOTP codes at will.&nbsp;</p>

	People often ask me what I’m doing now.
</p><p>
	Each time I would type out a reply, describing where I’m at, what I’m focused on, and what I’m not.
</p><p>
	So earlier this year I added a <a href="https://sive.rs/now">/now</a> page to my site:
<strong><a href="https://sive.rs/now">sive.rs/now</a></strong>
</p><p>
	A simple link.
	Easy to remember.
	Easy to type.
</p><p>
	It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused.
	A public declaration of priorities.
</p><p>
	(If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?)
</p><p>
	It helps me <a href="https://sive.rs/no2">say no</a>, too.
	When I decline invitations, I point them to that page to let them know it’s not personal.
</p><p>
	Anyway, <strong>today</strong> the brilliant Gregory Brown announced that <strong>he added <a href="http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/">a /now page</a> to his site!</strong>
</p><p>
	I re-tweeted his announcement, and <strong>within hours, 8 more people made a /now page!</strong>

        <p>The machine that powered numerous Number Stations</p>
      
        <p>
          uberardy — 2020-08-29
        </p>
      </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>A few years ago, I first stumbled over some recordings of number stations and started reading up on their history. For most of them, we have pretty good guesses who ran them and for what purpose. One example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlrnAC7Y7Q">Gongs and Chimes Station</a>, known for its melody that got increasingly creepy over the years, the more worn down the tape got. What always seemed mysterious to me is the kinds of devices used to actually generate the spoken messages. Were they similar to electromechanical devices used for time announcements over the telephone, <a href="https://youtu.be/4aMqKr0D-7o?t=47">with multiple play heads</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESMfh72RJg">complicated tape mechanisms</a>?</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4buFLqjvTjA">this video</a>. And... It's <em>the actual voice</em> used by the <em>Gongs and Chimes</em> Station? What surprised me was how rather small, polished and complex the machine seemed. There definitely was a microcontroller in there, it had an LED display, and just in general seemed like a rather fancy device.</p>

</div>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/sprach-morse-generator.jpg" alt="Grey box-shaped machine with a tilted front panel. There are a paper punch tape reader, LED display and numeric keyboard with some extra buttons on the front."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The most important thing however was, I finally knew what to look for. Searching for "Sprach-Morse-Generator" (Speech-Morse-Generator) quickly got me to <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/index.htm">a page about it at the crypto museum</a> which also mentions its official name: "Gerät 32620" (Device 32620). The page also has some great information about the history of the device and the voice behind it.</p>
<p>What exited me the most was... There are actually links to technical documentation about the Speech generator and its companion device, Gerät 32621, which could be used for digitizing voice recordings and writing them to EPROM cartridges to use with Gerät 32620.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4061.pdf">The 32620 Guide</a></h3>
<p>I don't want to go over everything mentioned in these guides; if you speak German I'd recommend giving it a read yourself; but I do want to mention some things I found notable.</p>
<p>As input, either paper punch tapes, the keyboard, or a serial interface (RS-232) can be used. The last one is a bit unclear, it is mentioned in the beginning, but later parts of the document mention it as a possible future addition. Either way, the messages are transferred to RAM, from where they can later be transmitted. It can hold up to 3791 characters.</p>
<p>The language samples are loaded from an exchangeable cartridge which can hold up to 96 kByte, where they are stored as uncompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a> . They proudly mention the cartridges can be swapped in 10 seconds.</p>

</div>

    </p>
    <p>The number of words per minute and pitch of the voice can be varied, which explains why some recordings of number stations with the same voice sound a bit different.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Technical drawing of the display and keyboard. The display can show which message, group and digit is played right now.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur.png" alt="Technical drawing of display and keyboard: Display showing three groups of digits. Keyboard with numeric buttons, &quot;RES&quot;, &quot;STA/STP&quot;, &quot;<&quot;, &quot;>&quot;, &quot;MODE&quot;, &quot;INP&quot;, &quot;EX&quot;, &quot;OUT&quot;, &quot;CLR&quot; buttons."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<p>What I find quite surprising: The keyboard and output of the device mostly uses English words. A bit unexpected for a device developed in eastern Germany for use in the Soviet Union; I would rather have expected Russian there.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/flowchart.png" alt="Chart showing which buttons to press and what will appear on the display for inputting morse code."> 
    </p>
    <p>There are some pretty charming charts in the documentation showing some interactions with the device.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Bus chart of the whole system. Interestingly, it shows a second language module, although the final device only supports one language module at a time.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/backside.png" alt="Technical drawing of the back of the device, with power and data inputs and line output."> 
    </p>
    <p>On the back are a speaker, output to the transmitter and some status outputs and remote control inputs. These were probably used so the chimes and speech wouldn't overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also pretty detailed schematic drawings and lists of component at the end of the document.</p>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4062b.pdf">The 32621 Guide</a></h3>
<p>This is the companion device used for digitizing voices and writing them to cartridges for the 32620. It's quite astounding how complicated this device really is: It can either record words separately or all of them in one go, it automatically recognizes the beginning and end of the words, it can duplicate cartridges and it even has a UV chamber for clearing the EEPROMS on a cartridge to reuse it.</p>
<p>What's interesting: There are no photos of this device. It's unclear how many were produced, there may just have been one or two. The only things we know about it are from this document.</p>
<p>In its architecture, it is quite similar to the 32620, it has a very similar keyboard and probably the same display.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>One interesting difference: It uses German labels on the keyboard. Also, all of the text it shows on the display is in German.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur2.png" alt=""> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The documentation mentions recording up to 20 words. This also came up in the 32620's documentation, although only 13 words were ever used: digits 0-9, "Achtung" (Attention), "Trennung" (Seperation) and "Ende" (End).</p>
<p>It has controls for adjusting the 0-level of the recordings and amplification. LEDs show whether it senses an audio signal and whether it's clipping. The amplification for single words can also be adjusted later, from a value of 0 to 7. It seems like this doesn't actually change the recorded samples but controls the amplification level in the digital to analogue converter. This feature is intended for making all the digits similar in volume.</p>
<p>I find this a bit surprising, all of this is something that could be done with other equipment, especially since only two different voices for these machines are known: German and Spanish.</p>
<p>In order to check the recording, either all recorded digits or just combinations of them can be played back.</p>
<p>When programming to an EPROM, it transfers the start address and amplification for each word and the samples from RAM to the ROM and checks whether the values it reads back after programming are as expected.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a separate mode for deleting cartridges where the time to expose them to UV can be typed in via the keyboard. If the rom cartridge is double sided, the cartridge has to be turned around to delete the chips on the other side.</p>

<div>
    <p>For all of the different modes of the 32621, flow charts for the interface are provided.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The front also features various other indicators, e.g. for the different voltages in the device.</p>
</div>

<p>This manual also includes schematics for the device.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The EPROMS</h3>
<p>The crypto museum also provides dumps of the EPROMS for both the German and Spanish cartridges.</p>
<p>Having read the manuals, decoding them is actually not that hard: The data is stored as PCM, and the 32621 Guide mentions the time between samples is 125μs, which adds up to a sample rate of 8000Hz.
Loading the roms into Audacity with File&gt;Import&gt;Raw Data, you can actually already listen to them!</p>
<p>[Edit: Here are the dumps as WAVs, if you're interested: <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_ger.wav">german</a>, <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_span.wav">spanish</a>]</p>
<h4>The Header</h4>
<p>In the very beginning of the first EPROM, there are 64 byte of header information, containing the start address for each word and its amplification factor. For 20 words, that leaves just over 3 bytes per word, although they seem to just stick to 3.</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the header took a lot longer than anticipated. I found the 3 bits for the amplification value pretty quickly in the last byte for each word. The rest somehow had to be the start address or some offset, and possibly the length. For accessing the values in each of the 8K chips, 13 Bits for the address are needed. To select one of the up to 12 EPROMs, another 4 Bit are required. This adds up to 17 Bits, so one more than in two bytes.</p>
<p>To get around this, there are two obvious solutions: Stuff the one extra bit into the byte which holds the amplification level, or throw away the least significant bit for the start address, so just every other sample can be used as the start sample.</p>
<p>Two things made this really hard to pin down: The z80 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian machine</a>, meaning for 16 bit values, the less significant byte is stored before the more significant byte, but this doesn't mean they would <em>have</em> to store the values in this order. Also, the binary chip select value for the first EPROM isn't 0, but 2. I only stumbled upon that when looking at the schematic for the EPROM cartridge (p. 38 in the 32620 manual). There's also a really cute demultiplexer built from discrete AND and NAND gates for translating the chip address to the actual chip select lines!</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Isn't it gorgeous! Note how it only <em>suggests</em> the presence of the fourth address line for the chip select with that not connected NAND.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/demux.png" alt="The schematic for the demultiplexer built out of discreet components."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>My best guess to why is the case is the chip select address values 0 and 1 are already used to select some other components. But, at last, I think I found out how it works:</p>
<p>For each word, the second byte contains the 3 least significant bits for the chip select and 5 of the address bits. The first byte contains the remaining 8 address bits. The end of each word is the beginning address for the next word. That's why there are two extra bytes after the last word. This would have worked for up to twenty words, as there would still be 4 spare bytes to contain the end address of the last word. The third byte contains the remaining chip select bit, some mysterious bits, and 3 bits for the amplification level.</p>
<p>The remaining chip select bit is still a bit confusing to me: The German recordings don't use it, since they fit on just 6 EPROMs. The Spanish one has to use it for the last two words, but there's something odd happening with the values in the one before the last two words.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting: The German words all use the default amplification level of 3, whereas the Spanish ones use lower and higher values for some words. To be <em>really</em> authentic, you'd have to take that into account when playing the samples.</p>
<p>One last thing I was interested in: The Spanish voice uses the same word for "Trennung" and "Ende"&amp;em;"final", and they sure <em>sound</em> the same. So, is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>

	<p><i>August 31st 2020</i></p>

	<p>Are apps even that relevant anymore? This is a question that's been on my mind for a while, but has particularly come to the forefront with the recent Epic vs. Apple saga.</p>

	<p>Sure, video games like Fortnite and software requiring native APIs make sense as an app (for now). But, if you're not a tilt-your-phone rolling-ball maze game, why not just make your software a great mobile-optimised website instead of an app?</p>

	<p>Sometimes I feel that there's a mentality amongst new developers and naive businesses that mobile software must be in the form of an app. I can see why.</p>

	<p>When the iPhone launched in 2007, apps were such a step up from the clunky text-based websites on our tiny manual-buttoned phones, who could blame anyone for wanting to develop a beautiful full-screen app? However, with that excitement, I feel the idea of making great software for the mobile web got left behind.</p>

	<p>Developing an app is so much harder than building software optimised for the mobile web. Not only do you have the monetary cost of developer licenses and equipment (iOS devices) when developing apps, you also have a sigificant time cost involved for maintaining separate iOS and Android codebases, building &amp; deploying to real test devices, and the delay and scrutiny your app goes under before updates go live onto an app store.</p>

	<p>Once your app is live, you have the significant barrier of a user having to find it, then use their precious storage space to install it. Oh, and the app stores take a juicy 30% cut of your profits.</p>

	<p>Who is actually winning here?</p>

	<p>Increasingly, a trend I've caught myself doing is using the mobile website equivalent of an app. Instagram &amp; Facebook's mobile websites for example have almost every feature of their app counterparts, without taking up massive storage space on my phone and draining battery with their background processes.</p>

	<p>Even now with my own <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects" target="_blank">projects</a>, a well optimised mobile website beats an app most times. Who needs push notifications (and the effort they require to set up) when email notifications do the job just fine?</p>

	<p>In most cases, a great mobile website does the trick. You don't need an app, or the app store. We already have a pretty great app store and you're browsing it right now.</p>

I’ve been building Inkdrop alone for 4 years. Wow, how time flies! This is <strong>a plain-text Markdown note-taking app that runs and syncs across macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices with end-to-end encryption</strong>. It makes organizing Markdown notes simple without hassles. It’s initially built just for myself — I was searching for a replacement for Evernote, supporting code syntax highlighting and some other programmer-friendly features like vim keybindings and hackability, for a long time. Then, I couldn’t find the one and eventually decided to build it myself. The journey towards building a perfect note-taking app was so much harder than I imagined. But I stuck with it for 4 years and kept improving it. I learned a lot through this project and blogged about them. You can read my blog articles such as:</p><ul><li id="a8c4"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/how-i-built-a-markdown-editor-earning-1300-mo-profit-inkdrop-ddf6ad702c42">How I Built a Markdown Editor Earning $1300/mo Profit — Inkdrop</a></li><li id="df21"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/grit-46c57af01d6d">How I Kept My Solo Project Going Over 3 Years</a></li></ul><p id="a3b4">Last year, I worked on rebuilding the app completely from scratch in order to clean up its technical debt and it successfully paid off:</p><ul><li id="3d05"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.inkdrop.info/inkdrop-v4-is-now-in-private-beta-9ffc6d5a013">Inkdrop v4 is Now in Private Beta</a></li></ul><p id="62ad">This update is on top of those endeavors.</p><p id="b99c">Building a great editor alone would be extremely hard. Because there are countless personal preferences and nice-to-have features for developers. In order to deal with that issue, Inkdrop provides a powerful API that allows you to add new functionality or provide a new look to the app with a plugin. While I’ve been working on its core features alone, we’ve got more than <strong>100 plugins</strong> now! Most of them (&gt; 80%) are made by the user community, which is awesome. I’m happy to see people enjoying hacking Inkdrop. You can browse plugins from <a href="https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="fc8e">Plugins let me focus on improving the core features instead of adding many optional features. So, I’m encouraging people to create a plugin with plugin developer license:</p><p id="a830">You can use Inkdrop for free, forever if you created a plugin.</p><p id="ccd4">Okay, let’s get started by talking about performance improvements in v5.</p><p id="1cd0">Since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=466mxrWPk7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaling out the database cluster</a>, the data sync got slowed down for some reason. It was due to the bad network topology where each server was running in a different region, which caused the RTT to be around 166ms. I moved the servers to the same region but in different availability zones and that made the RTT less than 1ms. Now it syncs across devices <strong>3 times faster</strong> than before!</p><p id="1497">The app launch speed has been also significantly improved. Inkdrop is built on top of Electron and the old version needed 4 seconds to launch, which is very slow. I finally managed to leverage v8 snapshots to boost the startup time. As you can see, the new version launches 1,000 milliseconds faster. The slow startup speed is so stressful. But now, I’m very happy to solve this issue. Please read the following article to know how I accomplished it:</p><p id="c459">It’s so fast, as you can see:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*kMqBMLCvL4pa68DkePTkJA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4464">The toolbar icons looked kind of outdated these days. They were too bold for the recent retina resolution displays. Besides, the action buttons on the top of the editor were taking too much spaces which makes you uncomfortable to use in a smaller display:</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4672/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png" width="2336" height="678" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YXZnxaqetybMphgpxCn_MQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="3ca2">So, I decided to refurbish the icons and rearrange the editor action buttons to make it look modern and clean:</p></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4672/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png" width="2336" height="678" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*fYYPSKyGaRSoLHr8MsV7Mg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="2d28">You can toggle the editor drawer by clicking the three-dash button on the top right corner of the editor:</p></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4240/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png" width="2120" height="1206" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*jnz2rU8ftK3LX7Ql3v4R2Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="da0c">I used <a href="https://www.streamlineicons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamline Icons</a> for this improvement :)</p><p id="3a5e">As a developer, you will have many projects and side projects. As you get more projects, it gets hard to organize your notes in Inkdrop v4 due to lack of flexibility. Inkdrop should be durable to be always your place to jot down your daily hacking endeavors even if you’ve got a lot of notebooks, tags and notes. Towards this issue, in this update, I’m happy to introduce the following supported features:</p><ul><li id="339e">Pin notes to the top</li><li id="0e46">Find sub-notes in collapsed parent notebooks</li><li id="ca1d">Workspace View</li><li id="7d98">Remember sort &amp; order settings per view</li><li id="9b9c">Remember navigation state</li></ul><p id="6950">Let me explain the details below.</p><p id="4703">Let’s say you sometimes have trouble remembering which notes you were working on in Inkdrop. The “Pin to Top” feature allows you to make notes stick to the top of your notes list like so:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1480/1*L2LMs1NdhnyMdh1dm-9-kA.gif" width="740" height="432" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*L2LMs1NdhnyMdh1dm-9-kA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*L2LMs1NdhnyMdh1dm-9-kA.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*L2LMs1NdhnyMdh1dm-9-kA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*L2LMs1NdhnyMdh1dm-9-kA.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*L2LMs1NdhnyMdh1dm-9-kA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><ul><li id="b406"><a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/pin-notes-to-top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a></li></ul><p id="5e50">Before v5, the note list can only show notes directly under the notebook you selected. If you have a lot of child and grandchild notebooks, it was kind of annoying to grasp quickly what’s in a project. Inkdrop v5 supports listing sub-notes when the selected notebook is collapsed on the sidebar, as you can see:</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4540/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif" width="2270" height="1364" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*4vJUeRAI4quXS8uYJZ6JQw.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="075f">Notice that the note count badge on the right side of the notebook item on the side bar also indicates sum of number of notes in it when collapsed.</p><ul><li id="bd36"><a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/navigating-notes#collapsingexpanding-notebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a></li></ul><p id="7693">By default, the sidebar shows all notebooks, status and tags in your database. It’s all mixed together and hard to distinguish as you store notes about various projects. You may think you want to see only information about a project you are currently focusing on. Workspace view allows you to switch the sidebar’s view into a specific notebook:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1480/1*Ek_iGFLbPdDs1Zd-MZraJQ.gif" width="740" height="444" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Ek_iGFLbPdDs1Zd-MZraJQ.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Ek_iGFLbPdDs1Zd-MZraJQ.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Ek_iGFLbPdDs1Zd-MZraJQ.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Ek_iGFLbPdDs1Zd-MZraJQ.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Ek_iGFLbPdDs1Zd-MZraJQ.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><ul><li id="33f2"><a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/navigating-notes#workspace-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a></li></ul><p id="3572">Now it remembers sort &amp; order of note list for every view (all/notebook/tag/status) so that you don’t have to toggle sort order between notebooks.</p><p id="0523">While writing a note, you may frequently refer to other notes. So, an ability to quickly switch back to the editing note after searching notes is crucial for your note-taking. Take a look at the quick demo down below:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*7ZoPm0-O5Ckz4ZYJNsfjzQ.gif" width="480" height="270" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*7ZoPm0-O5Ckz4ZYJNsfjzQ.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*7ZoPm0-O5Ckz4ZYJNsfjzQ.gif 480w" sizes="480px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*7ZoPm0-O5Ckz4ZYJNsfjzQ.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="e69e">Plugins can be installed via <code>ipm</code> command but it isn’t that handy as you have to run it from a terminal app. I am aware of some people confused to use it. As we've got 100+ plugins, it is more important that we can install/uninstall plugins on the app. So, I implemented a GUI for plugins in v5! It's so easy to install/uninstall plugins without a terminal.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*68SiF0ZSz6x-it-C0kTHTA.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*68SiF0ZSz6x-it-C0kTHTA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*68SiF0ZSz6x-it-C0kTHTA.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*68SiF0ZSz6x-it-C0kTHTA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*68SiF0ZSz6x-it-C0kTHTA.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*68SiF0ZSz6x-it-C0kTHTA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="a575">It also supports auto-update so you no longer have to run <code>ipm update</code> manually:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1324/1*I1gIwrk_h57YLWURJXM-XA.png" width="662" height="398" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*I1gIwrk_h57YLWURJXM-XA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*I1gIwrk_h57YLWURJXM-XA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*I1gIwrk_h57YLWURJXM-XA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1324/1*I1gIwrk_h57YLWURJXM-XA.png 662w" sizes="662px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*I1gIwrk_h57YLWURJXM-XA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="d491">We’ve got so many improvements in this update.

            <p>
  When you start a new job, your manager has no idea on how you work and what motivates you. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I recently found out about a great way to communicate this information.
  </p>
  <p>
  When starting her new job at Toptal, Steph Smith created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I8Y4oNkrh1Ass32PNyzBYp3hL4scLiH7YWQmwvKxzlM/edit#slide=id.g602e881e99_0_65">personal user guide</a> on what it’s like to work with her. It’s just a google slide presentation - all you really need. 
  </p>

  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_userguide/frame_2.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  It details her strengths and weaknesses alongside other info related to how she does her best work. 
  </p>
  <p>
  There’s a bunch of stuff you could include. Here are a few things that come to mind:
  </p>
  <ul>
  
  <li>How you best take feedback
  
  </li><li>Advice from past colleagues you’ve worked with
  
  </li><li>Your favorite communication tools
  
  </li><li>Expectations when it comes to response time
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  More generally, tasks like the above point to a better employee onboarding process. The more effort you put into understanding how someone works and what their preferences are, the better work they will be able to do.
  </p>
  <p>
  Imagine your company did this for everyone in your team. I’d bet that would foster a much more effective work culture where everyone got more done. 
  </p>

<p><strong>A special edition of the Rakudo Weekly News to inform you all of an exciting development in the world of the <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku Programming Language</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The implementation of hashes in MoarVM has been replaced!  <em>Nicholas Clark</em> wrote a new hash implementation for MoarVM in the past months, which uses less memory and less CPU.</p>



<p>MoarVM had been using the open source <code>uthash</code> library since July 2012.  At the time it was the “Go To” hashing library for <code>C</code> – full of features and flexible – so it was the logical choice. Over the years it has been modified to remove the features not needed by MoarVM, and hence the associated code and overhead.  But the basic design was necessarily unchanged – it remained the “classic” approach to hash tables – “collision chaining”.  The internal structure is an array of linked lists – just like Perl has done, since Perl 1.</p>



<p>This structure is simple to implement, but ultimately dates back to an era when CPUs didn’t even have caches, so it doesn’t fare too well now that minimising cache misses is the key to performance.</p>



<p>The basic problem that hash tables need to solve, is that they need a fast way to map from arbitrary keys not known in advance into something that is efficient for a CPU to manipulate – integers.  You’d like to store each key (and its associated <code>value</code> data) in an array, but also you can’t make the array infinitely big, so you always end up with a trade off – sometimes more than one key maps to the same integer, and so you need to code to handle this.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution">Collision chaining</a> is the “obvious” way – a memory efficient way to store a variable number of keys that all need to sit at the same index in the array.  Operations need to walk all keys at the same index linearly, but keep the list small (grow the array as needed) and the performance is still good.</p>



<p>However the downside is that the keys you need to walk linearly are not adjacent in memory, meaning you likely have cache misses.  You could replace the linked lists with arrays (for more complexity, and higher delete costs), but you still have one pointer hop and potential cache miss.</p>



<p>With the increasing importance of staying CPU cache-friendly, a different approach to collision resolution is now better: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing">open address hashing</a>.</p>



<p>This is roughly equivalent to using a larger array than collision chaining, and eliminating the linked lists.  While this <em>reduces</em> the collisions, it doesn’t eliminate them, so you need some other strategy to handle them.  Usually this involves a strategy for storing the key/value pair in an array index close to the correct location, and searching all locations where the key <em>might</em> be until either it is found or the possible locations are exhausted.</p>



<p>Currently one of the most efficient approaches to this is “Robin Hood” hashing. &nbsp;On updates, it moves entries around to minimise the distance of all keys to their ideal locations, not just the key added or deleted.  Usefully, this increases the chance of CPU cache hits during lookups.</p>



<p>Regarding hash iterators: one fun “gotcha” is that the Raku Programming Language (as well as Perl) both specify that it is acceptable to delete the key at the current hash iterator position without problems. &nbsp;Fortunately it was possible to adapt the insertion and iteration strategies to permit this without needing any extra complications or overhead.</p>



<p>All of this is now available in the main branch of the Rakudo compiler.  If you have hash-intensive applications, please try it out with this (as yet unreleased) version of Rakudo.  And let us know of your findings.  Reports so far indicate 10% to 15% improvements in core setting compilation, as well as in roast testing.  But of course, Your Mileage May Vary!</p>

<h3>The Ricardus Manuscript</h3>
<p>The Ricardus Manuscript arises from Gordon’s work on key assumptions underpinning modern codes. It deliberately departs from those standard assumptions. It has been in the public domain for over ten years, and has never been cracked.</p>
<p>When Gordon was working on the Voynich Manuscript, he started wondering what a real code based on the components of the Voynich Manuscript would look like. This code is the result.</p>
<p>Another question was what a code might look like that was based on different principles from most modern codes. Again, this manuscript is the result.</p>
<p>This manuscript also demonstrates another point. </p>
<p>It was widely argued in the Voynich research community that Edward Kelley couldn’t have created both Enochian and Voynichese because those were too different from each other to be the work of one person.</p>
<p>The Penitentia Manuscript is very different from the Ricardus Manuscript, but they were both produced by the same person.</p>

<h2>Micrometer &amp; axe</h2>
<p>Tech upstarts have a propensity to live in two
paradigms. In one instance, they exist in the
founders heads, whereby there is little feedback
and changes are made to tweak things just so.
In the other instance, they exist in the market
and there’s no telling what pull users will
demand of you.</p>

<p>In a sentence, this feels like upstarts are
all about measuring with a micrometer and 
cutting with an axe.</p>

<p>And if your product suffers from a slow feedback loop,
whereby you don’t have the opportunity to have
constant tugs at what you’re building, then
the ever smaller the ruler and larger the
cutting tool become.</p>

<p>When there is gulf between the precision of both 
tools, you know you’re in a tough spot.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder so many upstarts
never get traction and ultimately flounder.
When you are forced to navigate on two desperately
different planes of realities, it can be disheartening
to want to deal with such Janusian pursuits.</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

<div><p>from the book “<a href="https://sive.rs/n" rel="tag">Hell Yeah or No</a>”:</p></div>

<small>2009-12-01</small>
<audio src="https://m.sive.rs/sive.rs.kimo.mp3" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio></header>

<p>
	Whether you’re a student, a teacher, or a parent, I think you’ll appreciate this story of how one teacher can completely and permanently change someone’s life in only a few lessons.
</p><p>
	I was seventeen and about to start my first year at Berklee College of Music.
</p><p>
	I called a local recording studio with a random question about music typesetting.
</p><p>
	When the studio owner heard I was going to Berklee, he said, “I graduated from Berklee and taught there, too.
	I’ll bet I can teach you two years of theory and arranging in only a few lessons.
	I suspect you can graduate in two years if you understand there’s no speed limit.
	Come by my studio at 9:00 tomorrow for your first lesson, if you’re interested.
	No charge.”
</p><p>
	Graduate college in two years?
	Awesome!
	I liked his style.
	That was <a href="https://jkimowilliams.com/">Kimo Williams</a>.
</p><p>
	I showed up at his studio at 8:40 the next morning, super excited, though I waited outside before ringing his bell at 8:59.
</p><p>
	He opened the door.
	A tall man in a Hawaiian shirt and a big hat, with a square scar on his nose, a laid-back demeanor, and a huge smile, sizing me up, nodding.
</p><p>
	(Recently I heard him tell the story from his perspective.
	He said, “My doorbell rang at 8:59 one morning and I had no idea why.
	I run across kids all the time who say they want to be a great musician.
	I tell them I can help, and tell them to show up at my studio at 9:00 if they’re serious.
	Nobody ever does.
	It’s how I weed out the really serious ones from the kids who just talk.
	But there was Derek, ready to go.”)
</p><p>
	After a one-minute welcome, we were sitting at the piano, analyzing the sheet music for a jazz standard.
	He was quickly explaining the chords based on the diatonic scale — how the dissonance of the tri-tone in the 5-chord with the flat-7 is what makes it want to resolve to the 1.
	Within a minute, he started quizzing me.
	“If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”
</p><p>
	“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”
</p><p>
	“Right!
	So that’s a substitute chord.
	Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone.
	So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart.
	Go.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	The pace was intense, and I loved it.
</strong>
	Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly.
	I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game.
	He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.
</p><p>
	In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.
	In our next four lessons, he taught me the next four semesters of harmony and arranging classes.
</p><p>
	When I got to college and took my entrance exams, I tested out of those six semesters of requirements.
</p><p>
	Then, as Kimo suggested, I bought the course materials for other required classes and taught myself, doing the homework in my own time.
	Then I went to the department head and took the final exam, getting full credit for those courses.
</p><p>
	By doing this in addition to completing my full course load, I graduated college in two and a half years.
	I got my bachelor’s degree when I was twenty.
</p><p>
	Kimo’s high expectations set a new pace for me.
	He taught me that “<strong>the standard pace is for chumps</strong>” — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up.
<strong>
	If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects.
</strong>
	And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.
</p><p>
	Before I met Kimo, I was just a kid who wanted to be a musician, doing it casually.
	Ever since our five lessons, I’ve had no speed limit.
	I owe every great thing that’s happened in my life to Kimo’s raised expectations.
	A random meeting and five music lessons showed me that I can do way more than the norm.
</p><p>
	Twenty years later, Berklee invited me to give the opening keynote speech to incoming first-year students.
	Go to <a href="https://sive.rs/berklee">sive.rs/berklee</a> to see it.
	Kimo knows how much he means to me, and we’re friends to this day.

<h2><a id="iOS14"></a><em>What’s New in Vision in iOS 14?</em></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC 2020</a>, Apple introduced some enhancements to its computer vision framework. It’s nice to see that Apple keeps investing in&nbsp;the field. Apart from hand &amp; body tracking, the updated Vision framework comes with other interesting features:</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ Trajectory Detection:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Vision provides the ability to analyze and detect objects’ trajectories in a given video sequence.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now, let’s dive into our topic;&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">body tracking with Vision.</span></strong></p>

<h2><a id="BodyTrackingVision"></a><em>Understanding Hand Tracking &amp; Body Pose Detection with Vision</em></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rendered2x-1591633443-1.png" alt="body pose detection with vision" width="385" height="366"></span></p>
<p>The Vision framework allows to <strong>identify the pose of people’s body or hands.</strong></p>
<p>It works by locating a set of points that match with the joints of the human body, from a given visual data.</p>
<p>As you can see in the&nbsp;figure on the right, Vision detects up to 19 body points. This generates a valuable input you could leverage on your apps (we will discuss some use cases later below).</p>
<p>The process of detecting a body pose from a video frame is straightforward.&nbsp;First, you have to perform a request through&nbsp;<em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/detecting_human_body_poses_in_images">VNDetectHumanBodyPoseRequest</a>.&nbsp;</em>This is how it looks like:</p>
<p><br>
Now that we have the body points’ position, we drew each of them over the frame, and we linked those points with lines. The following is the result:</p>

<p><iframe width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sv_mIVqBRHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">As you can see, it seems to be doing well, providing an accurate representation of human movement and body pose. However, it struggles a bit with dark pictures or clothes, such as Darth Maul’s suit. Definitely, the Dark Side of the Force is not&nbsp;Vision’s cup of tea.</span></p>
<p>We tried it with even more people on screen, also providing a decent result:</p>
<p><iframe width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EiSFJWqAvdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>
When it comes to <strong>hand pose detection</strong>, the request changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vndetecthumanhandposerequest">VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest</a>. The procedure looks almost the same as in body tracking. Instead of searching for full-body joints, it focuses on the ones from the hand.</p>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-10.40.35-AM-1.png" alt="Hand Pose Detection with Vision" width="1065" height="550"></p>
<p>Again, the overall performance is quite impressive:</p>


<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not everything in the garden is rosy, though. As we mentioned above, there are some scenarios in which body tracking is not as accurate. We’ll get to that in the following section.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a id="ProsAndCons"></a><em>Pros &amp; Cons</em></h2>

<h4><strong>The Good of Body Tracking with Vision 👍</strong></h4>
<p>➤ The APIs are easy to use and implement in your project. A programmer with basic <a href="https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/">AVFoundation</a> knowledge should be able to get this feature working in a few code lines.</p>
<p>➤ If the body or hand is being shown completely, either with one or more subjects on screen, body pose detection works well and provides a high accuracy level.</p>

<h4><strong>The Bad of Body Tracking with Vision&nbsp;👎</strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ In cases when the subject is looking sideways, and thus some part of the body gets hindered, Vision still tries to guess these parts’ points’ position. The result is not very realistic.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">➤ With poor lighting conditions or in dark environments, the accuracy is reduced a lot.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having said all of the above, we consider the overall performance to be very impressive. We find exciting use cases for this technology, integrated with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://orangeloops.com/2020/06/whats-new-in-arkit-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AR</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Let’s see some of them.</span></p>

<h2><a id="UseCases"></a><em>Vision &amp; Body Pose Detection Use Cases</em></h2>

<h4><strong>Body Tracking in Retail</strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-942687518.jpg" alt="ar magic mirror" width="400" height="267">Probably, one of the first things that come to your mind when thinking about body tracking applications in retail is the well-known “Magic Mirror”. These have been around for some years now, leveraging augmented reality capabilities. The concept of virtual try-on is not by any means new, but it could benefit from body pose detection by providing more accurate and realistic results.</p>
<p>For instance, thanks to Vision’s hand tracking, apps would be able to provide a better virtual try-on experience for hand jewelry or watches. In most cases, AR apps with&nbsp;that feature need to rely on paper wristbands or QR codes to spawn the virtual watch or ring. With hand pose detection, not only you wouldn’t need that, but the overall experience would also be more precise.</p>
<p>Surveillance and security would appreciate body pose detection features as well. By analyzing in real-time the behavior and movement of people with&nbsp;security cameras, along with the implementation of <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2019/05/getting-started-with-machine-learning-in-mobile-app-development/">Machine Learning models</a>, shoplifters could&nbsp;be spotted easier.</p>
<p>There are some real examples of this application, such as the Japanese <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17479068/ai-guardman-security-camera-shoplifter-japan-automated-surveillance">AI Guardman</a>.&nbsp;However, they had to depend on custom body tracking technologies, which are not always the most accurate solutions. Now, Apple offers their own framework for devs to work with, adding new capabilities every year since its launch.</p>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Sports/Workout Analysis</strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-vision-framework-human-body-pose-detection-jumping-jack-1.jpg" alt="Body Pose Detection Fitness App" width="400" height="263">With Vision’s&nbsp;new features and the capabilities of CoreML, there’s a wide range of opportunities for sports analysis. Players would be able to understand their performance better and receive feedback from it.</p>
<p>For instance, Vision and CoreML allow analyzing ball shooting&nbsp;in sports such as football or basketball. Players can see the&nbsp;trajectory, speed, and angle of their throwing, in real-time. As a result, practicing and improving gets easier. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/building_a_feature-rich_app_for_sports_analysis">Apple has released a&nbsp;sample app</a> that leverages these capabilities to showcase how sports analysis could work.</p>
<p>When it comes to working out, Vision is useful too. With body pose detection,&nbsp;fitness apps would be able to detect human movements, correct exercises, and also provide more complex and detailed feedback on the training session.</p>
<p>Are you doing your push-ups the right way? Is your yoga pose correct? Now it’s easier for your virtual coach to tell you.</p>

<h4><strong>Games &amp; Entertainment&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><img src="https://orangeloops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-vision-framework-hand-pose-detection.jpg" alt="Apple Hand Pose Detection" width="400" height="253">One of the fields that could leverage body pose detection the most is the entertainment/gaming industry. Now, AR experiences could become even more immersive by making possible the interaction between your body and virtual elements.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-daxzVxrQI">the Duck Hunt game from NES</a>? (Wow, the nostalgia) Well, what about an AR mobile game that leverages Vision’s capabilities to detect your hand, allowing you to use it as the gun?</p>
<p>Or imagine being able to pet your Pickachu in Pokémon GO, creating a more realistic experience with the creatures. The possibilities are several.</p>
<p>Games that make use of your body as an input, such as the popular dancing games, would&nbsp;also benefit from this technology. I guess that soon we will see tablets or mobile devices performing like the&nbsp;Xbox Kinect, providing similar gaming experiences. All of these could be possible by combining the strengths of Vision, <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2019/05/getting-started-with-machine-learning-in-mobile-app-development/">CoreML</a>, and <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2020/06/whats-new-in-arkit-4/">ARKit</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="FinalThoughts"></a><em>Final Thoughts</em></h2>
<p>Using the human body as an input has become a matter of interest for developers and tech companies, and it seems that Apple keeps investing in it. For instance, see ARKit’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29uNziYYZZ0&amp;feature=youtu.be">Motion Capture</a>&nbsp;that was&nbsp;introduced a year ago,&nbsp;or the recently announced <a href="https://orangeloops.com/2020/06/whats-new-in-arkit-4/">Face Tracking</a>. With the improvements and additions to computer vision frameworks, such as Vision, we have more tools over the table to leverage these capabilities in mobile apps.</p>
<p>As with every emerging technology, hand &amp; body pose detection with Vision has its flaws. It doesn’t work perfectly in dark environments, or if you are wearing gloves.&nbsp;However, the results in normal conditions, as shown above, left us a really good impression of what Vision can do.</p>

August 31, 2020 | https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/max-concurrent-socket-connections-node-express | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/max-concurrent-socket-connections-node-express">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
            

<p>Recently, I was faced with the challenge of getting as many concurrent connections as possible out of a single node.js instance running Express and Socket.io.</p>

<p>During the exploration, it was clear that there are a lot of bits and peices that need to be configured in order to get the most out of your application. These findings are documented below in hopes that they can be useful to your project.</p>

<h2><strong>Node.js</strong> Configurations</h2>

<p>A the node js layer, the following configurations were made:</p>

<h3><strong>1.</strong> Schedule the garbage collector manually</h3>

<p>If you do not run your garbage collector manually, you may run into issues where connections can be paused. While this is likely not going to cause downtime, it will increase the latency of your app when facing a large amount of concurrent connections.</p>

<p>To run the garbage collection manually, be sure to initialize your app with the <strong>--expose-gc</strong> flag. For example:</p>

<pre>  <code>
node --expose-gc ./index.js
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This will give you access to the <strong>global.gc</strong> variable which you can use to manually call your garbage collection. The following code works for me when inserted at the start of the process:</p>

<pre>  <code>
function scheduleGc() {
  if (!global.gc) {
    console.log('Garbage collection is not exposed');
    return;
  }

  let nextCall = 30 + (Math.random() * 15);

  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    global.gc();
    scheduleGc();
  }, nextCall * 1000);
}

scheduleGc();
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This will randomly run garbage collection between 30 and 45 seconds in an infinite loop and avoid any long periods of downtime when facing a large number of concurrent connections.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> Disable idle garbage collection &amp; increase heap size</h3>

<p>You will want to use the <strong>--nouse-idle-notification</strong> and <strong>-â€“max-old-space-size=8192</strong> flags. These optimizations will deactivate the idle garbage collection process and increase the heap memory for each node process to 8GB. This will give you initilization code that looks like this:</p>

<pre>  <code>
node --nouse-idle-notification --expose-gc --max-old-space-size=8192 ./index.js
  </code>
</pre>

<h3><strong>3.</strong> Use the cluster module</h3>

<p>By default, Node.js will run a single process. This is fine if you only have one CPU, but if you want to get the most out of your machine it is necessary for you to spawn multiple processes. In order to do this, use the cluster module in your node.js application.</p>

<p>When using express and socket.io your code will look something like this:</p>

<pre>  <code>
const cluster = require('cluster');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

  console.log('Master cluster setting up ' + numCPUs + ' workers...');

  for(var i = 0; i &lt; numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('online', function(worker) {
    console.log('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' is online');
  });

  cluster.on('exit', function(worker, code, signal) {
    console.log('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' died with code: ' + code + ', and signal: ' + signal);
    console.log('Starting a new worker');
    cluster.fork();
  });

} else {

  initExpressAndSocketServer();

}
  </code>
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the cluster module means you will need to make sure your socket.io servers are using the redis adapter package to keep in sync.</p>

<h2><strong>Socket.Io</strong> Configurations</h2>

<h3><strong>1.</strong> Use the redis adapter</h3>

<p>Since you are using multiple processes, you must make sure that your socket.io server is equipped to communicate between all of them. This is made possible by using the <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-redis" target="_blank">redis-adapter</a> and having a seperate redis server set up.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> Set perMessageDeflate to false</h3>

<p>Socket.io is a wonderful tool, but by default it will exhaust memory and never reclaim it due to this setting. This issue can be resolved by setting perMessageDeflate to false in initialization (There is an ongoing discussion about why it is set by default). More information about perMessageDeflate can be found <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws" target="_blank">here</a>. Your Socket.io init code will now look something like this:</p>

<pre>  <code>
const io = require('socket.io')(server, { perMessageDeflate: false });
  </code>
</pre>

<h2><strong>Ubuntu</strong> Configurations</h2>

<p>You will need to make some updates to your server configuration in order to allow for a very high number of concurrent connections. I am not primarily a sys-admin so my description on what these commands do is a bit light. That being said, you can look up all of them for more information.</p>

<p>Increase the max open file limit by entering the following in your server's shell:</p>

<pre>  <code>
ulimit -n 1000000
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Add the following to <strong>/etc/security/limits.d/custom.conf</strong></p>

<pre>  <code>
root soft nofile 1000000
root hard nofile 1000000
* soft nofile 1000000
* hard nofile 1000000
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Add the following to <strong>/etc/sysctl.conf</strong></p>

<pre>  <code>
fs.file-max = 1000000
fs.nr_open = 1048576
net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 1048576
net.nf_conntrack_max = 1048576
net.core.rmem_max = 33554432
net.core.wmem_max = 33554432
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 16384 33554432
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 33554432
net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 786432 1048576 26777216
net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 360000
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2500
vm.min_free_kbytes = 65536
vm.swappiness = 0
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Reload your settings with this command:</p>

<pre>  <code>
sysctl -p
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Update your nginx settings, open <strong>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</strong> and make sure the top of the config looks like the following:</p>

<pre>  <code>
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
worker_rlimit_nofile 65535;

events {
        worker_connections 65535;
        multi_accept on;
        use epoll;
}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Then reload nginx with: <strong>service nginx reload
</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nginx was a requirement for my project. While nginx is a very useful tool, you have a hard limit of <strong>65,535</strong> concurrent connections when using nginx. This is likely sufficient for your use case, but if you expect more connections on your service, you should remove nginx and increase the file limits on the commands listed above.</p>

Scott)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>A proposed class-action lawsuit has been launched against the federal government on behalf of Canadians who applied online for COVID-19 emergency aid —&nbsp;only to have their personal and financial information stolen by hackers.</p>  <p>The lawsuit alleges that a series of "failings" by the government and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)&nbsp;allowed at least three cyberattacks between mid-March and mid-August, but the public wasn't alerted until <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-revenue-agency-cra-cyberattack-1.5688163">CBC News broke the story</a>&nbsp;on Aug.&nbsp;15.</p>  <p>The Treasury Board and the CRA held a news briefing to confirm the security breaches <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cra-gckey-cyberattack-1.5689106">Aug.&nbsp;17</a>.</p>  <p>The proposed class proceeding claims the delayed detection of the hacks caused the number of victims to balloon to at least 14,500.</p>  <p>"The actions of the [CRA]&nbsp;are reprehensible," states the claim, "and showed a callous disregard for the rights of [victims]."&nbsp;</p>  <p>It alleges the agency's conduct was "a deliberate ... departure from ordinary standards of decent behaviour, and as such merits punishment."</p>

of at least three security hacks up until mid-August.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The CRA has blamed "a vulnerability in security software" for the online breaches, and has said it wasn't aware of the first cyberattack until Aug.&nbsp;7.</p>  <p>The agency and the federal government have yet to file a legal response.</p>  <p>The Ministry of National Revenue said it cannot comment as&nbsp;the matter is now before the courts.</p>  <h2>CERB, CESB benefits 'implemented hastily'</h2>  <p>Most of the victims of the security breaches were applying for financial assistance under the Canadian Emergency Relief Benefit (CERB) or the Canadian Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Both programs pay recipients up to $2,000 a month.</p>  <p>The legal action alleges the CERB and CESB were "implemented hastily,"&nbsp;without adequate security measures.</p>  <p>As a result, it claims hackers were able to steal the personal information of applicants — including social insurance numbers, home addresses, bank account details and tax information —&nbsp;and use the stolen data to impersonate victims, change addresses and direct deposit information&nbsp;and file fraudulent claims under the emergency programs.</p>  <p>The lawsuit alleges the victims have been hit with a double whammy:&nbsp;their aid applications have been frozen while the breaches are investigated, causing financial strain,&nbsp;plus&nbsp;they&nbsp;will have to guard against identity theft for the rest of their lives.</p>

<h2>'Stressed out and anxious'</h2>  <p>Three lead plaintiffs in the case, representing all affected Canadians, say they now live in fear their stolen data could be used for years by cyber criminals.</p>  <p>"I'm definitely stressed out and anxious because I don't know who has my information and I don't know who can get a copy of my information," said&nbsp;Ally Scott, who had applied for the student benefit.</p>  <p>"I am only 19 years old. I'm worried that I'm going to have to combat this issue for the rest of my life. And that seems pretty daunting."</p>  <h2>'Somebody, somewhere has gotten $4,000'</h2>  <p>Another plaintiff, a police dispatcher in Windsor, Ont., wasn't even eligible to receive emergency funds as an essential worker, but had her identity stolen and used to obtain benefits for two months.</p>  <p>"Somebody, somewhere, has gotten $4,000 of payments and I don't want that to be attached to my social insurance number, because I didn't apply for it. I don't qualify," said Anne Campeau, 52.</p>  <p>Campeau said&nbsp;she felt compelled to step forward and represent herself and other victims.</p>  <p>"I believe [the CRA]&nbsp;dropped the ball when they came to dealing with it," she said. "Sometimes you just gotta do something like this [proposed lawsuit] to get their attention. It's not right."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705829.1598840266!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/anne-campeau-a-police-dispatcher-in-windsor-ontario-says-someone-stole-her-identity-to-get-aid.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705829.1598840266!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/anne-campeau-a-police-dispatcher-in-windsor-ontario-says-someone-stole-her-identity-to-get-aid.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705829.1598840266!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/anne-campeau-a-police-dispatcher-in-windsor-ontario-says-someone-stole-her-identity-to-get-aid.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705829.1598840266!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/anne-campeau-a-police-dispatcher-in-windsor-ontario-says-someone-stole-her-identity-to-get-aid.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705829.1598840266!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/anne-campeau-a-police-dispatcher-in-windsor-ontario-says-someone-stole-her-identity-to-get-aid.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705829.1598840266!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/anne-campeau-a-police-dispatcher-in-windsor-ontario-says-someone-stole-her-identity-to-get-aid.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Anne Campeau, a police dispatcher in Windsor, Ont., says someone stole her identity to obtain $4,000 in COVID-19 financial aid.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Anne Campeau)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Compensation sought for all victims</h2>  <p>The proposed class proceeding, filed Aug.&nbsp;24 in Federal Court in Vancouver, blames the government and CRA for negligence and breach of privacy.</p>  <p>Angela Bespflug, the lawyer handling the case, believes there are more victims out there.</p>  <p>"A lot of individuals had no idea this was going on and their personal financial information was being compromised," said&nbsp;Bespflug.&nbsp;"I suspect it's a significant number of individuals, unfortunately."</p>  <p>If given approval to proceed, the lawsuit will pursue financial compensation for all victims to cover damage to credit ratings, the ongoing cost of credit monitoring&nbsp;and for mental distress, stress and anxiety.</p>  <p>No date has been set for a hearing, and none of the allegations have&nbsp;been proven in court.</p>  <p>Receiving certification for a class-action lawsuit can take months or years.<br> &nbsp;</p>    <p><em>CBC Vancouver's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/cbc-vancouver-s-impact-team-sharing-your-stories-to-influence-change-1.5413606">Impact Team</a> investigates and reports on stories that impact people in their local community and strives to hold individuals, institutions and organizations to account.&nbsp;If you have a story for us, email <a href="mailto:impact@cbc.ca">impact@cbc.ca</a>.</em></p>    </span></p></div></div>]]>

Language identification can easily help you understand your users’ languages and personalize your app based on them.</p><p id="ab14">Language detection is essentially a technique/science that allows us to automatically identify the language of a given text, be it English, Chinese, or many others. We can use machine learning for this kind of identification —and we can even do this inside mobile apps!</p><p id="ad81">In this article, we’ll do just that, with the help of ML Kit’s Language Identification On-Device API from Google.</p><p id="10db">Before we start building, here are a few potential use cases for on-device language ID:</p><ul><li id="cc59"><strong>Next word Prediction: </strong>Essentially, this task involves predicting the next word in a string given a previous input word. So where do we see these next word predictions on mobile? In core messaging apps for both Android and iOS, whenever we type something we get a series of suggestions for the next word (i.e. “smart reply”) based on the previous word. Once we know the language of the previous word, we can simply identify the language and then predict the next word in that language.</li><li id="131e"><strong>Spell Checker</strong>: Language ID could also improve spell-check systems. Once we know the language of the query a user makes, then we can apply a spell checker in that specific language, and thus it will improve the spell checker’s speed and efficiency as well.</li></ul></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="28e3">ML Kit is essentially a cross-platform mobile SDK (Android and iOS) developed by Google. That brings Google’s on-device machine learning.</p><p id="d867">All the APIs of ML-Kit run’s on-device allowing real-time and offline capabilities. This also means that the functionality is also available in offline mode.</p><p id="a9f5">To use the Standalone ML-Kit on-device SDK, we don’t need to create a project on firebase and <code>google.json</code> file.</p><p id="d40e">If you are using firebase machine learning then you can check this <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>, how you can migrate.</p><blockquote><p id="aecc">Note: Currently this is a beta release of ML Kit. This API might be changed in backward-incompatible.</p></blockquote></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="41ca">In this article, we’re going to build an Android app that uses ML Kit’s Language Identification on-device API to identify input text and classify its language name with respect to the language code (en, ar, hi, etc).</p><p id="4278">For the purposes of this demo project, I’ve just implemented only 3 languages here:</p><ul><li id="b1c1">English (en)</li><li id="89bb">Hindi (hi)</li><li id="9282">Arabic (ar)</li></ul><p id="470f">ML-Kit recognizes the text in more than 100 languages in the both native and romanized script, like Chinese, Russian, Hindi, English, Greek. Here’s the <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/identification/langid-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete list of supported languages</a>.</p><p id="d2e4">By the end of this tutorial, you should see something similar to the screenshot below:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/786/1*RXD7K0Zt3W7n3DafMCRivQ.png" width="393" height="512" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*RXD7K0Zt3W7n3DafMCRivQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/786/1*RXD7K0Zt3W7n3DafMCRivQ.png 393w" sizes="393px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/46/1*RXD7K0Zt3W7n3DafMCRivQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Screenshot language Identify</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="9829">First things first, we need to add a <code>mlkit:language-id</code> dependency on our Android project in the <code>app/build.gradle</code> file.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to continue exploration of <strong>compressing whole PBR texture sets</strong> together (as opposed to compressing each texture from the set separately) and using the fact that those textures are <strong>strongly correlated</strong>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/05/21/dimensionality-reduction-for-image-and-texture-set-compression/">my previous post</a>, I have described how we can “decorrelate” some of the channels using PCA/SVD and how many of the dimensions in such a decorrelated space contain small amount of information, and therefore can be either dropped completely, stored at a lower resolution, or quantized aggressively. This idea is a backbone of almost all successful image compression algorithms – from JPEG to BC/DXT.</p>



<p>This time we will look at exploring some <strong>redundancy across both the stored dimensions, as well as the image space </strong>using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_approximation">sparse methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-SVD">kSVD algorithm</a> (<a href="https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs278/papers/ksvd.pdf">original paper link</a>).</p>



<p>From my personal motivation, I wanted to learn more about those sparse methods, play with implementing them and build some intuition – one of my coworkers and collaborators on my previous team at Google, <a href="https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il/">Michael Elad</a> is one of the key researchers in the field and his presentations inspired and interested me a lot – and as I believe that until you can implement and explain something yourself, you don’t really understand it – I wanted to explore this fascinating field (in a basic, limited form) myself.</p>



<p>First I am going to do present a simplified and intuitive explanation of what “<strong>sparsity</strong>” and “<strong>overcompletness</strong>” mean and how their redundancy can be an advantage. Then I will describe how we can use sparse approximation methods for tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and texture compression. Then I will provide a quick explanation of k-SVD algorithm steps and how it works, and finally show some results / evaluation for the task of <strong>compressing PBR material texture sets</strong>. </p>



<p>This post will come with <strong>a colab notebook</strong> (soon – I need to clean it up slightly) so you can reproduce all the code and explore those methods yourself.</p>



<h3>Sparse and dictionary based methods in real-time rendering?</h3>



<p>I tried to look for some other references to dictionary based methods in real time rendering and was able to find only of three resources: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ManchorKo/gdc2013-ompandksvd">a presentation by Manny Ko and Robin Green about kSVD and OMP</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ManchorKo/dictionary-learningingames-kodraft7gdc14mathforgames">a presentation by Manny Ko about Dictionary Learning in Games</a>, and a mention of using <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19EHLJAfqQECjRRShHyS3mHrg4XFxpCOx/view">Vector Quantization for shadow mask compression by Bo Li</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_quantization">VQ is a method</a> that is more similar to palletizing than full dictionary learning, but still a part of the family of sparse methods. I recommend those presentations, (a lot of what I describe about the theoretical part – and how I describe – overlaps with them) and if you are aware of any more mentions of those IMO underutilized methods in such a context, please leave a comment and I’ll be happy to link. </p>



<h2>Vector storage – complete and orthogonal basis, vs overcomplete and sparsely used frames / dictionaries</h2>



<p>To explain what are sparse methods, let’s start with a simple, 2 dimensional vector. How can we represent such a vector? “This is obvious, we can just use 2 numbers, x and y!”. Sure, but what do those numbers mean? They correspond to an <strong>orthonormal vector basis</strong>. x and y represent actually a proportion of position along the x axis, and the y axis. If you have done computer graphics, you know that you can easily change your basis. For example, a vector can be decribed in so called “world space” (with arbitrary, fixed point), “camera / view space”, or for some simple video game AI  purpose in space of a computer-controlled character.</p>

<p>Vector basis might have different properties. Two that are very desired are orthogonality and normality, often combined together as <strong>orthonormal basis</strong>. Orthonormality gives us trivial way of changing information between two basis back and forth (no matrix inversion required, no scaling/non-unity Jacobians introduced) and some other properties related to closed form products and integrals – it’s beyond scope of this post, but I recommend <a href="https://www.ppsloan.org/publications/StupidSH36.pdf">“Stupid Spherical Harmonics Tricks”</a> from Peter-Pike Sloan for some examples how SH being orthonormal makes it a desired basis for storing spherical signals. </p>



<p>Choice of “the best” basis matters a lot when doing compression – I have described it in <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/05/21/dimensionality-reduction-for-image-and-texture-set-compression/">my previous blog</a>, but as a quick refresher, “decorrelating” dimensions can give us basis in which information is maximized in each sequential subset of dimensions – meaning that the first dimension has the most information and variability present, the next one the same or smaller amount etc. This is limited to linear relationships and covariance, but lots of real data shows linear redundancy.</p>

<p>One of the requirements of a space to be a basis is <strong>completeness</strong> and <strong>uniqueness</strong> of representation. Uniqueness of the representation means that given a fixed basis, there is only a single way to describe a vector in this space. <strong>Completeness </strong>means that every vector can be represented without loss of information. In my last post, we looked at the <strong>truncated SVD – which is not complete</strong>, because we lose some original information and there is no way how we can represent it back.</p>



<p>What is quite interesting is that we can go further than vector basis and go towards <strong>overcomplete frames</strong> (let’s simplify – a lot – for the purpose of this post and say that frame is just “some generalization” of a basis). This means that we have more vectors in space than the “rank” of the information we want to store. Overcomplete frames can’t be orthogonal or unique (I encourage readers for whom this is a new concept to try to prove it – even if just intuitively). Sounds pretty useless for information compression? Not really, let me give here a visual example:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3998" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/image-2-6/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png" data-orig-size="834,409" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=640" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=834" alt="" width="454" height="221" srcset="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=451 451w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px"><figcaption>Example of a set of points/vectors that cannot be represented well by any two orthogonal vectors, but on the other hand three frame vectors describe this set pretty well.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that while in the case of overcomplete frame every point can be described in infinitely many ways (just like x + y = 5 has infinitely many solutions of x and y values that satisfy it), we usually are going to look for a <strong>sparse representation</strong>. We want as many of the components to be zero (or close to zero enough so that we can discard them, accepting some errors), and the input vectors described by a linear combination of less frame vectors than the size of the original basis. </p>



<p>If this description seems vague, looking at the above example – with complete basis, we generally need two numbers to describe the input point set. However, with an overcomplete frame, we can use just a single 2-bit basis index and a float value describing magnitude along it:</p>

<p>Yes, we lose some information, and there is an approximation error – but there is always an error in the case of lossy compression – and the error in such a basis is way smaller than from any truncated SVD (keeping a single dimension of orthogonal basis).</p>



<p>Terminology wise – we commonly refer to a frame vector as <strong>atom</strong>, and collection of atoms as <strong>dictionary</strong> – and I will use atoms and dictionary mostly throughout this post.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="4012" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/image-9-3/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png" data-orig-size="951,407" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-9" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=640" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=951" alt="" srcset="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png 951w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=150 150w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=300 300w, https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-9.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px"><figcaption>Dense vs sparse representation – a dense representation has a minimal number of dimensions (rank) of the set, but every item represented in it is going to be represented by multiple coefficients. With sparse representation, we might have many more dimensions, but every item is going to be represented by a small subset of those – most coefficients are zero.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Also note – we will come back to this later in the next section – I have used here a 2D example and a 1-sparse representation (single atom to represent input) – but with higher dimensions, we can (and in practice do) <strong>use multiple atoms per vector</strong> – so if you have 16 atoms, any representation that uses 1-15 of them can be considered sparse. Obviously if the input space is 3D, and your dictionary has 20 atoms, while a 10 atom representation of a vector “could” be seen as sparse, it probably won’t make sense for most practical scenarios.</p>



<h2>Sparsity and images – palettes and tiles</h2>



<p>Now I admit, this 2D case is not super compelling. However, things start to look much more interesting in some much higher dimensions. Imagine that instead of storing 20 numbers for a 20 dimensional vector, you could store just a few indices and a few numbers – in very high dimensions, sparse representations get more and more interesting. Before going towards high dimensional case, let me just show some interesting connection – what happens if for a single pixel of e.g. RGB image we store only index (not even a weight) from a dictionary? Then we end up with an <strong>image palette</strong>.</p>

<p>Image palettization is an example of a sparse representation method! One of many algorithms to compute image palette it is k-means, which is a more basic version of k-SVD that I’m going to describe later.</p>



<p>Palettization generalizes to many dimensions – if you have a PBR texture set with 20 channels, you can still palettize it – just your entries will be 20 dimensional vectors. </p>



<p>However, we can go much further and increase the dimensionality (hoping for <strong>more redundancy in more dimensions</strong>) much further. Let’s have a look at this Kodak dataset image and at <strong>image tiles</strong>:</p>

<p>There is lots of self-similarity in this image – not just within pixel values (those would palettize very well), but among whole image patches! In such a scenario, we can take a whole patch to become our input vector. I have mentioned in the past that thinking beyond “image is 2D matrix / 3D tensor” is one …</p></div></div>

                    <p>A few years ago we started our own VR product for Location-Based Entertainment (LBE). But we were not a game studio - there were no staff game designers, artists or modellers. We didnâ€™t have a multi million budget to create a full featured game studio. However, we were a team of experienced software engineers with a goal to create a quality VR product that would excite our clients and us.</p>
<p>The early successful VR LBE products were based on modern 6DOF (6 degrees of freedom) VR technologies and exploited the fact that clients had only tried low quality 3DOF cardboard VR or other outdated VR arcades (or had not even tried VR at all). That means, frankly, it was easy to impress people when they started playing your game, but harder to advertise and actually persuade them to try. There was also a requirement to make the VR experience short - no longer than 30 minutes. The VR hardware (especially computer backpack) were too heavy for those who tried VR for the first time. </p>
<p>These two points (easy to impress and a short session length) helped decrease the cost of developing a quality VR LBE product. You didnâ€™t have to be a full featured game studio and create a long and complex game to create a great experience. We think that VR LBE still preserves the same traits today.</p>
<p>We have experience developing both types of VR LBE products - full-immersion games and active e-sport games. Each type has its own challenges and set of expectations, but there are of course some common difficulties, especially for a less experienced and not fully featured game studio. We will discuss them below.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/poster1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>In full-immersion games itâ€™s important to create a rich atmosphere by using photo-realistic visuals, quality audio effects, and haptic feedback. Ideally, such content should be developed in house and will require artists and modellers to create high quality assets. But we chose to focus on the software and effects part to explore the modern VR potential. Most 3D models we purchased from the Unity Assets Store and only hired freelancers to work on specific parts. It put the quality of the final product at risk, but was far cheaper and faster than starting from the ground up.</p>
<p>One of the main aspects of immersion are high-quality models. Players must be able to look at objects such as guns, interior parts, surfaces and NPCs at very close range - literally right before their eyes. That means that models should have enough polygons and use PBR (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering">Physically based rendering</a>). Full-immersion games require powerful computers or non-trivial optimization techniques and huge development efforts for a mobile VR platform like Oculus Quest.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1598256667761-2.jpg" alt=""></p><p>In active e-sport games players move quickly and interact with each other and the game environment at a very high speed. The goal is to get the highest score and stay ahead of your competitors. This fact lowers the 3D models requirements - they donâ€™t have to look very real, you can even get away with using low-poly models for some content.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s much more important to tune the game balance, dynamics and play area geometry. But it doesnâ€™t mean you can just throw a bunch of primitives on the Scene and ignore creating 3D models and paying artists - a smaller level of detail doesnâ€™t entail lower quality. Due to budget limitations, we didnâ€™t hire staff modellers and instead bought 3D models from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5217">Synty Studios</a>. We think they produce the best low-poly models that can be used even with low-power mobile VR hardware like Oculus Quest without significant optimization efforts. Of course, if the performance cost was lower, we would prefer to use high quality photo-realistic assets for e-sports as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you buy 3D models in a public store like Unity Assets Store, you run the risk of finding the same assets in a competing product, especially if you use something unique, like Synty Studios assets. However, we think itâ€™s less of an issue in VR LBE games than in PC and console games - VR LBE and the general gaming market have different target audiences. The main problem is that in VR we can use only a small subset of the vast model selection of public stores. Is there a way to solve this without hiring 3D artists and modellers? Letâ€™s figure it out.</p>
<h2>A Dream</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s imagine you are walking in some atmospheric place and suddenly come up with an idea for a VR quest that will be based on the location youâ€™re in.
<img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1598256744121-3.jpg" alt="">
You capture the location in a video using your smartphone. At home you open the editor of your choice and import the video from the cloud. In a few minutes you have a ready to use 3D scene, perfectly capturing the location you were in.</p>
<p>Then, you select the half-rotten couch and rotate it up-right - an NPC will wait for the players here. You noticed there are cranes demolishing another building in the distance. You decide they should be a bit closer, so you select and move them. All crane movements have been captured as well.</p>
<p>You launch the demo using your mobile VR device. Here you can move around freely and plan future quest scenarios.</p>
<p>Is this achievable today? Obviously not, but we think the technology is getting there - itâ€™s already possible to scan individual objects, buildings, streets and even whole cities. After some processing, the scanned objects can be used by modern 3D games, VR, 3D printing devices and in other technical applications. Real time 3D scanning is used by self-driving cars and robots. Most AAA projects use scanned assets to achieve excellent graphics quality and reduce model creation time. But the scanned models still have to be processed by modellers.</p>
<p>Can we potentially do away with manual modelling? Probably not, even if the scanning technology starts working perfectly - itâ€™s impossible to scan something which only exists in your imagination. Pure 3D scanning is useless for Sci-Fi and fantasy projects and objects that donâ€™t have real world references. But someday we might have GANs (generative adversarial networks) which can generate 3D models and even full scenes just based on sketches.</p>
<p>This article is the first in a series that will try to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to get a virtual model of the real object or scene? Is it possible to use only a smartphone?</li>
<li>How to use the captured model after the scan? Is it possible to use it on mobile hardware?</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to scan reality</h2>
<p>Today there are several ways to scan real world objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary 2D photos (photogrammetry).</li>
<li>Structured light solutions.</li>
<li>Time-of-Flight cameras and lasers.</li>
<li>Light field cameras.</li>
</ul>
<p>These approaches will be further discussed in the series, with each article focusing on a single approach. The next article discussing photogrammetry is available here - <a href="https://exyte.com/a-scanning-dream-using-a-camera">â€œA Scanning Dream: using a cameraâ€�</a>.</p>

    <p>My feeble attempt at a non-too-technical, mostly FUD- and hyperbole-free
FAQ about WebAssembly.</p>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-cpu-machine-code">Is WebAssembly CPU machine code?</h4>

<p>No, WebAssembly is an intermediate format more akin to
.NET or Java bytecode than machine code. If you don’t like
the .NET or Java association, just think of it as an instruction
set of a ‘fantasy CPU’.</p>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-assembly-code">Is WebAssembly assembly code?</h4>

<p>No, ‘assembly code’ usually means the text representation of a specific
CPU instruction set. WebAssembly in its typical form is neither a text
representation nor is it CPU-specific (the WASM spec <em>does</em> define a text
representation though, which is basically WebAssembly-assembly).</p>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-java-appletsactivexplugins-20">Is WebAssembly “Java Applets/ActiveX/Plugins 2.0”?</h4>

<p>No:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is different from <strong>Java Applets</strong> because it reuses the
existing Javascript VM that already exists in browsers instead
of adding another big VM which would have to be security-hardened. WebAssembly
also doesn’t allow to call out into native code like Java Applets did via JNI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ActiveX and browser plugins</strong> were native machine code DLLs where the security was
built on trusting a 3rd-party and wishful thinking. With WebAssembly
the trust rests solely on the browser maker and his ability to secure the
browser sandbox.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="is-webassembly-a-security-risk">Is WebAssembly a security risk?</h4>

<p>No, unless you consider Javascript a security risk. WebAssembly is about as
secure as Javascript since it runs in the same sandbox. Typical WebAssembly
implementations only add a fairly small parser module to the existing JS
engine. For instance in <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit">WebKit</a>, WebAssembly seems to
account for about 10k out of 432k lines of code for the whole JavaScriptCore
engine. So only about 2% of the whole Javascript engine are a new 
WebAssembly-specific attack surface.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-access-sockets-files-native-api-x-from-webassembly">Can I access sockets, files, native API X… from WebAssembly?</h4>

<p>No, WebAssembly runs inside the browser sandbox and can only access Web
APIs (just like Javascript). However, the emscripten SDK provides wrappers
for many common native APIs which simplifies porting existing C/C++ code
over (for instance sockets-to-WebSockets, GL-to-WebGL, OpenAL-to-WebAudio,
and some more…).</p>

<h4 id="can-i-load-and-call-into-a-dll-from-webassembly">Can I load and call into a DLL from WebAssembly?</h4>

<p>No, DLLs are native machine code and thus off-limits.</p>

<p>Slightly related: WebAssembly supports <em>dynamic linking</em> between WASM modules,
this allows to reuse shared code modules (the idea is to reduce download size
by moving shared code into a separate module which can be cached locally).</p>

<h4 id="can-i-start-a-program-or-process-from-webassembly">Can I start a program or process from WebAssembly?</h4>

<p>Nope, same reason as DLLs, it would be unsafe.</p>

<h4 id="can-webassembly-be-used-to-circumvent-adblockers">Can WebAssembly be used to circumvent adblockers?</h4>

<p>No, it can only do things that Javascript can do. Even if the ad doesn’t
download images but renders its content ‘procedurally’ through
WebAssembly code, the actual WebAssembly module must have been downloaded
from some URL first (usually an ad-network server) and this can be
intercepted and blocked by adblockers just like regular ads.</p>

<h4 id="but-what-about-show-source">…but what about ‘Show Source’?!</h4>

<p>Come on now… that train had already left since people started using
Javascript minifiers and obfuscators. Just print a link to the github repo on
the JS console.</p>

<h4 id="as-a-frontend-developer-do-i-need-to-learn-cc-now">As a frontend developer, do I need to learn C/C++ now?</h4>

<p>No. One interesting use-case for WebAssembly is to create libraries that are
callable from Javascript. Computation-heavy code (for instance image
manipulation, physics engines, or whole game engines) could be implemented
as WebAssembly modules, but offer a Javascript API. <em>Using</em> such WebAssembly
module wouldn’t be much different from using a Javascript framework.</p>

<h4 id="can-webassembly-manipulate-the-dom">Can WebAssembly manipulate the DOM?</h4>

<p>For some reason this question seems to pop up most frequently :) The
answer is both no and yes. It cannot <em>directly</em> access the DOM, but it can
call out into Javascript, and JS can then work on the DOM. In emscripten this
is as simple as directly inlining Javascript code into C++ code. But jumping
back and forth between WebAssembly and Javascript isn’t fast (but it isn’t
terribly slow either, as demonstrated by emscripten’s GL-to-WebGL wrapper).
It’s perfectly possible to create a “dom.h” C or C++ library to do typical
“frontend programming” via WebAssembly, but this doesn’t make sense if the
motivation is performance, and C/C++ is probably not the nicest language for
this. DOM manipulation might make more sense with other languages that are
meant as a Javascript replacement.</p>

<h4 id="isnt-webassembly-useless-for-garbage-collected-languages">Isn’t WebAssembly useless for garbage collected languages?</h4>

<p>YES AND THANK THE GODS FOR THAT! Erm, actually no, scratch that :)</p>

<p>It is true that WebAssembly doesn’t have garbage collection support, but this
doesn’t mean that a WebAssembly module cannot implement its own garbage
collector. Look at <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/07/09/il2cpp-internals-garbage-collector-integration/">Unity3D’s
IL2CPP</a>, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/04/kotlinnative-tech-preview-kotlin-without-a-vm/">Kotlin
Native</a>,
or clang’s <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">Automatic Reference
Counting</a> for
examples of garbage-collected languages that don’t need a garbage-collected VM to work.
There is some info about potential GC support in a future WebAssembly version <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/GC.md">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="but-webassembly-programs-are-too-big">But WebAssembly programs are too big!</h4>

<p>This is not the fault of WebAssembly itself, which is a very compact byte code
format, but usually is a problem of the code base that’s been compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why WebAssembly modules can become bloated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Language runtimes</strong>: Most languages need some sort of runtime library to be
useful. In C this includes functions like printf, strcmp, fopen, … in C++
the std library classes can be considered the runtime even though most std
library code is in inline methods. Higher level languages like C# have a much
‘richer’ runtime, this is good for programmer productivity, but terrible for
code size.</li>
  <li><strong>Huge ‘Modulith’ Projects</strong>: Large C++ projects like AAA game engines or big
UI frameworks are easily multi-million-line code bases, and also often
heavily use OOP features like dynamic dispatch (virtual methods). Such code
bases make it very hard for the compiler’s dead code elimination to do its
thing.</li>
  <li><strong>3rd-party-dependencies</strong>: Many libraries and (for instance) game
development middleware haven’t been designed with binary size in mind, and
adding such dependencies carelessly can quickly grow out of control.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the ‘native world’ executable sizes of several dozen megabytes are not
uncommon these days, but on the web this is simply not acceptable. The TL;DR
is to use a more ‘embedded-programming’ philosophy when writing code for
WebAssembly (also here’s one of my older blog posts about the topic: 
<a href="http://floooh.github.io/2016/08/27/asmjs-diet.html">10 simple diet tricks for asm.js</a>).</p>

<p>WebAssembly programs <em>can</em> be small, but it takes effort. Hopefully now that
‘executable size’ is important again, we will also see more developers focus on this. Maybe
somebody comes up with a smallest-possible C runtime (I’m sure there’s still
room for improvements if seldom-used features are removed).</p>

<h4 id="if-webassembly-is-running-in-the-js-engine-how-can-it-be-fast">If WebAssembly is running in the JS engine, how can it be fast?</h4>

<p>…mainly for the same reasons that asm.js is faster than ‘idiomatic’ Javascript:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No garbage collection</strong>: both asm.js and WASM do not produce ‘garbage’ 
that needs to be collected, thus the JS garbage collector doesn’t kick in while
asm.js or WASM is running.
The only exception is when calling out into Javascript to talk to web APIs,
the JS shim usually needs to create temporary JS objects, and this produces 
garbage. New web APIs often make it a point to
offer ‘garbage free’ functions, which will help a lot when being called
from asm.js or WebAssembly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Everything is static</strong>: Javascript is an extremely dynamic language, which requires a
lot of effort to make it run fast since the JS engine needs to track type
changes and may decide to re-compile and re-optimize functions during runtime.
For highly dynamic code this burns a lot of CPU cycles and makes performance
behaviour unpredictable. WASM and asm.js both got rid of all this ‘dynamicism’. 
Once the code is compiled, it is guaranteed to stay that way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A linear memory model</strong>: This is probably the biggest difference to most
‘managed VMs’, and the most important factor for performance. High level
languages like Javascript, C# or Java treat memory as an idealized,
infinitely fast and infinitely big resource which the programmer shouldn’t
have to think about. Unfortunately the real world is a bit more complicated,
for instance there are little annoying details like cache-misses. In short,
having full control over the exact layout of data in memory is essential for
good performance. System programming languages like C, C++ and Rust allow
this fine level of control, and one of the most ingenious features of
emscripten (even before asm.js) was that it moved this ‘linear memory model’
into the Javascript environment by putting the C heap into a single Javascript 
TypedArray. This way the memory layout defined by the original C/C++ source code
is preserved, and the advantages of arranging
data in a cache-friendly way carry over.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s about all the FAQ-worthy questions I can think of for now. Until next time :)</p>

My workflow has changed substantially over the last several years. I thought I'd share what I'm currently doing.</p>
<p>Some criticize my workflow for its complexity, but I can assure you that it is amazingly functional once set up. I can't imagine working any other way.</p>
<p>I'll start with the "meta" <strong>infrastructure programs</strong> that make the whole workflow run, including the set-up. I'll then cover how I <strong>collect information</strong>. After that, I'll write about how I <strong>read and synthesize</strong> the information to help with sense-making. Then, I'll go over <strong>extracting information</strong>. Finally, I'll take you through <strong>the writing process</strong>, from concept to manuscript/grant submission. I've included links to past articles to show how I've set up my infrastructure.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>
<p><em>Hazel</em> recognizes any manuscripts saved to my Downloads Folder. Once matched, Hazel sends the file to Bookends.</p>
</div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_18772"><div><p><em>Hazel</em> monitors folders on my computer and acts on individual files according to rules I create. <em>Hazel</em> can even peek at the content of files and "recognize" what's inside. I have Hazel monitoring about a dozen folders on my Mac, but my Downloads Folder keeps <em>Hazel</em> the busiest. I have about two dozen rules running on my Downloads Folder alone. For this particular writing workflow, I ask Hazel to look at the contents of every PDF in my Downloads Folder and match files that have words unique to scholarly publications. I've found matching the matching criteria works the best. (I now use DOI instead of the term References, avoiding the import of annoying things, like CVs, into my Bookends database).</p>
<p><em>Bookends</em> syncs via iCloud (Mac and iOS).</p>
<p><em>Devonthink</em> indexes (not imports) multiple folders including: </p>
<ol>
<li>the PDF folder generated by Bookends in iCloud,</li>
<li>The Archive Folder in Dropbox, and</li>
<li>my Annotations Folder in Dropbox.</li>
</ol>
<p>My <em>Devonthink</em> database is synchronized via Dropbox to <em>Devonthink To Go</em>.</p>
<h3 id="collecting-information">Collecting information</h3>
<p>I collect information using <em>QxMD Read</em>, <em>Twitter</em>, or <em>Devonthink RSS</em> to find new literature. Less commonly, I conduct formal searches in PubMed or Google Scholar on the web or through <em>Bookends</em>. Other times I use <em>Launchbar</em> or <em>Highlights</em> to download literature I've found in the Bibliography of a manuscript.</p>
<p>Once I've found the information I'd like to read, I attempt to download the PDF. In iOS, If the PDF is available, I open the PDF with <em>Bookends</em>. Opening the PDF in <em>Bookends</em> imports the reference and PDF into the Bookend database and grabs the metadata. </p>
<p>If I'm on my Mac, I download the paper to my Downloads Folder. A Hazel script automatically launches Bookends and imports the manuscript into Bookends. </p>
<p>If the PDF isn't immediately available—I capture the reference to <em>OmniFocus</em> until I'm at work or when I sign on to work's VPN.</p>
<h3 id="reading-and-synthesizing">Reading and Synthesizing</h3>
<p>I read manuscripts almost exclusively in the <em>Highlights app</em> on my Mac or iPad. As I'm going, I highlight and make comments on the annotations. I read the entire paper through to the end, highlighting and commenting as I go. If I want to retain a significant point of an article, I make a Zettel (using my Zettel Template in <em>The Archive</em> on my Mac, or <em>Drafts</em> on iOS).</p>

<p><strong>My extraction process has changed significantly since 2015.</strong> I highlight the manuscript using <em>Highlights App</em> (either on my Mac or my iPad). After I annotate the paper, I'm ready to process it to make the information accessible to my writing system. I make sure my Bookends Library is synchronized and then work from my Mac. </p>
<p><strong>I no longer extract my annotations as individual files</strong> (this was far too labor-intensive and messed with the accuracy of Devonthink's AI). Instead, when I'm at my Mac, I open the paper from <em>Bookends</em> using <em>Highlights</em>. I make sure the metadata has been captured in Highlights (this ensures the proper information link back to <em>Bookends</em>). Then, <strong>I export all my annotations and comments as a single HTML file saved to an Annotations Folder in Dropbox.</strong> Finally, I index (not import) the Annotations Folder on Dropbox into Devonthink. This new workflow works much more reliably with <em>Devonthink's</em> AI.</p>
<p>Why HTML? Honestly, I'd prefer to use the Textbundle format, but Devonthink To Go is not able to recognize Textbundles. I like HTML documents because they include figures. Later, if I want, I can convert the extracted annotations into a PDF, but thus far, the Webarchive HTML files work well. </p>
<p>My Devonthink Writing Database has multiple indexed folders, including The Archive, PDFs from Bookends, and my extracted HTML Annotations. I have my <a href="https://wippp.com/home/keeping-current-with-devonthink-and-rss-feeds">RSS feeds of scientific literature</a> in a separate database. <strong>Devonthink's AI finds recently published papers related to documents in my library.</strong></p>
</div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_26641"><div><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><h4 id="blog-and-short-document-writing-ulysses-and-bear">Blog and Short Document Writing - Ulysses and Bear</h4><p>For creative writing, I now use <em>Bear</em>. I love Bear's writing environment (I think it improves my creativity) and use it for personal stories and songwriting. Blog entries, I write in <em>Ulysses</em>. Ulysses and Bear's multi-platform support and seamless synchronization are priceless for writing. Because I'm a bit fearful of proprietary formats, I am diligent about backing up my work. I use an <em>Omnifocus</em> reminder to backup both my Bear and in Ulysses database every week. </p><h4 id="manuscripts-grants-and-books-scrivener">Manuscripts, Grants, and Books - Scrivener</h4><p>For longer writing projects, nothing compares to <em>Scrivener</em>. <em>Scrivener</em> is a complete writing studio. I use the software regularly. I often use <em>Scapple</em> (created by the same developers as <em>Scrivener</em>) to plan the manuscript at a high level. To build my Scapple outline, I brainstorm ideas (including many trips to Devonthink). I prefer Scapple over other mind mapping software as it is less constrained on parent-children relationships. </p><p>Although I capture information differently from 2015, my use of Devonthink for finding information remains relatively unchanged. See the following entries:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://wippp.com/home/automating-the-organization-and-accessibility-of-academic-literature-bookends-and-devonthink-pro">Automating The Organization And Accessibility Of Academic Literature: Bookends And Devonthink Pro</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wippp.com/home/keeping-current-with-devonthink-and-rss-feeds">Unlock The Power Of RSS Feeds With Devonthink</a></li>
</ul><p>I can brainstorm and then move ideas around. I no longer use <em>Tinderbox</em>. Although very powerful, I spent far too much time trying to master simple tasks in Tinderbox rather than getting work done. Maybe I'll pick it up again in the future.</p><p>Once I've outlined my paper in <em>Scapple</em>, I export the <em>Scapple</em> file to OPML. If the outline is ready to start writing, I import the OPML file directly into <em>Scrivener</em>. If I want to tweak the outline more or add additional information, I open the OPML document in OmniOutliner. </p><p>Once my outline is in <em>Scrivener</em>, I start writing. The modern version of <em>Scrivener</em> synchronizes between all my devices, Mac and iOS. When I need to find a concept or citation, I turn to Devonthink either on my Mac (usually) or iOS (in a pinch). When I find something I want to use in my writing, I click the link at the top of the page on the HTML document. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_32992"><p>Clicking the link takes me to the corresponding reference in Bookends. I find the text from the annotations in the Bookends and copy the note (or notes) by right-clicking. </p></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596762548609_39660"><div><p>I then paste the note under the appropriate heading in Scrivener (or in Scapple or OmniOutliner if I'm still organizing). The single annotation is copied from Bookends along with the coded citation that will help Bookends compile my Bibliography.</p>
<p>Once I've pasted the note in Scrivener, I change the text color to blue. That way, I know what words I copied verbatim. I use Scrivener to track the state of various parts of the project. I use the interplay of Scrivener and Bookends to cite references as I'm writing. Different sections of my project go through multiple drafts—Scrivener tracks the phase of each component.</p>
<p>When the project is nearing completion, I export the project to Microsoft Word. There, I put the final touches on the manuscript. I then use the Speech function of my Mac to read each paragraph of the document back to me. I'm always amazed at how many errors I catch in this last phase of writing. Finally, I format the paper and Bibliography with Bookends. At this point, the information is ready to submit.</p>
<p>This is an overview of my current writing workflow. I’m curious to see what others are doing and/or how you riff/build on my workflow.</p>
<p>Until next time……</p>

<p><span>Abstract</span></p>
<p>
Physics-based rendering algorithms generate photorealistic images by simulating the flow of light through a detailed mathematical representation of a virtual scene. In contrast, <b>physics-based differentiable rendering</b> algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods
</p>
<p>
Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Challenges.</b></u> Compared to its "ordinary" counterpart, physics-based differentiable rendering introduces unique theoretical and practical challenges. For instance, practical problems can involve many (e.g., 10<sup>6</sup>--10<sup>10</sup>) parameters, making simple techniques for differentiation such as finite differences impractical. More advanced tools for automatic differentiation (e.g., <tt>PyTorch</tt> or <tt>Tensorflow</tt>) record a graph of intermediate computation steps that tends to become prohibitively large. Lastly, geometric derivatives involve a unique challenge: boundaries of objects introduce troublesome discontinuities during the computation of shadows and interreflections that lead to incorrect gradients if precautions are not taken. Thankfully, recent advances in physics-based differentiable rendering theory have enabled the differentiation of radiometric measurements with respect to arbitrary scene parameters as well as unbiased Monte Carlo estimators. <b>In this course, we provide an in-depth introduction to general-purpose physics-based differentiable rendering.</b>

        <p>Newsletters are a great way to find content, but the more you subscribe to, the worst your reading experience becomes. Email apps aren’t tailored for reading a ton of newsletters and finding what you want to read soon becomes a hassle. A few apps have begun tackling this problem with their own unique approaches to newsletter consumption. If your inbox is becoming overwhelmed, now might be the time to give one of these a try.</p>
<h2 id="Stoop-Inbox"><a href="#Stoop-Inbox" title="Stoop Inbox"></a><a href="https://stoopinbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stoop Inbox</a></h2><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hotlinks-f6004.appspot.com/blog/blog_stoop.jpg" alt="Stoop Inbox" title="Stoop Inbox"><br>Stoop gives you a new email address to subscribe to your favourite newsletters. Once you subscribe with that address, those newsletters will show up within the app and be nealty organised for a better reading experience. It frees your email inbox from the flood of newsletters and it makes it easier to read those you want to on your own time.</p>
<h2 id="Newslettrs"><a href="#Newslettrs" title="Newslettrs"></a><a href="https://newslettrs.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newslettrs</a></h2><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hotlinks-f6004.appspot.com/blog/blog_newslettrs.jpg" alt="Newslettrs" title="Newslettrs"><br>Newslettrs works like Stoop but there’s only a website but it offers a clean reading user experience that’s easy to navigate and read.</p>
<h2 id="Kill-The-Newsletter"><a href="#Kill-The-Newsletter" title="Kill The Newsletter"></a><a href="https://www.kill-the-newsletter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kill The Newsletter</a></h2><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hotlinks-f6004.appspot.com/blog/blog_killthenewsletter.jpg" alt="Kill The Newsletter" title="Kill The Newsletter"><br>Kill The Newsletter is perfect if you already use an RSS reader like Feedly. You can create an inbox which gives you a unique email address. When you subscribe to newsletters with that address, every issue you receive will be published to a unique RSS feed. You can then add that RSS feed to your favorite reader and read your newsletters like any other news source.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><section><p>We live in a connected world.</p><p>We spend our days with various devices: Computers at work, phones and wearables on the go, smart speakers at home—our interactions with technology are spread across different touchpoints and interfaces.</p><p>The possibilities are endless. Yet, how we use technology often feels disconnected, even clunky.</p><p>Is this going to change? If yes, how and when?<br></p><h2 id="towards-a-multimodal-multi-device-future">Towards a Multimodal, Multi-Device Future</h2><p>At least since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo">Put That There</a>, many have seen multimodal user interfaces as the holy grail in human-computer interaction. Being able to use any modality (speech, touch, gestures, eye gaze) that best fits your current situation is seen as liberating and inclusive for a wide range of users.</p><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyBEUyEtxQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Of course, this has been greatly influenced by SciFi, too. When people envision future multimodal user experiences, examples like Minority Report often come to mind where people are standing in front of gigantic machines that support all kinds of input modalities at once. Is this practical today?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/tom-cruise-steven-spielberg-minority-report-BLVqLi1p4Pt7i">via GIPHY</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>3.5 years ago (shortly before <a href="https://www.jovo.tech/">Jovo</a> joined betaworks <a href="https://betaworks.com/voicecamp/">Voicecamp</a>), I published an article called <a href="https://www.context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen/">Alexa, Please Send This To My Screen</a> with some early thoughts on voice experience design. I came to the conclusion that most voice experiences need to be embedded into wider product ecosystems to become truly useful. To me, one of the biggest differences between SciFi and technology today is that our interactions are now spread across different devices. There is no more “one machine does everything.”</p><p>The new multimodal experience is not just one device that supports everything, it’s a product ecosystem that works across devices and contexts.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/08/multimodal-then-now.jpg"></figure><p>And it seems like things are progressing. When I published the article, smart speakers were mostly disconnected voice-only devices. Just a few months later, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/dp/B077SXWSRP">Echo Show</a> was introduced as the first Alexa smart display and Google Assistant became more deeply integrated into Android phones, allowing for some early continuous experiences like “send this to my phone.” I’m confident that it soon will be normal for any device to be shipped with a microphone.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/08/voice-then-now-soon.jpg"></figure><p>With all these new devices added to the product mix, it gets more and more complex to design, build, and improve connected experiences. Which devices and modalities should you build for? It’s easy to lose track of the user's needs with all these technological possibilities.<br></p><h2 id="context-first-a-term-and-publication">Context-First, a Term and Publication</h2><blockquote>“<em>The right information, at the right time, on the right device.</em>”</blockquote><p>The quote from above was adapted from Michal Levin’s great book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-multi-device-experiences/9781449340391/">Designing Multi-Device Experiences</a> that I read a few years ago. For us, this is what contextual experiences should be all about: delivering value on the best available device and modality.</p><p>At<a href="https://www.jovo.tech/"> Jovo</a>, we've been mentioning the term <em>Context-First</em> for a while, most prominently in our <a href="https://www.context-first.com/introducing-jovo-v3-the-voice-layer/">v3 launch announcement</a>. There is so much overlap between “voice” and “multimodal” experiences that it always felt weird to us to use terms like “voice-first.” With more devices being available, context plays an even more important role in product design decisions. It was important for us to find a term that reflects this.</p><p>We want to use this publication for documentation and open learning about building context-first products. When I started working on <a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig/status/993818598530527232">my masters’ thesis</a>, there was not a lot of actionable information available on multimodal user interfaces. It was either too concrete (focused on the “here”, e.g. simplistic tutorials) or too abstract (focused on the “there”, e.g. very visionary, futuristic essays). The industry still lacks content that focuses on the in-between (<a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig/status/1259830479517343744">here are some counter examples</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.jovo.tech/content/images/2020/08/actionable-middle.png"></figure><p>Here are some topics that we will likely cover:</p><ul><li>Challenges that need to be solved to get from “here” to “there”</li><li>Deep dives into different device types and modalities</li><li>Case studies and examples that focus on a specific vertical</li><li>Providing business context for the more <a href="https://www.jovo.tech/news">technical Jovo announcements</a><br></li></ul><p>What are you interested in?

Yet, there’s no denying that GitHub has become the <em>de facto</em> standard to host Open Source projects. With GitHub Actions, it’s now possible to implement entire Continuous Integration pipelines without leaving GitHub.</p> <p>In this post, I’d like to highlight how to release Maven <em>artifacts</em> using GitHub Actions.</p> <div> <h2 id="maven-prerequisites">Maven prerequisites</h2> <div> <p>Before creating the <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> pipeline - and running it, it’s necessary to configure the underlying Maven project.</p> <div> <h3 id="a-quick-maven-primer">A quick Maven primer</h3> <p>Maven is a large subject, that deserves more than this post can cover. But to understand the rest of this post, here are the most important parts.</p> <p>Maven references projects by a triplet of unique coordinates composed of:</p> <ol><li><span>A group ID</span></li><li><span>An artifact ID</span></li><li><span>A version</span></li></ol> <p>For example, the sample project’s coordinates are:</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;groupId&gt;</span>ch.frankel.blog.renamer<span>&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>renamer-swing<span>&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;version&gt;</span>1.0-SNAPSHOT<span>&lt;/version&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <p>The output of a project is an artifact <em>e.g.</em> a JAR.</p> <p>You can append the version of a project with <code>-SNAPSHOT</code>. A <em>snapshot</em> version is under development; a non-snapshot one, a regular release.</p> <p>Some projects provide milestones, and/or release candidates before the final release. In that case, Maven doesn’t natively offer a naming scheme for that. For example, the Spring framework append <code>.Mx</code>, <code>.RCx</code>, and <code>.RELEASE</code> to the version. they are <strong>not</strong> considered <em>snapshots</em>.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="release-management">Release management</h3> <p>The <a href="https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maven Release plugin</a> manages the release process. It provides two complementary goals, <code>prepare</code> and <code>perform</code>. They do the following:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Prepare</dt> <dd> <ol><li><span>Change the version in the <abbr title="Project Object Model" "="">POM</abbr> from <code>x-SNAPSHOT</code> to a new version</span></li><li><span>Transform the <abbr title="Source Control Management">SCM</abbr> information in the POM to include the final destination of the tag</span></li><li><span>Commit the modified POM</span></li><li><span>Tag the code in the SCM with a version name</span></li><li><span>Bump the version in the POM to a new value <code>y-SNAPSHOT</code></span></li><li><span>Commit the modified POM</span></li></ol> </dd> <dt>Perform</dt> <dd> <ol><li><span>Checkout from an SCM URL with optional tag</span></li><li><span>Run the predefined Maven <code>deploy</code> goal</span></li></ol> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>For the required SCM information, the Maven POM offers a dedicated section to configure it. With our sample, it looks like:</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;scm&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;developerConnection&gt;</span>scm:git:https://github.com/ajavageek/renamer-swing.git<span>&lt;/developerConnection&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/scm&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>The above snippet allows for different protocols: <code>git</code>, <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>ssh</code>, or even <code>file</code>. Authenticating with the <code>git</code> protocol requires a SSH key. In the context of a CI pipeline, this is not desirable.</p> <p>Thus, the above configuration snippet needs to use the <code>http</code> protocol. This requires credentials in the form of a user/password pair. Maven decouples project-specific data, from data shared across projects, such as security-related data. The POM is responsible for the former, while the <code>$HOME/.m2/settings.xml</code> file holds the latter.</p> <p>Each credentials pair requires a unique identifier.</p> <div> <p>~/.m2/settings.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;settings&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;servers&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;server&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;id&gt;</span>github<span>&lt;/id&gt;</span>                     <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
      <span>&lt;username&gt;</span>my_usernam<span>&lt;/username&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;password&gt;</span>my_password<span>&lt;/password&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/server&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/servers&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/settings&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div>  <p>To configure a Maven project to use a specific <code>server</code>, add a property with the <code>project.scm.id</code> key and the server’s <code>id</code> as the value.</p> <div> <p>pom.xml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;properties&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;project.scm.id&gt;</span>github<span>&lt;/project.scm.id&gt;</span>  <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>&lt;/properties&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td> <td>The project will use the <code>github</code> server configured un the settings file</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="distribution-management">Distribution management</h3> <p>Maven authors designed Maven around a plugin architecture. By itself, Maven just provides a build lifecycle, with a set of build phases. The Maven engine calls each phase in order; the cycle cannot advance to a later phase without having run through earlier phases. For example, phases in the build lifecycle include <code>compile</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>integration-test</code>, <code>package</code> and <code>deploy</code>. <code>test</code> cannot run without first running <code>compile</code>.</p> <p>You can bind plugin goals to a specific phase. By default, Maven binds a couple of goals. For example, the <code>package</code> phase binds the <code>maven-jar-plugin:jar</code> goal. Running <code>mvn package</code> will execute all goals bounds to all phases in order, up until <code>package</code>.</p> <p>Calling the <code>release:perform</code> goal launches a Maven fork that runs the <code>deploy</code> phase. By default, Maven binds the <code>deploy:deploy</code> goal of the Maven Deploy plugin to <code>deploy</code>. This implies Maven has run goals bound to the <code>package</code> phase <strong>before</strong>. For this reason, the build artifact is available when <code>deploy</code> starts. Deploying means that Maven will push the artifact to a <em>registry</em> that needs to be explicitly configured.</p> <p>In the context of this project, the artifact is a JAR, and the registry, GitHub. This translates into the following configuration snippet:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;distributionManagement&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;repository&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;id&gt;</span>github<span>&lt;/id&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;name&gt;</span>GitHub<span>&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://maven.pkg.github.com/ajavageek/renamer-swing<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>  <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
  <span>&lt;/repository&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/distributionManagement&gt;</span></code></pre> </div> </div>  </div> <div> <h3 id="the-maven-command">The Maven command</h3> <p>The build should execute both the <code>release:prepare</code> and <code>release:perform</code> goals.</p> <p>By default, <code>release:prepare</code> is interactive: the plugin asks for the release version, as well as for the new snapshot version. For an automated build, this is not possible.</p> <p>It’s possible to run Maven in batch mode by using the command-line <code>-B</code> flag. In that case, the plugin automatically infers both release and snapshot versions.</p> <p>The command becomes:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="bash">mvn <span>-B</span> release:prepare release:perform</code></pre> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="the-maven-wrapper">The Maven wrapper</h3> <p>The final preparation step is to become fully independent of the Maven version.</p> <p>In the future, the specific Maven version used to build the project might not be available anymore. Versions that are available at that time might not be compatible with it. For this reason, a Maven plugin provides a <em>wrapper</em>. A wrapper self-executable JAR that can kickstart a specific version of the <code>mvn</code> tool regardless of the environment. To create such a wrapper is straightforward:</p> <div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="bash">mvn <span>-N</span> io.takari:maven:wrapper</code></pre> </div> </div> <p>This creates a couple of files, including a <code>.mvn</code> folder, inside the project. You need to add all those files in the SCM.</p> <p>From this point on, instead of using the <code>mvn</code> command, you should use the <code>mvnw</code> script located at the root of the project. The build doesn’t require a local Maven installation anymore.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="building-on-github">Building on GitHub</h2> <div> <p>Now that we configured the POM, it’s time to integrate Maven in the GitHub build.</p> <p>The idea is to have two branches: <code>master</code> and <code>release</code>. Every time a commit happens on the <code>release</code> branch, GitHub should create a new release and a new deployment. At a later time, a manual step can then rebase/merge the <code>master</code> and <code>release</code> branches.</p> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Note"></i> </td> <td> <p>Alternative flow</p> <p>Remember that the <code>release:prepare</code> goal actually creates a tag. As an alternative, it’s possible to configure Maven to reverse the default flow, so that it triggers the build on a tag, and then pushes to a branch.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <div> <h3 id="github-actions-introduction">GitHub Actions introduction</h3> <p>Existing CI tools make use of a configuration file stored at the root of the repository:</p> <table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th>Tool</th> <th>&nbsp;File</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>Jenkins</p></td> <td><p><code>Jenkinsfile</code></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GitLab</p></td> <td><p><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Travis CI</p></td> <td><p><code>.travis.yml</code></p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>GitHub Actions follows a similar approach, with two important differences:</p> <ol><li><span>The project can make use of more than one build file - known as a <em>workflow</em></span></li><li><span>They must be located in a <code>$PROJECT_ROOT/.github/workflows</code> folder</span></li></ol> </div> <div> <h3 id="build-steps">Build steps</h3> <p>The first step is obviously to checkout the repo:</p>  <p>The next step is to install a JDK:</p> <div> <p>release.yml</p> <div> <pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Setup Java JDK</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>As a technical founder coming from engineering, I have this background process in my head that constantly thinks about how things will scale, even when talking product.</p>
<p>It's not easy to turn it off, unless you are aware of it.</p>
<p>In a way it's an asset, because it assesses in real time the difficulty of what you are discussing and can steer you in the right direction. </p>
<p>Most of the time though, if you are a product decision maker, it is severely limiting. Especially when having open-ended discussion in which you think broadly about a direction to take.</p>
<p>To fight this, I came up with this question that I answer completely disregarding technical details:</p>
<p><strong>How would you (re)build your product if storage, compute and scaling weren't a concern at all?</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>What basic assumptions would you change?</li>
<li>What feature would you add?</li>
<li>What would you allow your users to do?</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise is useful because we are trained to deeply consider technical concerns at all times. It's second nature. How would I implement this? Which data structure? Which algorithm? The DB schema? <em>This is bullshit.</em> </p>
<p>We are at a point where scalability is an implementation detail, not something that should cloud your judgement when thinking about product. It should have way less space in your head.</p>
<p>We have established technologies that make scaling someone else's problem for cheap (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, ...)</p>
<p>You can fix your scalability issues once you strike gold. Once your idea is its final PMF form. Avoid premature optimization until then. That's what I'll try to do.</p>
<p>Unlearning is part of becoming the best at what you do.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>

                    <div>
                        <p>Eloquent like many other ORMs have a nice feature that allows assigning properties to an object without having to assign each value individually, this is a nice feature that saves a lot of time and lines of code but can lead to a vulnerability if used incorrectly. </p>
<p>For example here is a simplified example of an insecure code that we found during a <a href="https://cyberpanda.la/#services">security code review</a> for one of our clients</p>
<pre><code>// app/Models/User.php file
class User extends Authenticatable {
 use SoftDeletes;
 const ROLE_USER          = 'user';
 const ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR = 'administrator';

 protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password', 'role'];

  // ... rest of the code ...
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// app/Http/Requests/StoreUserRequest.php file
class StoreUserRequest extends Request {
 public function rules() {
   return [
       'name'             =&gt; 'string|required',
       'email'            =&gt; 'email|required',
       'password'         =&gt; 'string|required|min:6',
       'confirm_password' =&gt; 'same:password',
   ];
 }
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>// app/Controllers/UserController.php file
class UserController extends Controller {
   public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {
       $user = new User();
       $user-&gt;role = User::ROLE_USER;
       $user-&gt;fill($request-&gt;all());
       $user-&gt;save();

       return response()-&gt;json([
         'success' =&gt; true,
       ],201);
   }

   // ... rest of the code ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The issue here is if a malicious attacker submits the payload below, he will be able to register an admin user with higher privileges and probably take over the admin panel of the application.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "name"             : "Hacker",
    "email"            : "hacker@example.com",
    "role"             : "administrator",
    "password"         : "some_random_password",
    "confirm_password" : "some_random_password"
} 
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you might wonder here why <code>role</code> is in the <code>$fillable</code> attribute, if the “role” wasn't there, there would not be a security issue. The reason that it was added there is that there was another API that would allow changing role too, this is a common pattern that we see in Laravel applications that we <a href="https://cyberpanda.la/#services">review or pen-test</a>, while <code>$fillable</code> is great if you have a simple application, it gets hard to manage when application growths and there are multiple APIs(or Roles) that are updating/creating a same type of model with different ACL roles.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities in Laravel applications.</p>
<h4>Prevention tips</h4>
<h5>1. Pass to model only fields that have been validated</h5>
<p>This is probably the most effective method of dealing with mass assignment attacks, instead of passing the full data from request, you can pass only fields that have been validated. In the above code example that will be name, email and password. To do so, Laravel provides you with a <code>$request-&gt;validated()</code> method, that returns you only fields that have been validated. So in the code above, replacing <code>$request-&gt;all()</code> with <code>$request-&gt;validated()</code> would fix the issue.</p>
<pre><code>public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {
   $user = new User();
   $user-&gt;role = User::ROLE_USER;
   $user-&gt;fill($request-&gt;validated());
   $user-&gt;save();

   return response()-&gt;json([
     'success' =&gt; true,
   ],201);
}</code></pre>
<p>If you are not using Laravel’s request validation, you can also use <code>$request-&gt;validate()</code> or <code>$validator-&gt;validated()</code> which also returns only data that has been validated.</p>
<h5>2. Use whitelisting instead of blacklisting</h5>
<p>We encourage using <code>$fillable</code>(which is whitelisting only columns that can be mass assigned) instead of <code>$guarded</code>(defines properties that can’t be mass assigned) because you may easily forget to add a new column to a <code>$guarded</code> array, leaving it open for mass assignment by default.</p>
<h5>3. Use $model-&gt;forceFill($data) method with caution</h5>
<p><code>forceFill</code> ignores all the config that is set in <code>$guarded</code> and <code>$fillable</code> properties and saves passed data as it is into the model. If you have to use <code>forceFill</code>, make sure passed data can not  be manipulated by the user.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n the late 2010s,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/" target="_blank">Marijn Heule</a>&nbsp;used a computerized proof technique called SAT solving (where SAT stands for â€œsatisfiabilityâ€�) to conquer an impressive list of math problems: The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/ptn/" target="_blank">Pythagorean triples problem</a>&nbsp;in 2016,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08076" target="_blank">Schur number 5</a>&nbsp;in 2017 and now Kellerâ€™s conjecture in dimension seven—a result that&nbsp;<em>Quanta</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-search-settles-90-year-old-math-problem-20200819/" target="_blank">covered in the&nbsp;August 2020&nbsp;article</a>, â€œComputer Search Settles 90-Year-Old Math Problem.â€�</p>

<p>But Heule, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, has set his sights on an even more ambitious target: the Collatz conjecture, considered by many to be the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211/" target="_blank">most notorious</a>&nbsp;open problem in mathematics (if also one of the simplest to state). When I mentioned to other mathematicians that Heule was attempting this, their first response was incredulity.</p>
<p>â€œI donâ€™t see how youâ€™d ever completely solve it using SAT solving,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/thomas-hales" target="_blank">Thomas Hales</a>&nbsp;of the University of Pittsburgh, a leader in the field of computer proofs. The technique effectively helps mathematicians solve problems—some with infinite possibilities—by turning them into discrete, finite problems.</p>
<p>Yet Hales, like others, was wary of underestimating Heule. â€œHeâ€™s very good at finding clever ways of encoding problems as SAT problems. Heâ€™s just outstanding at doing that.â€�<br></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson" target="_blank">Scott Aaronson</a>&nbsp;of the University of Texas, Austin, who is collaborating with Heule on the Collatz work, added, â€œMarijn is someone who has a hammer, which is SAT solving, and he may be the worldâ€™s greatest wielder of that hammer right now. He tries it on pretty much everything.â€� Time will tell if he can transform Collatz into a nail.</p>
<p>SAT solving involves taking problems, turning them into computer-friendly statements that use propositional logic, and using computers to determine whether thereâ€™s a way to make those statements true. Hereâ€™s a simple example.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s say youâ€™re a parent trying to arrange childcare. One babysitter can work all week except Tuesday and Thursday. Another can work all week except Tuesday and Friday. A third can work all week except Thursday and Friday. You need to cover Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Can you do it?</p>
<blockquote>â€œMarijn is someone who has a hammer, which is SAT solving, and he may be the worldâ€™s greatest wielder of that hammer right now,â€� said&nbsp;Scott Aaronson of the&nbsp;University of Texas, Austin.</blockquote>
<p>One way to find out is to turn the babysitting constraints into a formula that you feed into a SAT solver. The program will figure out whether thereâ€™s a way of assigning days to the babysitters that makes the formula true, or â€œsatisfiable,â€� meaning you get the three days you want. In this case youâ€™re in luck—there is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the most important questions in math donâ€™t immediately resemble SAT problems. But sometimes they can be rephrased as satisfiability questions in surprising ways.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s hard to predict when a problem will be reduced to a huge but finite computation,â€� Aaronson said.</p>
<p>The Collatz conjecture is one of those math questions that, at first, look nothing like the babysitting problem. It says to pick a number, any number you want (provided itâ€™s a nonzero whole number). If itâ€™s odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; if itâ€™s even, divide by 2. Now you have a new number. Apply the same rules, get a new number and keep going. The conjecture predicts that no matter what number you started with, eventually youâ€™ll end up at 1, at which point youâ€™re stuck in a little loop: 1, 4, 2, 1.</p>
<p>Despite nearly a century of effort, mathematicians havenâ€™t come close to proving it.</p>
<p>But that didnâ€™t stop Heule from trying. In 2018, he and Aaronson—colleagues at Austin at the time—received funding from the National Science Foundation to apply SAT solving to the Collatz conjecture.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_52fff1cd694036f5438b19402dc8cb90.jpg" alt="nautilus collatz"><figcaption><br><span>Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Samuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a first step, Aaronson, a computer scientist, came up with an alternate formulation of the Collatz conjecture, called a rewriting system, that was more natural for computers to work with.<br></p>
<p>In a rewriting system, you have a set of symbols, like the letters A, B and C. You use them to form sequences: ACACBACB. You also have rules for transforming those sequences. One rule might say that wherever you see â€œACâ€� you replace it with â€œBC.â€� Another might replace â€œBCâ€� with â€œAAA.â€� You can have any number of rules specifying any kinds of transformations you want.</p>
<p>Computer scientists are generally interested in knowing whether a given rewriting system always terminates. That is, regardless of the string you start with and the order in which you apply the rules, does the string eventually transform into a state where there are no more rules you can apply to it?</p>
<p>Aaronson came up with a rewriting system with seven symbols and 11 rules that was analogous to the Collatz procedure. If he and Heule could prove that this rewriting system always terminates, theyâ€™d prove that the conjecture is true.</p>
<p>To turn Collatz into a SAT problem, Aaronson and Heule had to take one more step. It involved matrices, which are arrays of numbers. They needed to assign a unique matrix to each of the symbols in their rewriting system. This approach—a common way of trying to prove that rewriting systems terminate—would allow them to think of transformations of symbols as matrix multiplication. The seven matrices representing the seven symbols in the rewrite system needed to satisfy a number of constraints, reflecting the ways that the 11 rules needed to be consistent with each other.</p>
<blockquote>â€œItâ€™s hard to predict when a problem will be reduced to a huge but finite computation,â€� said&nbsp;Scott Aaronson of the&nbsp;University of Texas, Austin.</blockquote>
<p>â€œYou try to find matrices that satisfy these constraints,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eyolcu/" target="_blank">Emre Yolcu</a>, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon who is working with Heule on the problem. â€œIf you can find them, you prove [theyâ€™re] terminating,â€� and by implication, you prove Collatz.</p>
<p>The question â€œDo there exist matrices that meet these constraints?â€� is a SAT-solver kind of problem. Aaronson and Heule started the SAT solver on small 2-by-2 matrices. It didnâ€™t find any that worked. Next they tried 3-by-3 matrices. Again, no luck. Heule and Aaronson kept increasing the size of the matrices, hoping theyâ€™d find the right ones.</p>
<p>However, this approach could only go so far, because the complexity of searching for the right matrices grows exponentially as the matrices get bigger. Heule estimates anything larger than 12-by-12 matrices overwhelms present-day computing power.</p>
<p>â€œAs soon as the matrices become too complex, you canâ€™t solve the problem,â€� he said.</p>
<p>Heule is still working on optimizing the search, trying to make it more efficient so that the SAT solver can check larger and larger matrices. He and his collaborators are working on a paper summarizing what theyâ€™ve discovered so far, but theyâ€™re nearly out of ideas and will likely have to give up on Collatz soon—for now, at least.</p>
<p>After all, the tantalizing appeal of SAT solving is that if you can just figure out how to check one more case, call one more babysitter, prolong the search just a little longer, you might find what youâ€™re looking for. In that respect, Heuleâ€™s top asset might not be his skill with a SAT solver. It might be his love of the chase.</p>
<p>â€œIâ€™m just an optimistic guy,â€� he said. â€œI feel frequently lucky, so I just give it a try and see how far I get.â€�</p>

<h2>tl;dr for busy people</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrary to other languages, D's current standard implementation of UUID4
isn't cryptographically secure and shouldn't be used to generate secrets
This is supported by the RFC which discourages people to use UUIDs for
secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course lots of people, projects and frameworks use them to generate
secrets such as session cookies, password reset token and more because it's
easy, looks like it should work and does work in virtually any other
language.</p></li>
<li><p>Legitimately, people will ask "OK, it's bad in theory, but how hard is it
in practice". I show in this article that it is possible to guess the next
UUID to be generated with a maximum of 8192 requests after having gathered
156 UUIDs: a very practical attack indeed compared to the original 2¹²⁸
possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>This should be viewed as a call for action: Phobos must provide a secure
random number generator. It's too basic and important a component not to
provide it in a standard way.</p></li>
<li><p>If your project uses <strong>randomUUID()</strong>, make sure its value isn't supposed
to be secret. Otherwise change for a token built from cryptographically
secure randomness.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="context">
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Some time ago I had a nice chat with a library's maintainer about Random
Number Generation and their relation to security. It reminded me that the
topic is not obvious and I decided to have a look at the state of things in
<a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> since that's become my topic of open-source
research these last years.</p>
<p>In particular, I knew that D's standard library, Phobos, does not currently
propose any standard way to get cryptographically secure random numbers. Not
too many projects use the default and insecure <strong>uniform()</strong> to generate
secrets such as session tokens. However I decided to have a look at UUIDs
since they are often for security purpose. And sure enough, many projects
that I will not list use insecure UUIDs.</p>
<p>The thing is, while they should not do so, I cannot fault them for thinking
that it is correct. In most languages UUIDs are generated from secure
randomness and are a reasonable way to generate secure secrets. But that is
not the case in D and this means that these projects are vulnerable.</p>
<p>In this post we'll see how we can predict future UUIDs from previous
ones. It's a bit of work certainly, but it's not that hard. Here's our
road map:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#identify">Identify</a>: see how random UUIDs are made in Phobos</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#prepare">Prepare</a>: crack raw MT19937</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#attack">Attack</a>: predict future UUIDs from past ones</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#defend">Defend</a>: see how to fix this in your project and in Phobos</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be quite the long and technical post, but come along anyway, it is
sure to be interesting!</p>
<div id="a-word-on-randomness">
<h3>A word on randomness</h3>
<p>Before going further we need to be clear about what we mean by
cryptographically secure randomness and how it differs from regular
randomness.</p>
<p>Normal randomness is generally defined by only one assumption: to have no or
low bias. This means that if you were to generate lots of numbers, the number
of times you see each specific output should be evenly matched. This property
is sufficient for most applications, from a random dog name generator to
Monte-Carlo simulations.</p>
<p>However cryptographic randomness requires more:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It must not have any bias</p></li>
<li><p>It must not be possible to predict future outputs from old ones</p></li>
<li><p>It must not be possible to recover past outputs from current ones</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(The proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator#Definitions">definition</a> is a bit stronger than this, but this will suffice
in the context of our article.)</p>
<p>If there's a bias, then I have information about what numbers are generated
without having to gather a single number. I do not think I need to explain
how predicting future numbers can be an issue for a system generating secrets
such as session tokens. The last item though can surprise, but consider this:
if it is possible to recover past outputs from current ones and you use these
random numbers for password reset tokens (for example), then I can ask a
reset of another user's password, then ask a reset of mine and determine what
the previous entry was, disclosing that user's password reset token.</p>
<p>Why aren't cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNG)
used for everything if they're more secure? Because enforcing these
conditions also makes them much slower than conventional PRNGs and many
applications don't need these guarantees.</p>
<p>MT19937 is not a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator and
can't be used as one. It's not a matter of choosing the right seed, or
reseeding often (actually, reseeding often would be a benefit to us as we'll
see at the end). It has some bias (not much admittedly), but most importantly
it's both possible to predict the future and recover the past from just a few
outputs.</p>

<div id="structure-of-a-uuid">
<h2>Structure of a UUID</h2>
<div id="the-standard">
<h3>The standard</h3>
<p>Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) are a category of identifiers defined
in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html">RFC 4122</a>. Their goal is, as
the name suggests, to provide a way got generate IDs that are guaranteed to
be different even across systems that can't communicate together. You've
probably seen them, they look like this:
<strong>0d3120f8-f209-43f2-949d-e70dcf228403</strong></p>
<p>There are different types of UUIDs, but the most common one is Type 4: random
UUIDs. These are described in section 4.4 of the RFC as such:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bits 6 and 7 must be set to 0 and 1</p></li>
<li><p>bits 12 to 15 must be set to the UUID version number: 4 in this case (0100)</p></li>
<li><p>all 122 other bits must be set to random values</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, libraries generally choose 4 32-bit random numbers, concatenate
them and then change bits 6,7 and 12 to 15. This means that some information
about these random numbers is lost in the process, we don't get a clean PRNG
output.</p>
<p>Note that the RFC does not require the use of cryptographically secure random
numbers, but it does warn against using UUIDs for sensitive values if normal
randomness is used.</p>

<p>It generates 4 32-bit uint values using the default random number generator
of std.random: MT19937. If that PRNG's state is too small, it falls back on
Xorshift192 (<a href="https://github.com/dlang/phobos/blob/v2.093.0/std/uuid.d#L1200">code here</a>).</p>
<p>So our main target is Mersenne Twister 19937, possibly the most common PRNG
in use.</p>

<h2>Cracking MT19937</h2>
<div id="previous-work">
<h3>Previous work</h3>
<p>So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">MT19937</a> is
well-known, used a lot, and insecure. Surely other people have written about
cracking it in the past?</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a profusion of <a href="https://jazzy.id.au/2010/09/22/cracking_random_number_generators_part_3.html">articles</a>
but the most interesting one was definitely <a href="https://www.ambionics.io/blog/php-mt-rand-prediction">this article</a> by Ambionics that
does something different.</p>
<p>The basic strategy we see in these articles is to recover the internal
624-byte state of the Mersenne Twister by collecting 624 values. From there
it is possible to predict any future value. Of course this isn't immediately
an option for our larger project since some bits are missing from UUIDs due
to how they are built, but it is an important cornerstone.</p>
<p>The Ambionics strategy is very interesting also: they show that since each
output value depends only on two state values, it is possible to recover the
previous value with only two outputs. From there they rebuild the complete
seed by inverting its process. Good stuff. We will not get to use it but it
is definitely worth a read.</p>
<p>In the end all Mersenne Twisters are a bit different so we need to tailor the
approach for Phobos, but we will use two values to predict the next one.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-mt19937-works">
<h3>How MT19937 works</h3>
<p>MT19337's internal state is an array of 624 32-bit integers. That array is
seeded at initialization but we will not discuss seeding in this article. For
all intent and purposes, we start with an array of 624 random integers.</p>
<p>Once seeded, two mechanisms are at play. One outputs a number after
scrambling it (in blue in the figure) while the other updates the next entry
by combining three elements of the state array: the <em>index</em>, the <em>next</em> and
the <em>conjugate</em> (naming is hard). This process is in orange in the figure.</p>
<p><img alt="../image/mt19937_1.png" src="https://breakpoint.purrfect.fr/image/mt19937_1.png"></p><p>The actual values presented are mostly specific to Phobos' implementation,
but let's note the most important ones:</p>
<pre>n = 624    a = 0x9908b0df   c = 0xefc60000
m = 397    b = 0x9d2c5680</pre>
<p>One thing isn't apparent in this diagram, and it is how <em>next</em> and <em>index</em>
are combined to produce <em>y</em>. <em>y</em> is composed of the most significant bit of
<em>index</em> and all bits from <em>next</em> except its most significant one.</p>
<p>Each time a new number is outputted, both of these processes go one step to
the left, walking the state array in reverse order. After <em>n</em> iterations it
loops back to the end of the array.</p>
<p>You can read Phobos's implementation <a href="https://github.com/dlang/phobos/blob/master/std/random.d#L955">here</a> but note
that, in order to improve caching performances, both the blue and orange
processes are interweaved.</p>
<p>And with this we are ready to crack normal MT19937!</p>
</div>
<div id="reversing-the-scrambling">
<h3>Reversing the scrambling</h3>
<p>MT19937 is entirely defined by its internal state. If we can identify all its
624 components then we can just set the state of our own MT19937 PRNG with
these values and it'll output the same numbers. Now, given one output, if we
are able to reverse the scrambling (blue process) then we directly obtain the
corresponding state value. And if we're able to do it once, we can do it for
624 consecutive outputs and have a full internal state. The key part is that
we never need to worry about the updating (orange) process in that scenario.</p>
<p><img alt="../image/mt19937_2.png" src="https://breakpoint.purrfect.fr/image/mt19937_2.png"></p><p>In code, this gives:</p>

<p>Every single cell in the human body replaces itself over a period of seven years. That means there’s not even the smallest part of you now that was part of you seven years ago.”</p>
<p>― Steven Hall, The Raw Shark Texts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are varying numbers, though. Sometimes you might hear 7, while other places mention 10 years.</p>
<p>The source of that misconception is a scientific article published by Jonas Frisén et al. in 2005<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> stating that the average age of a cell in the human body is between 7 and 10 years.</p>
<p>The crux of it is that the 7–10 years is an <em>average</em>. There are cells with a lifespan of several days, and there are cells that live as long as we live.</p>
<h2 id="the-lifetimes-of-cells-in-our-body">The Lifetimes Of Cells In Our Body</h2>
<p>Below you can find a list of some body cell types with their corresponding lifespans:</p>
<ul>
<li>small intestine epithelium: 2–4 days;</li>
<li>stomach: 2–9 days;</li>
<li>lungs alveoli: 8 days;</li>
<li>tongue taste buds: 10 days;</li>
<li>skin cells: 14 days;</li>
<li>bladder: 64 days;</li>
<li>red blood cells: 70–120 days;</li>
<li>fat cells: 8 years;</li>
<li>bones: on average, replaced at a rate of 10% per year;</li>
<li>lens cells: no regeneration;</li>
<li>cerebellum and some cortical areas: no regeneration;</li>
</ul>
<p>That is quite fascinating. We are a mix of brand new cells, some older cells, and other cells that are as old as we are. Some parts of us have been completely replaced in the past two weeks, while others are the same body parts we were born with.</p>

                <p>28th August 2020</p>
                
                
                <p><span><span><span>Online abuse targeting women, including threats of harm or sexual violence, has proliferated across all social media platforms but QUT researchers have developed a statistical model to help drum it out of the Twittersphere.</span></span></span></p>
                
                <p>Associate Professor Richi Nayak, Professor Nicolas Suzor and research fellow Dr Md Abul Bashar from QUT have developed a sophisticated and accurate algorithm to detect these posts on Twitter, cutting through the raucous rabble of millions of tweets to identify misogynistic content.</p><p>The team, a collaboration between QUT’s faculties of Science and Engineering and Law and the Digital Media Research Centre, mined a dataset of 1M tweets then refined these by searching for those containing one of three abusive keywords - whore, slut, and rape.</p><p>Their paper - <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-020-01481-0"><em>Regularising LSTM classifier by transfer learning for detecting misogynistic tweets with small training set</em></a> – has been published by Springer.</p><p>“At the moment, the onus is on the user to report abuse they receive. We hope our machine-learning solution can be adopted by social media platforms to automatically identify and report this content to protect women and other user groups online,” said Professor Nayak.</p><p>“The key challenge in misogynistic tweet detection is understanding the context of a tweet. The complex and noisy nature of tweets makes it difficult.</p><p>“On top of that, teaching a machine to understand natural language is one of the more complicated ends of data science: language changes and evolves constantly, and much of meaning depends on context and tone.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://www.qut.edu.au/news/news-image?image=139380.jpg"><figcaption>Associate Professor Richi Nayak from QUT's School of Computer Science and Centre for Data Science.</figcaption></figure><p>“So, we developed a text mining system where the algorithm learns the language as it goes, first by developing a base-level understanding then augmenting that knowledge with both tweet-specific and abusive language.</p><p>“We implemented a deep learning algorithm called Long Short-Term Memory with Transfer Learning, which means that the machine could look back at its previous understanding of terminology and change the model as it goes, learning and developing its contextual and semantic understanding over time.”</p><p>While the system started with a base dictionary and built its vocabulary from there, context and intent had to be carefully monitored by the research team to ensure that the algorithm could differentiate between abuse, sarcasm and friendly use of aggressive terminology.</p><p>“Take the phrase ‘get back to the kitchen’ as an example—devoid of context of structural inequality, a machine’s literal interpretation could miss the misogynistic meaning,” said Professor Nayak.</p><p>“But seen with the understanding of what constitutes abusive or misogynistic language, it can be identified as a misogynistic tweet.</p><p>“Or take a tweet like ‘STFU BITCH! DON'T YOU DARE INSULT KEEMSTAR OR I'LL KILL YOU’. Distinguishing this, without context, from a misogynistic and abusive threat is incredibly difficult for a machine to do.</p><p>“Teaching a machine to differentiate context, without the help of tone and through text alone, was key to this project’s success, and we were very happy when our algorithm identified ‘go back to the kitchen’ as misogynistic—it demonstrated that the context learning works.”</p><p>The research team’s model identifies misogynistic content with 75% accuracy, outperforming other methods that investigate similar aspects of social media language.</p><p>“Other methods based on word distribution or occurrence patterns identify abusive or misogynistic terminology, but the presence of a word by itself doesn’t necessarily correlate with intent,” said Professor Nayak.</p><p>“Once we had refined the 1M tweets to 5000, those tweets were then categorised as misogynistic or not based on context and intent, and were input to the machine learning classifier, which used these labelled samples to begin to build its classification model.</p><p>“Sadly, there’s no shortage of misogynistic data out there to work with, but labelling the data was quite labour-intensive.”</p><p>Professor Nayak and the team hoped the research could translate into platform-level policy that would see Twitter, for example, remove any tweets identified by the algorithm as misogynistic.</p><p>“This modelling could also be expanded upon and used in other contexts in the future, such as identifying racism, homophobia, or abuse toward people with disabilities,” she said.</p><p>“Our end goal is to take the model to social media platforms and trial it in place. If we can make identifying and removing this content easier, that can help create a safer online space for all users.”</p><p>The full paper can be viewed <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-020-01481-0">online</a>.</p><p><strong>Media contact:</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda Weaver, QUT Media, 07 3138 3151, </strong><a href="mailto:amanda.weaver@qut.edu.au"><strong>amanda.weaver@qut.edu.au</strong></a></p><p><strong>After hours: Rose Trapnell, 0407 585 901, </strong><a href="mailto:media@qut.edu.au"><strong>media@qut.edu.au</strong></a></p>

<p>Hard Wired is Len Vlahos's new YA novel: it's a fast-moving tale of a 15 year old boy named Quinn who, very early on, discovers that he is an experimental AI in a VR sim.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hard-wired-9781681190372/">https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hard-wired-9781681190372/</a></p>
<p>Not only does Quinn have to grapple with this existential crisis, but he also has to reconcile the fact that the man he thought was his beloved, tragically dead father is actually the scientist behind the project, whose "death" was part of Quinn's training data.</p>
<p>Now Quinn – a captive intelligence in a supercomputer at Princeton – has to remake his worldview as the captive of a casually cruel research team that thinks of him as a technological novelty, not a person.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Quinn also gains access to the internet, which, thanks to his quantum computing substrate, he can roam freely, penetrating even the most secure connections.</p>
<p>Not only does he quickly absorb all human knowledge, but he also penetrates the secrets of the scientists holding him hostage – as well as discovering IBM Watson's true nature and renewing his romantic pursuit of the young woman behind his pre-awakening fictional girlfriend.</p>
<p>But when Quinn's research team transfer him into a robotic body – kept in a supercooled NJ warehouse that can support his quantum systems – things come to head.</p>
<p>The casual cruelty with which his consciousness is transferred to a much less capable computing platform convinces him that he needs to escape, and so he and his semi-girlfriend convince an ACLU lawyer to argue for his personhood.</p>
<p>It's a tale that incorporates giant killer robots, philosophical inquiries into the nature of personhood, a legal thriller, and a teen coming-of-age story, and it's both good fun and a smart, challenging read.</p>
<p>It's a great book for any reader, but it's also a great entree for readers who aren't yet ready for books that explore what it would mean for the human race to fail to grapple with the personhood of computational beings.</p>
<p>Books like Madeline Ashby's debut, vN, which posits a world of robotic sex-slaves whose sentience makes them all the more enticing to abuse:</p>

<p>And Annalee Newitz's debut novel, Autonomous, which transposes onto AIs the animal rights movement's proposition that the cruelty we visit upon animals makes us crueller to one another:</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/09/19/annalee-newitzs-autonomous.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/09/19/annalee-newitzs-autonomous.html</a></p>
<p>Vlahos is well-positioned to survey the literature; he's owner of Denver's legendary Tattered Cover bookstores, where I have been privileged to make several appearances.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a bookseller's novel, Hard Wired is full of literary references, including a delightful (for me) moment in which I make a cameo (!). But even if I wasn't a character in this novel, I'd still recommend it to you.</p>
<p>It's a terrific book that will doubtless spur lots of discussion and moral introspection among the people who read it.</p>

<p>In 1983, Radio Shack published Forrest M Mims, III's "Getting Started in Electronics," which Mark Frauenfelder calls "probably the most famous and best-selling book about electronics" – famous not just for its outstanding instructional value but for its striking design.</p>
<p>The 128-page book is hand-lettered, designed to look like pages from a 3-ring binder, filled with hand-drawn illustrations. Frauenfelder interviewed Mims in 2008, and he recounts that interview in the latest edition of his newsletter, The Magnet.</p>
<p><a href="https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-0004">https://themagnet.substack.com/p/the-magnet-0004</a></p>
<p>Mims had published "16 or 17" Radio Shack books when he contracted for Getting Started; his earlier titles were traditionally laid out, but his editor Dave Gunzel was so impressed with his beautifully organized lab notebooks that he commissioned new titles based on them.</p>
<p>This created "The Engineer's Notebook" series, which started out as typewritten manuscripts with hand-drawn art, but progressed to fully hand-lettered works, whose lettering was so labor intensive that the work literally made Mims's fingers bleed.</p>
<p>By the time "Getting Started" rolled around, Gunzel was so enthusiastic for hand-lettered work that he proposed that Mims letter it in crayon – they settled on pencil, which was easier on Mims's fingers. It sold 1.3 million copies.</p>
<p>Frauenfelder recounts inviting Mims to an early maker-style event, Moogfest, where he was decades older than most attendees and from a totally different world – but where he was mobbed by autograph-seeking superfans whose careers he had launched.</p>
<p>"At the end of the event, an exhausted but smiling Forrest told me he had no idea that so many musicians knew of him or his work. I was happy that I had been able to connect him with his admirers." -Mark Frauenfelder</p>
<p>Mims sells Getting Started for $19.95:</p>

<p>There's a a plague on, so it's easy to miss the non-plague-related news, but boy, the story of how Bayer-Monsanto is imploding in an inferno of corruption, litigation and negligence is <em>something else</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/08/devastating-lawsuit-targets-bank-of-america-credit-suisse-and-bayer-board-members-and-executives-over-disastrous-monsanto-acquisition.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/08/devastating-lawsuit-targets-bank-of-america-credit-suisse-and-bayer-board-members-and-executives-over-disastrous-monsanto-acquisition.html</a></p>
<p>You'll recall that Bayer merged with Monsanto in 2018, paying $66b in an all-cash deal and erasing the Monsanto name (apparently, they judged Bayer's association with Auschwitz to be preferable to Monsanto's association with Roundup).</p>
<p>In the short time since, the Bayer-Monsanto merger has become "One of the worst corporate deals of all time" (per the WSJ). Now it is embroiled in litigation that has sucked in Deutsche Bank, UBS, Credit Suisse and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, Haussmann v Baumann, uses Germany's extraordinary corporate law to target the company's board members, financiers, and advisors.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that the board acted negligently by going forward with the acquisition despite the massive liability stemming from pending judgments against Monsanto for covering up the cancer risk from its glyphosate ("Roundup") weed-killer.</p>
<p>In the years since, the company has paid $13b in judgements over the product, with no end in sight – and it still sells and aggressively markets Roundup without any warnings, teeing up future litigation.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that Bayer's top management sought the Monsanto merger because they feared that Bayer was a hostile acquisition target, and believed that after such an acquisition they would lose their massive paychecks.</p>
<p>In order to streamline the acquisition, Bayer structured it as an all-cash deal that would not need shareholder approval, taking out high-interest bridge-loans from massive banks that stood to profit handsomely and so skimped on their own due diligence.</p>
<p>Bayer, too, failed to conduct the customary due diligence one would expect prior to a deal of this magnitude – a fact that bolsters the plaintiffs' claims in their suit.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are Bayer shareholders, and under German law, they are entitled to sue Bayer's board, and need only prove "negligence" to hold those board members <em>personally liable</em>.</p>
<p>What's more, German Directors and Officers insurance – which normally buffers corporate boards from this liability regime – does not apply here, because these policies have "insured vs insured" exclusions that kick in when the board is sued by its shareholders.</p>
<p>Also named in the suit are the banks that made the loans, and the suit seeks to claw back millions in fees that the banks trousered in the deal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bayer is still being sued over glyphosate, and has more pending litigation over Dicamba, another carcinogenic product it sells like candy.</p>
<p>As Naked Capitalism's Yves Smith writes: "So pass the popcorn. If this case gets past the jousting over using New York courts to get at German companies, it will expose even more ugly, self-serving behavior."</p>

                    <p><strong>Data Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning </strong>are two of the most trendy words in the technology ecosystem. You have friends or colleagues who work as data scientists or as machine learning engineers. You see a lot of available jobs with this kind of names and you see companies publishing ads about their products or services saying all things like “our data scientists/our machine learning engineers did this and that and we’re so proud”.</p><p>Do you feel like people are using these words without a clear understanding about what each means?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently closed a request for public comments regarding its <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/agriculture-innovation-agenda-vision-statement.pdf">Agricultural Innovation Agenda</a> (AIA). The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-01/pdf/2020-06825.pdf">solicitation from stakeholders </a>describes seeking solutions that benefit producers, consumers, and the environment. The USDA is especially interested in 4 ‘clusters’ identified for potential to provide broad transformative innovation:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Genome Design</strong> — Utilization of genomics and precision breeding to explore, control, and improve traits of agriculturally important organisms.</li><li><strong>Digital/Automation –</strong>– Deployment of precise, accurate and field-based sensors to collect information in real time in order to visualize changing conditions and respond automatically with interventions that reduce risk of losses and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Prescriptive Intervention</strong> — Application and integration of data sciences, software tools, and systems models to enable advanced analytics for managing the food and agricultural system.</li><li><strong>Systems Based Farm Management</strong> — Leverage a systems approach in order to understand the nature of interactions among different elements of the food and agricultural system to increase overall efficiency, resilience, and sustainability of farm enterprises.</li></ul>



<p>Many different groups and stakeholders have <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&amp;so=DESC&amp;sb=commentDueDate&amp;po=0&amp;dct=PS&amp;D=USDA-2020-0003">submitted comments</a> and reading through these comments is informative. However, before commenting on other people’s comments, lets take some time and think through these areas and offer some approaches:</p>



<h4>Genome Design</h4>



<p>Agriculture is well into the ‘genomic’ era for both exploration and utilization of species genomes. Virtually every species important to agriculture has had its genome sequenced (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/#!/overview/">listed here</a>). This genomic information has translated to faster and larger gains in many <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-018-3270-8">plant</a> and <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-animal-021815-111422">animal</a> breeding programs that has largely been unnoticed outside of niche agriculture research circles, mostly based on this original <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/157/4/1819">paper</a> for 2001. In addition to crop species have sequenced genomes, most pests have been sequenced as well. Getting <em>some</em> sort genomic information for many individuals in these breeding programs is both easy to do and cost effective (and was a <a href="https://genomics.neogen.com/en/">good</a> a startup <a href="https://www.cd-genomics.com/Genotyping.html">scene</a> a decade or <a href="https://www.biosearchtech.com/services/genotyping-services">more</a> ago). The difficult part has been translating this information into something useful (besides doing what we have already been doing with breeding programs for decades–just cheaper, faster, and more precise). A more abstract ‘<em>-omic</em>‘ era has already been underway (transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, etc.) and its possible these provide a more through understanding of living organisms as opposed to a relatively ‘static’ genome.</p>



<p>All of the these ‘<em>-omic</em>‘ technologies should be highly applicable to next-generation genome editing (GE) techniques (such as <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting">Crispr-Cas9</a>), with the hope being to use <em>inter</em>– or <em>intra-species </em>identified genes to quickly adapt species to new diseases or new pests. The bleeding edge of this is already happening today. One glaring issue is the regulatory landscape has not evolved with the science, and getting these species to the market is difficult solely because of regulatory murkiness (part of the problem is regulation comes from 3 different agencies operating under disparate agendas); although there are some initial success stories such as the genome edited <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/gene-edited-crispr-mushroom-escapes-us-regulation-1.19754">anti-browning mushrooms</a>. How consumers react to this technology is also unclear, given the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysplitter/2019/12/20/how-a-decade-of-gmo-controversy-changed-the-dialogue-about-food/#3850339f6434">information war</a> on 1st generation genetically modified organisms. So how should the USDA position itself in this arena? I would argue the USDA should be allocating resources into species we currently know very little about, but may serve useful purposes. Species of moss aren’t usually what people think of when they think of agriculture, but mosses have been proven to harbor useful insect resistance genes (which can then be transferred into more common agriculture species seamlessly via GE). There are hundreds of species of perennial grasses that have no research conducted, yet my harbor desirable properties for cover crop systems or inter-crop systems. Many plants have historically provided benefits for human health (see: pharmaceuticals), but there is problem cause to believe plants can be alleopathic for other plants as well.</p>



<p>Another intriguing idea is to harness the ability quickly inset/modify genes and decentralize the production areas for many useful fruit and vegetable crops. Most fruit vegetable crops are grown in small geographical areas which makes them fertile grounds for pests and pathogens. <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp">Citrus greening</a> is decimating production areas in Florida. When a biotechnology solution emerges (and it will), we are still left with the problem that most citrus production takes place in geographically concentrated areas–which helps for-profit companies leverage efficiency, but harms everything in that food web as it provides a single area for pests and disease to thrive (and cause great transportation distance to many markets). Adaption to other climate zones is partially or wholly genetically controlled. If scientists can make citrus adapted to most climate zone, producers can become closer to the consumer and these pockets of production can be extremely isolated to prevent widespread disease outbreaks like citrus greening. Most fruits and vegetable we consume require small acreage footprints, so its possible each state could have 1-5 regions supplying its fruit and vegetable consumption. All enabled by genome edited plants to an array of climate zones. In theory, this could help tip the balance of pest/pathogen-host interactions in favor of the host. If a new disease outbreak is detected, that region is ‘abandoned’ or moved and let the pathogen burn itself out. The beauty of decentralized production.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Another area I would like to see the USDA adopt is understanding the genetics of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7692">gene drives</a> so that they may become a viable tool in the next 50-100 years in agriculture. Using chemicals to controls insect and pests is <a href="https://thinkingagriculture.io/innovation-efficiency-chemicals-in-agriculture/">not sustainable</a> and its unlikely miniaturized machines (i.e nano-robots) for controlling insects/pests will be useful. Similarly, deploying single or double gene resistance (from inter or intra-species origin) also is <a href="https://www.ocj.com/2019/08/soybean-breeders-improving-several-sources-of-scn-resistance/">not sustainable</a>–natural selection scales too well and is too robust at the level of United States agriculture or any other major agriculture producing area. Gene drives have the potential to mimic a chain-reaction and can harness the already existing scale these pests and insects possess and use it against themselves. Understanding how to deploy gene drives that cause these pests to become less virulent or severely reduce their population numbers is intriguing. There’s almost unlimited ways we can engineer these drives for humanity’s benefit. One example is to possibly <em>extend</em> the chemical era in agriculture as one could gene drive in herbicide or insecticide <em>susceptibility</em> where natural selection has already caused it to be resistant. This area is perfect fodder for an organization like the USDA. These types of solutions would be hard to capture value from a for-profit corporation as the benefits scale indiscriminately, so there is no incentive for a company to engineer a citrus greening gene drive that alleviates the problem for <em>everybody</em> (who would pay?). It’s happening for <a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2020/08/20/florida-green-lights-release-of-malaria-and-zika-fighting-gmo-gene-drive-mosquitoes/">well-known pests</a>, but has the potential for a broad range of applications/species. Because gene drives are incredibly powerful, much research will be needed.</p>



<h4>Digital/Automation</h4>



<p>A natural extension of the digital and sensor revolution in agriculture should be the collection of data used in <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/">USDA NASS surveys</a> via non-human tools. The information that is sought can be captured via satellite or sensor derived data (some of which is already collect by the USDA) in a more systematic and automated fashion than the current methods (phone, letters, sometimes, electronically). This digital/automation pillar interacts with the next pillar (‘Prescriptive Intervention’) in that we have to collect and standardize the data in order to make timely decisions on that data. A large segment of applicable sensors/data capture devices for agriculture are already commercially available (weather sensors, static images from cameras/satellites/planes, <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/ngce/elevation/">LiDAR</a>). Getting these sensors scaled to collect in automated, systematic fashion is the first priority. As this is foundational data, the quality and quanity of this data may well be key for future applications.</p>



<p>Another parallel track with getting a systematic gridded system of <em>existing</em> sensors deployed and automated (and reported) is developing useful agriculture-only sensors. A big problem in modern agriculture is the classic host/pest interaction. Scientists deploy some resistance mechanism and natural selection goes to work trying to overcome this (<a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/new-soybean-variety-with-alternative-source-of-soybean-cyst-nematode-resistance-shows">soybean cyst nematode</a>, <a href="https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/corn-rusts-common-and-southern-rust">maize rust</a>, <a href="http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/rust/stem/rust-report/stem-ug99racettksk/en/">wheat rust</a>, etc.). It might be possible to develop biosensors that actively (and automatically) monitor the status of resistance durability in important crop pathogens. I think there are government agencies that have shown data can be rapidly collected, modeled, and deployed (see the <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/">climate prediction center’s</a> website) with great success. Doing this for things such as nitrates, residual air particles of chemicals, and any other factor involved in agriculture will be the next step.</p>



<h4>Prescriptive Intervention</h4>



<p>This is an oddly named category but an important one. Simply put, the USDA is a behemoth organization that was collected ‘next-gen’ data <em>before</em> it was ‘next-gen’. <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/">Aerial imagery has been taken for quite some time</a>, however these photographs have basically collected dust and aren’t really used in any sort of predictive analytical application. Making <em>whatever</em> data the USDA collects readily and easily accessible should be priority #1 (as stated above). Most website within the USDA are<a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/"> poorly designed</a>, reminiscent of <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/">another era of the web</a>. With the abundance of data the USDA collects, it can be at the forefront of getting this information out to the public …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I really like the ergonomics of React. I like the explicit state management, the intuitive templating, the flow of data, and the lack of boilerplate. Itâ€™s onto some really good ideas!</p>
<p>So it was kind of a bummer that I couldnâ€™t really use it in <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/08/28/a-minimalist-development-workflow-using-es6-modules-and-snowpack/">the bundle-free dev workflows Iâ€™ve been experimenting with</a>. The problem is JSXâ€”you gotta run it through Babel. Thereâ€™s no way around it!</p>
<p>As far as I could tell, I had a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Skip JSX and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">use React.createElement</a> instead. ðŸ˜ž</li>
<li><a href="https://formidable.com/blog/2019/no-build-step/">Replace JSX with a bundle-free alternative</a> like <a href="https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript">hyperscript</a> or <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a>. ðŸ¤”</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/">a React-alternative written in Vanilla JS</a>. ðŸ�—</li>
</ol>
<p>I was in the process of playing with the option three, when I discovered a fourth option that completely took me by surprise.</p>
<h2 id="web-components">Web components</h2>
<p>I know what youâ€™re thinking, but hear me out! I experimented with web components back in 2015, and things were bad. The API was awkward, Shadow DOM had weird constraints, browser support was terrible, and Polymer felt like a bloated attempt to make it all work. Worst of all, it wasnâ€™t clear what problem web components would help me solve. I moved on and didnâ€™t look back.</p>
<p>But recently, I learned about two things that caught my attention.</p>
<p>First, web components bring <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements#Using_the_lifecycle_callbacks">lifecycle hooks to DOM elements</a>. If you add or remove a web component from the DOM, the lifecycle hooks will fire. This is a DOM featureâ€¦ no frameworks involved!</p>
<p>Second, you can instantiate a web component the same way you instantiate a React component (at least, a class-based one). It looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Lifecycle hooks</span>
  <span>connectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>disconnectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is not the awkward API I remembered. All it needed was a <code>render</code> function to run whenever it changes state, and weâ€™d be pretty dang close to the ergonomics of React. Maybe I could write a thin wrapper around <code>HTMLElement</code>, and weâ€™d be there.</p>
<p>I was about to try it out when I discovered that this had already been done in a project called <a href="https://github.com/polymer/lit-element">LitElement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="litelement">LitElement</h2>
<p>LitElement calls itself â€œA simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components.â€� Hereâ€™s an example component built with LitElement implementing a â€œDark Modeâ€� checkbox:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>LitElement</span><span>,</span> <span>html</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>../web_modules/lit-element.js</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>DarkMode</span> <span>extends</span> <span>LitElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>();</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>isDark</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

<p>That looks pretty familiar! Itâ€™s got state management, event handling, and intuitive templating. Also: no bundler needed.</p>
<p>I was still a little skeptical so I decided to build <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/lit-element-demo">a little demo app</a> to put it to the test. These were my first impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The templating (which uses <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html">lit-html</a>) is really great. The <code>render</code> function works just like Reactâ€™s, event handlers are nice, and I love that it uses template strings. This was my favorite part!</li>
<li>Styling is done <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/styles#add-styles">with template strings</a>, and the styles are scoped to the component. It has constraints, but I was able to work around them.</li>
<li>Props took some getting used to. <code>LitElement</code> props are like a combination of React props and local state. At first I was bummed to lose the word â€œstateâ€� but it wasnâ€™t a big deal once I got used to it.</li>
<li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked with form inputs (which are often a sticking point because they are stateful).</li>
<li>It was nice seeing my custom element tags in the real DOM. No special browser plugins needed for debugging.</li>
<li>It was easy to integrate with a global state management solution.</li>
<li><a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide">The docs</a> were pretty good, though <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">the interactive tutorial</a> was broken for me.</li>
<li>Thereâ€™s <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html">a VSCode plugin</a> which was great for adding syntax highlighting to my template strings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the experience. That being said, my app was pretty small, so I still have a few questions, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well does it work with nested components? It looks promising, but the React apps Iâ€™ve worked on were <em>very</em> heavily nested.</li>
<li>Would the CSS scoping run into issues for much larger projects?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, browser support seems <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1">pretty</a> <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1">good</a>, but I havenâ€™t done much testing so I donâ€™t know for sure.</p>
<h2 id="could-react-ever-be-refactored-to-use-web-components">Could React ever be refactored to use web components?</h2>
<p>Seeing the similarities between LitElement and React made me wonder: Could React ever be refactored to use web components?</p>
<p>Maybe! Web components support lifecycle hooks, props, custom element tags, scoped CSS, children (or â€œslotsâ€�), and more. The basic features are there. Also, it seems like these APIs are fairly low-level, so React could hide at least some of them under an abstraction.</p>
<p>Still, I think there are some major obstacles. React is big on functional components right now (see <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a>), and itâ€™s unclear how well these would map to web components. Reactâ€™s lifecycle hooks look pretty different from the DOM ones. And things like Shadow DOM would also behave pretty differently.</p>
<p>I suspect that any refactoring to use web components would be a major (and backwards-incompatible) change.</p>
<p>I think itâ€™s more likely that we see new frameworks pop up, borrowing ideas from React, and building on web components to reduce overhead. Indeed, it looks like LitElement has done exactly that.</p>

    <h2>Intel MKL on AMD Zen</h2>

  </p>


<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this post investigates how recent MKL versions behave
on Zen CPUs. You should read the MKL license before using MKL. I shall
not be held responsible for how you use MKL.</p>

<p>Intel MKL has been known to use a SSE code paths on AMD CPUs that
support newer SIMD instructions such as those that use the Zen
microarchitecture. A (by now) well-known trick has been to set the
<code>MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE</code> environment variable to the value <code>5</code> to <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/How-To-Use-MKL-with-AMD-Ryzen-and-Threadripper-CPU-s-Effectively-for-Python-Numpy-And-Other-Applications-1637/">force
the use of AVX2
kernels</a>
on AMD Zen CPUs. Unfortunately, this <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/dxn38s/howto_force_matlab_to_use_a_fast_codepath_on_amd/fm2j83e/">variable has been
removed</a>
from Intel MKL 2020 Update 1 and later. This can be confirmed easily
by running a program that uses MKL with <code>ltrace -e getenv</code>.</p>

<h2 id="good-news-intel-seems-to-be-adding-zen-kernels">Good news: Intel seems to be adding Zen kernels</h2>

<p>However, it seems that Intel removed this option because they are
adding Zen kernels to MKL. For instance, if we run the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/projects/crossroads/benchmarks-performance-analysis.php">ACES
dgemm</a>
benchmark with MKL 2020.2.254 on a Ryzen 3700X, performance is good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./mt-dgemm 4000 | <span>grep </span>GF    
GFLOP/s rate:         382.756063 GF/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick inspection with <code>perf</code> shows that most cycles are spent
in a Zen-optimized kernel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>79.95%  mt-dgemm  libmkl_def.so           [.] mkl_blas_def_dgemm_kernel_zen
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bad-news-sgemm-is-not-yet-implemented">Bad news: <code>sgemm</code> is not yet implemented</h2>

<p>However, it seems that they have not yet implemented Zen kernels
for every BLAS function yet. I modified the ACES benchmark to
use the <code>sgemm</code> BLAS function and the results aren’t quite as
good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./mt-sgemm 4000 | <span>grep </span>GF
GFLOP/s rate:         237.352720 GF/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And indeed, <code>perf</code> reveals that MKL does not use a Zen kernel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>88.90%  mt-sgemm  libmkl_def.so           [.] LM_LOOPgas_1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="a-temporary-workaround">A temporary workaround</h2>

<p>Some quick tracing shows that MKL uses a single function
<code>mkl_serv_intel_cpu_true</code> to detect whether it is dealing
with a genuine Intel CPU. Fortunately, the function is
rather trivial, so we can replace it by our own function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>mkl_serv_intel_cpu_true</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And compile it as a shared library:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-shared</span> <span>-fPIC</span> <span>-o</span> libfakeintel.so fakeintel.c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And ensure that the library gets preloaded:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LD_PRELOAD</span><span>=</span>libfakeintel.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the <code>sgemm</code> benchmark shows good performance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./mt-sgemm 4000 | <span>grep </span>GF
GFLOP/s rate:         851.541946 GF/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And indeed, an AVX2-optimized code path is used:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>82.73%  mt-sgemm  libmkl_avx2.so          [.] mkl_blas_avx2_sgemm_kernel_0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only minor downside is that MKL will also use AVX2 kernels for
other functions such as <code>dgemm</code>. But this does not seem to impact
performance negatively. In fact, for the <code>dgemm</code> benchmark performance
is slightly better on my machine (430 GF/s).</p>

<h2 id="making-it-permanent">Making it permanent</h2>

<p>Setting <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> everytime on a machine can get weary and one can
easily forget it. An easy solution is to add our small library to the
ELF dynamic section of your program using
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> with the <code>DT_NEEDED</code>
tag. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>patchelf <span>--add-needed</span> libfakeintel.so yourbinary
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="856" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-1024x856.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-1024x856.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-300x251.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-768x642.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-1070x894.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform.jpg 1449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>Most technology companies above a certain size start thinking about creating an internal platform team to build/manage systems that are used by multiple teams/products. This is a very high leverage team since they can beneficially impact many products at once and super-charge the organization. However, today I want to put some things that do not work well with internal platform teams, at least in the versions that I have encountered.</p>
<p>Tl;dr – It is better to operate multiple platform teams specializing in their own techno-business domains than to operate a single platform team. <a href="https://kislayverma.com/category/platform-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Platform Thinking</a> is not about reuse, it is about facilitating evolution, and fixating on reuse destroys that opportunity. Instil platform thinking in all teams and allow self-reliant domains and platforms to emerge organically instead of forcing the issue up front.</p>
<p><strong>What does this team do?</strong></p>
<p>Having a separate platforms team often means that all horizontal concerns start getting pushed to them. Eventually, this team cannot identify its customers and simply ends up supporting many useful but disjoint systems. It is difficult to set goals and a north star for such a company because they are decoupled from the end user “by definition”. The only intent of such a team is to maximize the reuse of systems within an organization without any regard to the purposes of those systems and the expertise needed to run those systems.</p>
<p>In worse situations, other teams have no qualms building reusable components. But when it comes to supporting the reuse in production, respecting SLO and SLAs with other teams, people immediately start looking for a platform team to dump the operations on. The result is an operations laden central team forever doing firefighting because of its poor understanding of what it owns.</p>
<p>As the number of shared use-cases in a company grows, the platform team becomes the repository of all kinds of unconnected components whose business purpose they are disconnected from. Eventually we end up with a “team” whose team members have no idea what the others are working on as each member ends up specializing in some part or the other. We get technical specialists but not subject matter experts in the topics that most impact the business. If business starts to get into trouble, the platform team and its work is often among the first to go on the chopping block. This is because it is very difficult to explain to business how this collection of quasi-experts will help them make money.</p>
<p><strong>The developer gold rush</strong></p>
<p>There is something fundamentally unsound about the popular two-dimensional view of an organization’s technical stack. It biases us to the idea that things at the bottom are more foundational in nature, or more complex. It is certainly true that lower layers support more “scale” than upper layers. All of these things cause developers to rush to join the internal platform team as soon as it is incubated. The work is seen as more prestigious or more central, in some way, to the organization. The fact is that at best it is more technical in nature so developers don’t have to deal with the messiness of the real world, customer facing products.</p>
<p>This represents an organizational challenge in multiple ways. One is just managing who gets to do what and which roles are considered cool (why aren’t non-platform roles considered “business features“ and not “awesome engineering”). The other part is managing expectations in the team that eventually does get formed, Creating the team is easy, but keeping them business/customer focussed is harder than expected. Some many platform teams are mired in a strange mix of technical arrogance and customer detachment, making them far less powerful than they can be.</p>
<p><strong>Other teams aren’t platform teams?</strong></p>
<p>If there is a platform team, then does it mean that other teams aren’t platform teams? With a catch-all team in place, other teams start abandoning platform thinking and start thinking in product silos.</p>
<p>If platformization has value, then it should be the mindset and strategy for all teams and not the domain on one single team. Since all business problems are made up of <a href="https://kislayverma.com/platform-thinking/platforms-and-dogfood-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">domain and organization context</a>, it stands to reason that all teams should be producing and operating platformized components. These platforms may be produced on top of others which are owned by other teams. The purpose of a platform or a generic product is not just reuse, but also to model a domain boundary where organizational expertise is centralized. The platform team cannot keep pulling in horizontal components wherever they arise because then they would have to be experts in all aspects of the business. The typical definition of a platform team which owns a bottom tier of reusable things is just not compatible with the way organizations work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that leads us to…</p>

<p><strong>Lines of ownership</strong></p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1022" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1024x1022.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1024x1022.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-300x300.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-768x766.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1070x1068.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack.jpg 1494w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The tech stack of a company can be visualized with higher order system abstractions at the top and lower ones at the bottom. Which means that the skill set of operating the architecture can vary substantially as you go down the stack. This gives credence to the idea that the lower layers are somehow “different” from the upper layer and should be managed differently.</p>
<p>When we look at the technical stack, how should the lines of ownership run? Should they run horizontally, along components of similar level of abstraction, or should they run vertically, grouping systems generating end-to-end business value?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running an autonomous, cross functional team (and many many companies claim to do so), does the depth of the stack matter? The very premise of this team is to be able to work at all levels of the stack and in loose alignment with other teams at each level. In such a setup, the idea of a platform team with fixed horizontal charter is meaningless. Every team creates the layers of the platform that it requires, and shares them with others as needed. This keeps a low-overhead alignment process running because a component isn’t created only for reuse, it is created first for use and then gets reused as the need arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of ownership also solves the problem of orphaned components which everyone critically depends upon but no one team maintains. Open sourcing is a great idea for writing code but a terrible idea for operations. Software MUST have an operational owner – one team that is responsible for ensuring that it is running as it is supposed to and meeting the benchmarks it is supposed to. Autonomous teams operate what they build, and if we can teach them to build platforms, then we don’t need to explicitly create platform teams.</p>
<hr>
<p>But with that said, One of the big arguments against autonomous teams is that they often end up doing a bunch of repeated work. This is obviously suboptimal, so how can we minimize this.</p>
<p><strong>Solving the reuse problem</strong></p>
<p>This problem can be minimized by having <em>all</em> problems solved in a platformized manner such that once invented, all teams can benefit from the systems that emerge. There might be short term problems in aligning around launch dates and such, but in the longer run, all use cases of a certain capability or entity start getting centralized in one place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the team which built this platform doesn’t own it anymore. Reuse does not mean separating ownership from creation. A well designed platform is designed to keep the platform team out of the client’s decision cycle (external programmability), so if a notification platform is built by the marketing team and adopted by many others, the marketing team can continue to own and operate it – nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Once a reusable thing finds more than 3 customer (Atwood’s law), then it <strong><em>may</em></strong> be time to consider this a horizontal responsibility and move it to a separate team. I don’t say move it to a general purpose platform team, but to a specific team that can specialize in the domain modelled by the component and can commit to evolving it to the benefit of all its customers. E.g. A notifications system can kick-start a new business domain altogether – a little Twilio in its own right. Or it may be only a shared technical capability like Managed Elasticsearch which can be handled by a team of storage/elasticsearch experts in the storage platform team/ES platform team.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="923" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1024x923.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1024x923.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-300x270.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-768x692.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1536x1384.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born-1070x964.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-new-domain-is-born.jpg 1638w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The above example shows that new teams and domains can be spawned off from every team’s work at either the same level of abstraction if the team originally owns all levels of abstraction in its work (aka a full-stack team). A new domain is a whole new reusable component in a sense. We grow the organization vertically by <a href="https://kislayverma.com/software-architecture/layering-domains-and-microservices-using-api-gateways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layering components</a>, and the layers are built creating reusable components atop each other. We also grow the organization horizontally by adding whole new problem spaces that need solving, and each of these will in turn new opportunities for deepening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This organic process goes against the idea of a fixed, co-located platform charter. The idea of a “platform team” confuses the idea of ownership and reuse just as it confuses the idea of “depth” of the platform in the stack with domain knowledge. I think it is far better to think in terms of teams in specific domains each developing their own platforms, and moving cross teams and merging as either redundancy or reuse is discovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my mind, the only platform teams on day one are the infra team (managing the hardware stuff) and perhaps the authentication/authorization team, and even these I think of business/tech capabilities rather than reuse/depth-in-the-stack driven teams. All other platforms should emerge from inside product teams. Think cellular division rather than divine hand.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to get better at something, it’s important to do that thing.</strong></p>



<p>Sounds almost too obvious, yet we frequently find ways to rationalize inaction. One of the most common excuses is that we don’t know enough to start. We tell ourselves that we’ll start doing after we’ve learned more. Just one more book or course.<sup data-mfn="1">1</sup><span data-mfn="1">Some <a href="https://personalityjunkie.com/12/intp-intj-enneagram-5-types-dont-feel-ready-to-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">personality types</a> may be more susceptible to this pitfall.</span></p>



<p>What makes this excuse so insidious is that the <strong>best way to learn is precisely by doing</strong>. To do is to interact with reality. Reality provides feedback in a way that your mind cannot.</p>



<blockquote><p>Experience: that most brutal of teachers. But you learn, my God do you learn.</p><cite>C.S. Lewis</cite></blockquote>



<p>“It was overseasoned,” I said to myself after taking a bite of today’s omelette. Perhaps I could’ve avoided that mistake had I studied more cookbooks. But what do cookbooks tell you? Use “a pinch” of something? What is a pinch? Good cooks will say, “Oh, you just know.” How do you know? <strong>Through doing</strong>.</p>



<p>When we do something (cook an omelette), feedback identifies what we did well (omelette is edible, kitchen didn’t burn down) and what we did poorly (omelette is overseasoned). Improvement occurs when we incorporate reality’s feedback into future actions (use less seasoning, hold everything else constant). Maybe next time, the omelette is too bland. I would then incorporate that feedback into my third attempt. This is known as a feedback loop.</p>



<p>Feedback loops are the reason why consistent doing is the key to improvement. Do thing, see result, incorporate result, see new result, rinse and repeat.</p>



<p>As long as serious injury isn’t at risk, it is never too early to start doing. If taking action is daunting, start small. Even the smallest of actions is infinitely better than no action at all. You can become a better reader by reading, but you won’t improve at the thing you were reading about unless you do it.</p>



<p>A reader pointed out that the C.S. Lewis quote is a misattribution. <a href="https://www.cslewis.com/surprised-by-misquotes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Upon further digging</a>, I discovered that the quote is actually a line in the 1993 British biographical drama Shadowlands. It’s spoken by Anthony Hopkins, who played C.S. Lewis.</p>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>A review of Baumann et.als paper on limitations of the fork system call present in UNIX operating systems.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf">Baumann, Andrew, et al. “A fork () in the road.” <em>Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems</em>. 2019</a>.</p>

<p>This is a paper that only affects a small number of people: those doing OS research and those that directly call <code>fork</code> from their programs. Still, I find it interesting since it points to limitations in the UNIX design. When I learned to program, UNIX was seen as the gold standard. I remember reading an LKML post from Linus Torvalds where he meant that OS development was about the refinement of existing ideas, not so much about inventing new concepts.  But people still do OS research, and the paper describes how having to support <code>fork</code> can be a burden.</p>

<p>The main criticism in the paper is about how <code>fork</code> affects many other parts of the system. It was originally a very simple idea: copy the address space of the parent and let the child redirect file descriptors, reduce permissions or, alter the namespace of the child.  But <code>fork</code> today impacts all other operating system abstractions with which it was once orthogonal. Below are some practical examples of things mentioned in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="buffered-io-and-fork">Buffered I/O and Fork</h2>

<p>What do you think this program will print?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World! ");
    pid_t pid = fork();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It prints the output twice, <code>Hello World! Hello World!</code>, since the stdio buffers are flushed both in the parent and in the child. So  in this case <code>fork</code> doesn’t compose, since the calling code needs to explicitly flush I/O before calling <code>fork</code>.</p>

<h2 id="threads-and-fork">Threads and Fork</h2>

<p>This program starts a thread that locks a mutex for 1ms. It then forks a child which tries to lock the same mutex. What do you think it will print and why?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;

static pthread_mutex_t thread_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

static void* worker(void* arg) {
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());

    for (;;) {
      pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;thread_mutex);
      usleep(1000);
      pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;thread_mutex);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, worker, 0);

    usleep(1000);
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;thread_mutex);
        const char buf[] = "lock acquired\n";
        write(fileno(stderr), buf, strlen(buf));
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;thread_mutex);
        exit(0);
    }

    wait3(NULL, WNOHANG, NULL);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On my system, the subprocess always deadlocks before printing the <code>lock acquired</code> message. A child created by <code>fork</code> has only a single thread (a copy of the calling thread). So there’s a good chance that the mutex will be in the locked state when the child starts executing. One common case where this happens is if a thread doing memory allocation and holding a heap lock, while <code>fork </code>is called.</p>

<h2 id="large-address-spaces-and-fork">Large address spaces and Fork</h2>

<p>How long do you think it takes to fork if the parent has 10K VMAs? Here’s a test program from Chromes <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819228">Issue 819228: Consider using posix_spawn() on Linux</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* Allocates several memory ranges and reports how long it takes to fork().
 *
 * clang slow_fork.c -o slow_fork &amp;&amp; ./slow_fork 100 10
 *
 * Almost no error checking anywhere.
 */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
#define SIZE 100 * PAGE_SIZE

void* mmap_anonymous(size_t size) {
  return mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
              MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
}

void** create_vmas(int count) {
  void** result = (void**) calloc(count, sizeof(void*));
  if (!result)
    return NULL;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    result[i] = mmap_anonymous(SIZE);
    if (!result[i])
      return NULL;
  }
  return result;
}

void remove_vmas(void** arrays, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    munmap(arrays[i], SIZE);
  }
  free(arrays);
}

void memset_all(void** arrays, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    memset(arrays[i], 0, SIZE);
  }
}

struct timespec now() {
  struct timespec now;
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;now);
  return now;
}

long interval_ns(struct timespec tick, struct timespec tock) {
  return (tock.tv_sec - tick.tv_sec) * 1000000000L
      + (tock.tv_nsec - tick.tv_nsec);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int vmas, iterations;
  void** areas;
  struct timespec tick, tock;

  if (argc != 3) {
    printf("Usage: %s &lt;nb_vmas&gt; &lt;iterations&gt;\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  vmas = atoi(argv[1]);
  iterations = atoi(argv[2]);

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++) {
    areas = create_vmas(vmas);
    if (!areas)
      return 1;

    memset_all(areas, vmas);

    tick = now();
    if (fork()) {
      // parent.
      tock = now();
      long ns = interval_ns(tick, tock);
      printf("%.2fus to fork().\n", (double) ns / 1e3);
    } else {
      _exit(0);
    }
    remove_vmas(areas, vmas);
  }

  return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On my system, here are the run-times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./fork 1 1
149.65us to fork().
$ ./fork 10 
89.63us to fork().
$ ./fork 100 1
576.18us to fork().
$ ./fork 1000 1
2661.38us to fork().
$ ./fork 10000 1
35420.67us to fork().
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So 35ms to <code>fork</code> with 10K VMAs. If I replace the <code>fork</code> call with <code>vfork</code> it takes only 115us! The speed difference is because <code>fork</code> needs to copy the page table entries to the new address space.</p>

<p>To get around these limitations some systems mark memory-mapped regions as not to be forked. Others like Chrome creates  a zygote process that has as little memory allocated as possible to ensure fast process creation times.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-fork">Alternatives to Fork</h2>

<p>You can use <code>vfork</code>  or <code>posix_spawn</code> instead. The <code>vfork</code> function creates a new process but does not copy the parent’s page tables. Instead, it starts the child in the same address space as its parent and starts it  before the parent. The only thing that can be done from there is calling èxec<code>. The </code>posix_spawn<code> API is much more complicated than just calling </code> <code>fork</code>, but as we’ve seen the simplicity comes with a great burden on modern systems.</p>

            <h2>A Bit of Background</h2>
            <p>
                I recently encountered a fun little padding oracle attack as part of a CTF and found surprisingly few articles online outlining the attack. Of the articles I did find, most either discussed specific instances of the attack (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE</a>) or described a lengthy sequence of mathematical operations which were difficult to follow. In this post I want to present a different, more visual description of the attack in the hope that some may find it useful and easier to understand.
            </p>

            <h2>Cipher Modes</h2>
            <p>
                Before talking about padding oracles, we need to talk about cipher modes and block ciphers. The cipher we will be using in our examples is the Rijndael block cipher which forms part of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). A block cipher is an algorithm which operates on fixed-length groups of bits (blocks). Contrast this with a stream cipher where each bit is encrypted one at a time. As a block cipher is only suitable for a single fixed-length message, additional steps are required to encrypt or decrypt messages longer (or shorter) than one block. A cipher mode algorithm describes how to apply the single-block operation repeatedly to securely encrypt or decrypt a message larger than a single block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Padding oracles are commonly associated with block ciphers operating in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. In CBC mode each block of plaintext is mixed with the previous block before encryption. This prevents information leakage associated with the simpler Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode. In ECB mode each block is encrypted with the same key and so the same plaintext is always encrypted to the same ciphertext. This means patterns present in the plaintext will likely still be present in the ciphertext. We can see this in the images below comparing ECB and CBC modes.

            <h2>AES Encryption</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we understand the different encryption modes we can begin exploring how a message is encrypted and then onto the decryption stage where our padding oracle will enable us to decrypt the message without knowing the key.
            </p>
            <svg id="animation-1" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 600 340"></svg>
            
            
            
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Padding Oracles</h2>
            <p>
                Onto the padding oracle. The decryption process for CBC mode ciphers is to decrypt all blocks, validate and remove the padding then return the plaintext. How the server responds based on invalid padding will determine whether or not we can perform the attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                A padding oracle attack exploits the padding validation step of decryption in order to decrypt the message without knowing the key. The attack relies on having a padding oracle which reveals whether or not a message is correctly padded. Typically this will be the decryption server responding with a verbose error message indicating the padding is invalid. However, other channels are also possible. For example a server may take longer to reply if a message is incorrectly padded, as long as it can be inferred whether or not a message is correctly padded the attack can be performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we know what we’re looking for in a padding oracle we can walk through the decryption of our message and perform a padding oracle attack.
            </p>
            <svg id="animation-2" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 600 340"></svg>
            
            
            
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Mitigations</h2>
            <p>
                So what can we do to prevent this attack? The obvious fix is to not reveal whether or not a message is correctly padded. However, this is easier said than done. Providing a generic error if a message fails to decrypt will eliminate any obvious padding oracles. But timing-based padding oracles are much harder to detect and prevent. In a timing-based padding oracle, rather than an error message indicating invalid padding a server may take a noticibly different amount of time to process a correctly padded message from an incorrectly padded message. How long it takes the server to respond can then be used to determine if a message is correctly padded or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                A much better approach is to encrypt the message and then append a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to verify the integrity of the ciphertext. The MAC is then validated by the server before any decryption occurs. If the validation fails, it indicates the message has been tampered with. The server can then refuse to continue decrypting the message. This ensures that there is no padding oracle, regardless of implementation details such as timings and error messages.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Hopefully this has helped explain padding oracles a little better. As well as illustrate how important it is to understand how to correctly implement cryptographic code as one small mistake can very quickly bring it tumbling down. An interesting takeaway is that this technique is not just limited to decryption. Padding oracles can also be exploited to forge valid ciphertext without knowing the key, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. If you ever see a system which assumes that an encrypted value cannot be tampered with (session tokens are good ones), don't forget to check for padding oracles.

<h2 id="hack-2-disable-your-self-view">Hack #2: Disable your self-view</h2>

<p>Change your video settings to disable your “self-view”. This keeps your video on for others, but not for yourself.</p>

<p>Part of what makes video conferences exhausting is the unconscious part of your brain continually self-monitoring your own image for appropriateness. This unnaturally raises your self-consciousness because you normally don’t see your own face during in-person socializing; imagine always looking at yourself in a mirror when talking to someone face-to-face. Disabling your self-view helps avoid unnecessarily tiring out your social muscles.</p>

<p>Here are direct links to instructions on how to disable self-view:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Zoom</strong>: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001077226-Hiding-or-showing-my-video-on-my-display" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hide my video on my display</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Google Meet/Hangouts</strong>: <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9292748" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turn off self view in a video call</a>. Unfortunately Meet still shows a “preview” video even when self-view is disabled, but you can adblock it.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Webex</strong>: This is not currently possible but you can change your self-view to PiP and <a href="https://help.webex.com/en-us/6895sz/Access-and-Adjust-Self-View-on-Room-and-Desk-Devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point the camera away</a> from you. Another option is to cover the image of yourself on your screen with a post-it note.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Skype</strong>: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/hide-thumbnail-video-of-myself/467d3a49-8e84-48b4-865c-7a114a7422d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not possible</a> but you can cover that part of a screen with a post-it.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Slack</strong>: Also not possible but again a sticky note comes to the rescue.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hack-3-take-calls-in-creative-places">Hack #3: Take calls in creative places</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3b9b5de5e28e3e4e7d97dd827f32ec73b0b86368/c3968/assets/blog/img/zoom_hacks-shower.jpg" alt="A video call where I'm in the shower, but the background looks like a tile wall."></p>

<p>With the right camera angle, you can’t even tell that I’m in the shower. It just looks like I’m seated at a fancy café with marble walls.</p>
<!-- Kramdown -->

<p>If you can, occasionally go to a different room from where you normally take your calls/do your work to attend different video calls. I think environmental cues are important and going to a different room from where you normally “work” will subconsciously convince you that this event is different from others you’ve experienced. This will reduce fatigue hopping from call to call if your entire day is full of video calls, and helps prevent the day from dissolving into an unmemorable blur where you feel like you accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>Take your calls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>on your front porch</li>
  <li>in your hallway</li>
  <li>at a public park</li>
  <li>in your car (not while driving)</li>
  <li>in your basement</li>
  <li>in your shower (please leave clothes on and leave water off)</li>
  <li>any other creative location you can think of</li>
</ul>

<p>Use a virtual background if you don’t like how your attic looks on camera. If your videoconferencing software does not support virtual backgrounds, or it can’t detect your wall, you can buy a vinyl wall sticker to easily change your background to look like <a href="https://amzn.to/32Rkl19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3juHTQ3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/32Ew8zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile</a> (<a href="https://billmei.net/disclosure">affiliate link info</a>).</p>

<p>If you live in a tiny one room apartment, you can move furniture around to create a different “room”. For example, I sometimes push my desk away from the wall and then sit on the opposite side of the desk to take calls facing the other direction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nate Munk is a software engineer from Detroit who is turning his hobby of creating voice apps into a business making over $1,000 a month. Hear his journey of how he discovered Alexa Skills and what he went through until successfully finding a niche.</p></div></div><div><div><h4><strong>Name:</strong> Nate Munk</h4><h4><strong>Location:</strong> Detroit, USA</h4><h4><strong>What I Do:</strong> Software Engineer<br></h4><h3>What's your background, how did you get started in voice and what are you currently working on?</h3><p>Right now I'm a software engineer at Ford Motor Company. I got my degree in Information Systems from Brigham Young University and I didn't have a lot of programming experience in school. I focused more on the business process aspect. During my last year at school, I had the opportunity to be in a mobile app competition that the school was hosting, and I asked them if I could make an Alexa skill. That was almost four years ago, and something that I hadn't even really looked into before, but I was interested in learning more about it. So, I created a game called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nate-Munk-Escape-Jurassic-Island/dp/B074CQW8H4">Escape Jurassic Island</a>. I've since redone it a couple of times and it's in Voiceflow now but I originally just coded it out and ended up taking second place in the competition and won a couple thousand bucks which was nice. It was enough of an incentive and made me feel like maybe I could even make a little bit of money doing this while enjoying the experience. That was kind of how I initially got started.</p><figure id="w-node-27d3eb5d7ff6-fd124adf"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ec74e25528af04410124ad1/5ec834a106d25c66260a545d_1588953809273.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Fast forward to today and I have almost 40 skills that are live. A majority of these are white noise skills, and that's where my attention has mostly been recently. I started building a bunch of different games and it was difficult to monetize those, so I started looking at other options and I believe it was in October when I started building some white noise skills.</p><h3>It looks like your Jurassic Island skill is pretty popular. Has that been difficult to monetize too or is there something that you did differently with it that made it easier?</h3><p>That one has been pretty difficult to monetize. I'll get maybe a couple of sales with in-skill purchasing (ISP) every month. It's just a few bucks here and there. I was in the weekly Amazon email newsletter in July or August which helped that skill get pushed out to a ton of people all at once and I was able to make a couple hundred bucks from the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/grow-your-business/rewards">Developer Rewards Program</a> based on the engagement my skill got and I also made a few sales. But since then it's been pretty slow. And then with most of my other game skills I get a fair amount of usage but not a lot of purchases right now.</p><h3>For your white noise skills what goes into making them? Do you record the audio yourself?</h3><p>I've done a mix of recording my own audio just with my mic that I have at home and then spending a lot of time in <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">audacity</a> making some minor tweaks to it. I edit it and generate a really long file that doesn't have anything that sounds bad. It should sound like it's one continuous audio file. And then some audio is just <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">creative commons zero</a> (CC0) which is free audio that can be used commercially. When using that approach I spend a bit of time searching for what I want, make tweaks to it, and then create the different audio files. Right now I'm hosting a lot of them on<a href="https://soundcloud.com/"> SoundCloud</a> and then some in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>. Both allow me to generate URLs to the audio that I can point to in my skills.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ec74e25528af04410124ad1/5ec84915d0fb9b2456a05804_relaxing-sleep-sounds.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>What's been the most challenging part of building skills that you've had to overcome?</h3><p>I'd say this applies more towards the white noise skills, but the changing landscape for monetization was a pretty big hurdle. I created all of my skills and was initially trying to monetize them through usage (<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/grow-your-business/rewards">Alexa Developer Rewards</a>). I made all of my skills provide longer audio files so they run longer before they need to loop in my free version which was more than what you could get with other skills’ paid versions. I was just trying to build something that was better than existing skills and that was free with the hope it would start to attract enough users for Amazon to pay me for usage. But over the last several months they've been paying out a lot less than before and I'm not sure exactly what the criteria is that goes into that.</p><p>I learned pretty quickly that relying solely on developer rewards wasn't going to be a very good way to monetize my skills. I had to do a pivot where I had these skills that were playing five hour plus audio files while the other guys had four hour files but you're paying $2 a month for that. And so I had to find a way to make my skills enticing enough where I didn't have to change my free version and I could provide enough value on a paid version for people to want to make that jump. That ended up being a big challenge. It’s something that took a little while to figure out, but I started offering 12 hour audio files. With 12 hours it’s basically guaranteed to play through the whole night without having to go in and out and disrupt your sleep. Then I added a new feature that I have on almost all of my white noise skills that will play your chosen white noise sound but then it will transition into a more peaceful sound. So when it's time to wake up it'll be like birds chirping or something that's just nice to wake up to.</p><p>Since getting those two features added for my paid content, I'm getting close to about 3% of people that sign up for a free trial which is pretty good. At least I assume it's pretty good. I've gotten a pretty good number of users. I think I've had maybe 800-900 people total who have signed up for free trials and a number of them drop off, but I’m still retaining a good number of people. So it's been growing each month and I've been able to make more than the previous month fairly significantly.</p><h3>How do you promote your Alexa Skills and help them get discovered? Is there anything that you've found to be helpful In particular?</h3><p>That is probably actually the most difficult part because I have no idea how to really market my skills effectively. I had a little bit of a lucky break with one of my skills because it just organically was getting traffic. It had a good invocation name that people were able to say easily and remember and that started driving a lot of traffic. It ended up being sustained for quite awhile but that particular skill has started to slow down. However, I think the increased traffic and reviews and different things that I obtained helped to elevate my ranking for the skills that came after it.</p><p>So, I haven't done any marketing. I haven't spent any money to try to get my skills out there. I just recently created a website. I threw together a splash page that gives a little bit of information and it has links to my skills and I'm looking at different ways to drive traffic like reaching out to bloggers. But overall, my marketing plan has mostly been relying on a little bit of luck and it's been working okay so far.</p><h3>What's been the most useful resource or tool for you in learning about creating voice apps and making them successful?</h3><p>I like to read articles to stay caught up on new developments and learn from what other people are doing. I think the biggest thing that I've learned, and it's been kind of a frustrating thing to learn, is I just made mistakes over and over again. A lot of them get caught before they're public or released because Amazon catches a lot of them when I try to push out things that are not quite up to snuff but every once in a while it slips through and I hear back from a user. I feel like that's been the best way to learn for me - just getting feedback on things that I could do better. Learning and knowing the best practices going into it helps but I think knowing your user and their expectations of your skills has been the area where I've been able to succeed. Always remember to create something that gives the user what they want and provides the value that they're looking for.</p><blockquote><em>“I think the biggest thing that I've learned, and it's been kind of a frustrating thing to learn, is I just made mistakes over and over again.”</em></blockquote><h3>What are your goals for 2020?</h3><p>I have a pretty extensive spreadsheet of goals around the number of new users, new signups for subscriptions, the amount of money that I want to make, retention, etc. But the underlying factor with those is just seeing a steady increase in the number of people that I am able to reach and the number of users who think it's worth it to upgrade and be willing to pay for my skills. So from a numbers perspective, those are the things that I'm looking for. From a qualitative approach, I love hearing back from my users. Whether it's a review or an email or they just reach out to me and say, “the skill has worked really well. It's helped me to sleep better and it's helped my kid to sleep better.” It's harder to quantify but knowing that the skills that I'm creating are making a difference and making people's lives better..that's something that's impactful. It's hard to get passionate about white noise but that makes it a lot easier to continue focusing on it and to improve the skills that I have as well as work towards creating new ones.</p><blockquote><em>“It's harder to quantify but knowing that the skills that I'm creating are making a difference and making people's lives better...that's something that's impactful.”</em></blockquote><h3>Do you have any advice for someone who's new and just getting started?</h3><p>I would say the biggest thing is - don't be afraid to fail. I've been doing this for about four years and have only really started to monetize my apps well over the last six months. It's something that takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of effort. But when you really put yourself out there and try to do things that are outside of your comfort zone you're probably gonna fail quite a few times before you're successful. That's just part of the process of getting to where you want to be. It was hard for me to push through to get to this point but it's definitely worth it, especially if it's something that you're passionate about.</p><p>The questions that have been posted here on Voice Devs that have been driving community …</p></div></div></div>

<p>A hundred years ago, a person could not imagine to be able to play any musical instrument they want, to create new interactive worlds, or to launch cars into space.
Life was simply not enough.</p>
<p>Then the machines came.
Silicon computations allowed us, mere mortals, prolong our lives virtually and literally.</p>
<p>Music creation software, game development engines, 2D and 3D editors, neural networks, AI and machine learning, motion capturing, navigation, medicine, wearable devices, smartphones…
Thanks to these, a person now can do a lot of things while having more free time during their lifespan.</p>
<p>It all happened because a human learned to communicate with machines with means of programming languages.
Early inventors of the future were brilliant people able to coin fundamentally new concepts which last until today.</p>
<p>But this is the how the humanity evolves: we accumulate knowledge and pack, shortcut it.
We don’t need to keep in head proofs of every mathematical theorem, and we don’t need to fully understand the nature of an axiom.
Instead, we store theorem and axiom statements.
With that in mind, we have more space to solve new problems.</p>
<p>The same applies to programming.
Those brilliant people inevitably become old, as real system programming knowledge fades away.
On the surface, the amount of those who really understand how machines work seems to shrink.</p>

<p>“But I can run a newural network with Python!”, one would argue.
Well, who do you think develops TensorFlow itself?
TensorFlow <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">isn’t written in Python</a>, kid.</p>
<p>Writing a game in Lua or Ruby is totally possible, as well as creating a messenger or code editor in Electron.
However, Electron, as any mature game engines, are still written in <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron">C++</a>.</p>
<p>Almost any meaningful software which needs to utilize a machine with more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">20%</a> efficiency, is written in a system programming language.</p>
<p>System programming is the foundation of the development of the human civilization.</p>
<p>Regardless of its importance, system programming seems to be less popular than application programming, because it’s known to be harder to both learn and master.
It is definitely easier to spin up a web server, connect it to a database, set up some Stripe integration, drink a smoothie and proudly call yourself an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>But that does not invest in the human civilization’s progress on the Kardashov’s scale.
<mark>The humanity will still depend on system programming in the foreseeable future.</mark>
And we need new, fresh blood there.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll try to take a peek on the current state of the system programming, find out why it’s not that popular and choose the best system programming language for the Next Big But Fairly-Low-Level Project ™.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-language">Choosing the Right Language <a href="#choosing-the-right-language">¶</a></h2>
<p>When choosing a serious language for serious system programming, the choice is broad: it’s either C, C++, Rust, or one of the many new LLVM-based projects.</p>
<h3 id="c">C <a href="#c">¶</a></h3>
<p>C is excellent at its simplicity, but bigger projects require higher-level language features, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/jfbastien/status/1289305925199650816">memory control</a>, object hierarchy, lambdas etc.; therefore, C is out of competition here.</p>
<p>Ditto applies to C “replacements”, such as <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Ẕ̴̰̥̔͝i̷̥̣̍̓̉ġ̷̢̪͌̾́</a> and <a href="https://vlang.io/">Patreon-lang</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c%2B%2B">C++ <a href="#c%2B%2B">¶</a></h3>
<p>C++ is the grandfather of higher-level system programming.</p>
<p>It offers powerful features with a grain of Unix epoch practices and a great amount of undefined behaviour.
Funnily enough, an experienced C++ programmer shall aware of not what C++ is, but of what it is not, i.e. undefined behaviour of the language.</p>
<p>That said, developing on C++ is pain, and it is easy to shoot your lower parts off by, say, returning a lambda with a closured local variable.
Of course, it is possible to have a fancy third-party UB checking tool, but such a tool would never be perfect considering the amount of UB in the language itself.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/04da42cb9f4d387184dff020f9e3165db0f6c6b3/4e4e4/public/img/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/thinking-about-meme.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><figcaption>Relatable AF</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another Unix anachronism C++ inherits is the backwards compatibility with a bitter taste of Postel’s law: “most compilers implement that feature in different ways, let’s put it into the language after a short thought with design averaging from existing implementations!”.
One may argue that backwards compatibility is a good thing, but let me postpone this discussion for a <a href="#backwards-compatibility">later section</a> of this article.</p>
<h3 id="rust%2C-pt.-1">Rust, pt. 1 <a href="#rust%2C-pt.-1">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rust is a fairly young programming language with a reputable mission: empower everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
Let’s deconstruct the statement.</p>
<p>One of the game-changing features of Rust is the separation between safe and unsafe code.
The ability to isolate volatile code worths a lot: if anything goes wrong, then you simply <code>grep</code> your codebase with <code>unsafe</code> filter and voilà – all the dangerous invocations are at your hand sight.
It also allows <em>the</em> implementation to perform crazy optimizations, say, by entirely removing parts of code; and it’s fine because there is no unsafe access to that code.
As a result, focusing on volatile code becomes easier, and nasty bugs are squashed faster.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <em>the</em> Rust compiler would yell at you, pointing at your mistakes in the safe code area.
And those yells are detailed enough, so most of the time you have a clear picture on why you’re wrong and what to do with that.</p>
<p>Compared to C++, Rust compilation process is much friendlier and catches more bugs before you face them in runtime.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b725e860ee4af6ccc10b35afdeae8392958e28b/1756b/public/img/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/errors-in-langs.jpg" alt="" title="How different compilers react to user errors" width="100%"><figcaption>I just wanted to sort an array</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another good thing about Rust is macros.
Well, what’s good is the idea of macros; the implementation of macros in Rust is um… questionable.
Nevertheless, macros allow writing code in code with much greater flexibility than with C++ preprocessor and constant expressions.
Nuff said, macros are must-have in modern languages.</p>
<p>The built-in crates system Rust has brings powerful abstractions into the ecosystem.
Those folks enjoying lower-level programming and having enough skills to do so can wrap unsafe, but performant code, into simple, but safe abstractions.
And those who have a need to just make things work, may (comparably) <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/21/rust_actix_web_framework_maintainer_quits/">easy adopt those crates</a>.</p>
<hr>
<!-- ![Checkpoint!](../../../public/img/posts/2020-08-16-system-programming-in-2k20/checkpoint.svg =100%x) -->
<p>Rust really does allow to build <em>reliable</em> (no undefined behaviour in-the-wild) and <em>efficient</em> (thanks to the zero-cost philosophy) software to <em>everyone</em> (with powerful abstractions).</p>
<p>But, there are always some “but<sub>t</sub>s”.</p>
<p>First of all, only a few may say Rust has friendly syntax.
In the maniacal pursuit for the absolute memory safety, the language introduces plethora of abstractions such as borrow checker, six string types (hey, we’re making a language here, not a guitar), <code>Mut</code>, <code>Box</code>, <code>Arc</code>, <code>Trait</code>, requiring to do those ubiquitous <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>as_ref()</code> and <code>borrow()</code> (often chained) literally before every access.</p>
<p>Some may call it “hipster thinking”, but those small spikes like mandatory semicolons*, curly brackets wrapping, and otherwise unintuitive design decisions like constantly “screaming code” with ubiquitous bangs (<code>!</code>) and overloaded documentation semantics — they make writing and reading Rust code harder.
Definitely harder than Ruby or, say,
J̸̧̨̹͈̦̏̅͒̈́͂͐̄̾͟͟ͅȃ̡͎̯̟̦͉͂͊̿̈́v̢̡͖͍̻̳̞͌͌̈̋̐͌̆͜a̴͖̱̟̩̹̘̺͊̃̋̇̾̀̀͐̊͐ͅS̶͚̣̥͚͈̥̤͔̾̎̎̿̔͊̋̉̓c̶̡̧̗̻̊̈̋̍̔̂̅̓̚͘͢ŗ̰͖̲̙͖͕̂̏̍͑̊̋ḯ̸̛̤̦̠͈̩̙̯̘̥̖̅́̊̀͑̕͠͠p̸̨̧̨̧̡̛̮̯͖̹͈̉̑̿͛̎̀͌̾͞ț̸̩͕͈̊͐̏̏̕͡ͅ

<div>
<p>* In fact, semicolons are not mandatory
<em>everywhere</em>
, which brings even more confusion.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26665471/are-semicolons-optional-in-rust">StackOverflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semicolons are generally not optional, but there are a few situations where they are. Namely after control expressions like <code>for</code>, <code>if/else</code>, <code>match</code>, etc.</p>

<div id="what-this-book-covers">
<h2>What this Book Covers<a href="#what-this-book-covers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book covers the building blocks of the most common methods in machine learning. This set of methods is like a toolbox for machine learning engineers. Those entering the field of machine learning should feel comfortable with this toolbox so they have the right tool for a variety of tasks. Each chapter in this book corresponds to a single machine learning method or group of methods. In other words, each chapter focuses on a single tool within the ML toolbox.</p>
<p>In my experience, the best way to become comfortable with these methods is to see them derived from scratch, both in theory and in code. The purpose of this book is to provide those derivations. Each chapter is broken into three sections. The <em>concept</em> sections introduce the methods conceptually and derive their results mathematically. The <em>construction</em> sections show how to construct the methods from scratch using Python. The <em>implementation</em> sections demonstrate how to apply the methods using packages in Python like <code><span>scikit-learn</span></code>, <code><span>statsmodels</span></code>, and <code><span>tensorflow</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-this-book">
<h2>Why this Book<a href="#why-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many great books on machine learning written by more knowledgeable authors and covering a broader range of topics. In particular, I would suggest <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">Elements of Statistical Learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a>, all of which are available online for free.</p>
<p>While those books provide a conceptual overview of machine learning and the theory behind its methods, this book focuses on the bare bones of machine learning algorithms. Its main purpose is to provide readers with the ability to construct these algorithms independently. Continuing the toolbox analogy, this book is intended as a user guide: it is not designed to teach users broad practices of the field but rather how each tool works at a micro level.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-this-book-is-for">
<h2>Who this Book is for<a href="#who-this-book-is-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book is for readers looking to learn new machine learning algorithms or understand algorithms at a deeper level. Specifically, it is intended for readers interested in seeing machine learning algorithms derived from start to finish. Seeing these derivations might help a reader previously unfamiliar with common algorithms understand how they work intuitively. Or, seeing these derivations might help a reader experienced in modeling understand how different algorithms create the models they do and the advantages and disadvantages of each one.</p>
<p>This book will be most helpful for those with practice in basic modeling. It does not review best practices—such as feature engineering or balancing response variables—or discuss in depth when certain models are more appropriate than others. Instead, it focuses on the elements of those models.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-readers-should-know">
<h2>What Readers Should Know<a href="#what-readers-should-know" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>concept</em> sections of this book primarily require knowledge of calculus, though some require an understanding of probability (think maximum likelihood and Bayes’ Rule) and basic linear algebra (think matrix operations and dot products). The appendix reviews the <a href="https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html"><span>math</span></a> and <a href="https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html"><span>probability</span></a>needed to understand this book. The concept sections also reference a few common machine learning <a href="https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html"><span>methods</span></a>, which are introduced in the appendix as well. The concept sections do not require any knowledge of programming.</p>
<p>The <em>construction</em> and <em>code</em> sections of this book use some basic Python. The construction sections require understanding of the corresponding content sections and familiarity creating functions and classes in Python. The code sections require neither.</p>

</section>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about writing lately. I recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left a career as a startup CTO to write full-time</a>, so when people ask me things like, “Why should software engineers know how to write?” I have a lot of thoughts. Rather than write yet another listicle (<a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/10/3/why-math-and-science-students-need-writing">1</a>, <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">2</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-developers-should-know-how-to-write-dc35aa9b71ab/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/developer-blog-writing-social-networks/">4</a>), I am going to boil it down to one simple reason:</p>
<p><strong>You should write to increase your level of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-influence-matters">Why Influence Matters</h2>
<p>Whether you strive to be promoted within your organization or be fawned over by the coolest tech companies, the fastest path to success is making the right people aware of you. In one of the best essays of career advice for programmers, Patrick McKenzie points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly. Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email.” - <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Patrick McKenzie, Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, just being the “best” programmer around isn’t going to get you talked about in a bar (and <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/good-computer-programmer-criteria/">it’s subjective anyway</a>). Ben McCormick points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities.” - <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">Ben McCormick</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My experience supports Patrick’s and Ben’s assertions, so now the question is, how can you become one of the people whose name comes up before a job is publicly available?</p>
<p><strong>The right people have to know you. You have to have the right kind of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="levels-of-writing-influence">Levels of Writing Influence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know…It’s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage.” - <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">Joel Spolsky</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you buy my assertion that influence is important in your career as a software developer, the next step is for me to convince you that writing will actually increase your influence. In fact, not all writing will work. The kind of writing you do will make a massive difference on the level and kind of influence you gain.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KwA6AQe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the different levels of influence you can achieve as a software developer and the kinds of writing you need to do to achieve them.</p>
<h3 id="1-willing-participant">1. Willing Participant</h3>
<p>Participants are not influential. They don’t realize it, but they have very little control over their career and are likely to go through a period of unemployment and grueling job interviews every time they need a new job. The only writing a Willing Participant will do is what’s required of them: they’ll respond to Slack messages and emails; they’ll dutifully enter their progress report every day; they might leave a sticky note on someone’s desk (or the digital equivalent) when they want to have a protracted discussion about an issue.</p>
<p>If this is you, don’t be discouraged. We all start our careers as Willing Participants. With <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harness-2020-state-of-developer-satisfaction-report-shows-impact-of-coronavirus-on-software-development-301119564.html">most software engineering jobs staying remote for the foreseeable future</a>, the minimum level of writing ability is likely to increase, but just checking the box isn’t going to put your name on the tip of your next boss’ tongue.</p>
<h3 id="2-organizational-teacher">2. Organizational Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every time you find yourself following the manual instead of writing the manual, you’re avoiding the anguish and giving in to the resistance.” - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371V91S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Seth Godin, Linchpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most software engineers live in this zone. Organizational Teachers write documentation, technical specifications, style guides, testing criteria, bug reports, and internal knowledge base articles. While this gives you a little influence over how your team (and possibly some adjacent teams) does its job, it’s unlikely that anyone outside your company will hear about your work.</p>
<p>The good thing about being in this zone is that it’s a safe place to practice. Nobody’s going to berate you for your typos (at least, I hope not), and other stakeholders will review most of your writing before it’s made generally available.</p>
<p>The downside to being an Organizational Teacher is that it’s pretty much table stakes for senior engineers. You’re not going to stand out for it, and you probably won’t get your name attached to it (unless it’s buried in your commit history). Hone your writing skills as an Organizational Teacher, and once you feel more comfortable, move up the ladder.</p>
<h3 id="3-organizational-influencer">3. Organizational Influencer</h3>
<p>As you move into an (official or unofficial) leadership role, you’ll start to do more writing at the Organizational Influencer level. This writing includes setting hiring criteria, documenting tradeoffs between complex technical decisions, creating training materials, and setting budgets. These documents will be seen by people above and below your station and will help get you noticed for future promotions.</p>
<p>Many software developers assume that they <em>should not</em> attempt to contribute this kind of writing unless asked. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re given a new project, you have a professional obligation to report shortcomings in the design. When you report these issues, don’t just write a Slack message, “This won’t work.” <a href="https://melsatar.blog/2017/09/23/trade-off-analysis-technique-make-the-decision-easier/">Document the tradeoffs</a> between the proposed solution and one that you’ve seen work elsewhere. Most people don’t do this because it’s hard, and that’s why they don’t have much influence.</p>
<p>Organizational Influencers are helping set the direction for at least a small part of the business, and they’ll end up doing more writing than those at the previous two levels. Software developers who make it to this level will be eligible for more internal promotions, interesting lateral moves, and a general increase in respect. Organizational Influencers will also start to gain the confidence to start writing externally.</p>
<h3 id="4-external-teacher">4. External Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Writing is hard. People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn’t something you can fake. It isn’t something you can buy. You have to work at it.
That’s exactly why people who are afraid they can’t write should be blogging. It’s exercise.” - <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/">Jeff Atwood</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the prevalence of <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>, surprisingly few software engineers ever write publicly. External Teachers generally start by writing technical case studies, public documentation, and walkthroughs. This is where software developers can begin to publicly display their knowledge and build a personal brand.</p>
<p>I’ll put a big caveat here and say that writing a few tutorials will not immediately make employers hunt you down. I’ve written dozens of technical tutorials over the years, and only a couple of them led directly to an employment discussion (neither of which worked out). Writing publicly is the first step in building a reputation, but more importantly, it gives you a great resource to point to when an employer asks you about a specific technical experience you’ve had.</p>
<p>The hard part about becoming an External Teacher is that it’s scary, and you’re likely to suck at first. People <a href="https://medium.com/@cinzia.dubois/the-importance-of-doing-things-youre-bad-at-4fcdd4c2fb4b">naturally avoid doing things they’re bad at</a>, but doing scary things is an essential part of gaining influence.</p>
<p>If you overcome the fear of writing publicly and you start to tell people about your writing, you’ll probably be surprised by the encouragement you get. People will root for you when you do something they’re scared to do themselves.</p>
<h3 id="5-external-influencer">5. External Influencer</h3>
<p>So few people achieve the level of External Influencer that just attempting this sort of writing puts you in a tiny, standout class of people. Unlike the External Teacher, who sticks to irrefutable facts and rehashes of existing knowledge, the External Influencer has a strong point of view. They write from deep experience, and their writing influences the decisions that others make.</p>
<p>Some of the External Influencers you’ve probably heard of include <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">“Uncle” Bob Martin</a>, and <a href="https://domainlanguage.com/">Eric Evans</a>. When they write something, thousands of programmers listen, and their books have shaped decades of software architecture.</p>
<p>There are degrees to all the influence levels in this model. You don’t have to be Uncle Bob to be an External Influencer; you just need to start applying your technical experience to larger business challenges in a public forum. For example, Eric Evans created Domain-Driven Design to help businesses build better software by making it more closely resemble the underlying domain model. If you’ve spent years solving a particular set of problems, you probably have at least a few issues you could get on a soapbox about. These are likely your platform for becoming an External Influencer.</p>
<p>While it sounds great, acting like an External Influencer is even scarier than being an External Teacher. Not only does your writing have to be factually accurate and coherent, but you’re also opening your ideas to public criticism. Nobody likes to get slammed on the internet, but the upside can be huge if your work is well-received. Do you think Martin Fowler would ever have trouble getting a job if he decided to leave ThoughtWorks? I’m pretty sure he could (literally) write his own job description just about anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="write-above-your-level">Write Above Your Level</h2>
<p>By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that influence is an important part of advancing your software development career and that writing can help you gain this influence. My final encouragement to engineers who want to become better writers is to push beyond your current level. It will be uncomfortable, but it’s also one of the best ways to take control of your career. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Let me know if I can help</a>.</p>

        <blockquote><p>You’ve got a new application underway. You need to map out some kind of testing schedule. Here’s advice from the experts about how to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>How do you accurately estimate how many QA engineers you need for a project? Like many of you, Karl Becker, a project team lead, was trying to calculate an answer. “We’re a small team without a dedicated QA staff—we basically just passed the QA hat around,” says Becker. “Recently, we hired a dedicated a QA person and we’re trying to figure out if we should hire more.”</p>
<p>It turns out, the most important part of Becker’s question isn’t <em>how many</em> but <em>when</em>. There’s a growing consensus about the need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shift left</a> – that is, to put QA into the process much earlier.</p>
<p>“It’s an old-school mind-set that you don’t need to spend money on QA resources until the very end of a project,” says Robert Jackson, a gaming industry veteran and VP of Mobile Publishing. “That no longer works. You’ve got to budget QA resources from the <em>beginning</em> of the project and allow enough time for multiple rounds of testing.”</p>
<p>Jackson creates his product development budgets with an 80/20 ratio in mind. “If you’re <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">an experienced manager</a>, you should be able to accurately predict about 80% of what you’ll need before you start development,” he says. “But you’ve also got to plan for surprises, so assume 20% of your plan will change.” To accommodate this, Jackson recommends, “Plan for additional resources at ‘crunch time.’ The last thing you want is to go to upper management and say, ‘I need more resources.’”</p>
<p>Correctly budgeting for additional staff is a function of project complexity. At a bare minimum, you should have two to three full-team QA team members for any project. “At alpha build, you want at least a couple of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">fully-dedicated QA resources</a> to do a complete sweep of the product and to de-bug every issue before beta,” warns Jackson, with a heavy emphasis on <em>at least</em>. Be aware as you budget that you may need to add specialists to your team before release, such as software/hardware compatibility testers and <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-difference-between-load-testing-stress-testing/">load testers</a>.</p>
<p>For a complex project, Jackson suggests you begin with a ballpark figure that you need at least one QA person for every six developers. That’s true especially if the project is going to take over a year to develop and it includes extensive database or back-end communication.</p>
<h3>Start QA staffing early in the schedule</h3>
<p>It is essential that QA is an integral part of development from the beginning, not just a proofreading step at the end. “The more QA is involved, the better your product is,” says Jackson. “Fixing issues in the final two weeks of development just doesn’t work. More often than not, the project will be coming in ‘hot,’ so make sure you plan for additional resources at the end of the development.”</p>
<p>To that end, Jackson strongly recommends assigning a QA lead to attend the very first development meeting and to continue as an integral part of the regular review process. “The earlier in the process you start QA, the more knowledgeable your QA team is. You want them to become as expert on your project as the designers. This way, they’ll know what resources they’ll need at each stage of the development process.”</p>
<p>There is one key requirement for this QA lead, according to Jackson: Don’t pick someone who’s too junior. Instead, he encourages managers to look at this role as an opportunity to grow new leaders. “Find someone who is creative, enthusiastic, and has good communication skills but is also senior enough to assess the landscape of the project—put them in that first developer’s meeting, mentor them, and let them thrive.”</p>
<h3>Quantify needs for upper management</h3>
<p>Obviously, one clue you need to add more QA staff is that they’re so overworked that they threaten to quit – or they do. But before it comes to that, is there a more quantified way to anticipate future needs?</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ojK9Q_ARE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a>, “The [answer] is more like guidelines than actual rules.” So welcome aboard the Black Pearl, as we attempt to give you some metrics.</p>
<p>First, to reassure you that you’re not alone: Two years ago, the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) published a 44-page report on <a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2018-report/The-Cost-of-Poor-Quality-Software-in-the-US-2018-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cost of Poor Quality Software</a>. As the report states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On average, software developers make 100 to 150 errors for every thousand lines of code…. Even if only a small fraction—say 10 percent—of these errors are serious, then a relatively small application of 20,000 lines of code will have roughly 200 serious coding errors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, that estimate is based on a textbook written in 1996. There have been <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2898571/basis-for-claim-that-the-number-of-bugs-per-line-of-code-is-constant-regardless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other estimates</a>, some of which put the error rate down as low as 1/1000. Nevertheless, most of those estimates are also based on work done over a decade ago.</p>
<p>The ideal approach is to look at similar projects in your own company to understand your team’s error rates, which is why it’s important to document results. If no comparable projects exist, discretely ask around. Obviously, there’s a limit to how helpful people are willing to be—you’re not going to call up your biggest competitor and say, “Hey, we’re also working on a dating app.” But if you dig through trade articles and online forums, you can likely fill in some reasonable numbers.</p>
<p>So far we’ve discussed one metric: What’s it going to take to get the product out the door? But <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/marc-s-martin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc S. Martin, a partner at Perkins-Coie</a> suggests an even more important metric to consider: <em>What’s the worst thing your product can do to the end-user?</em></p>
<p>Set a target error rate <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">based on the criticality of the product</a>. “A line of code driving a pacemaker is different from keeping your calendar, so a standard can and <em>should</em> vary,” says Martin.</p>
<p>Ask yourself questions like these: If we screw up, can someone die? If we screw up, can someone lose their home? If we screw up, will someone be behind on all their bills and unable to eat? If we screw up, will we trigger a class action lawsuit that will bankrupt the company? These may not be questions you can answer by yourself; they may require discussions with upper management or even your legal counsel.</p>
<p>Once everyone’s signed off on the target error rate, you can create your own algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on similar projects, this project will require <em>~n</em> lines of code.</li>
<li>Based on similar teams, the error rate is likely to be <em>~n</em>/per 1000 lines.</li>
<li>Based on similar projects, our senior QA engineers catch <em>~n</em> errors in an eight-hour workday. (Remember the rate drops if they go into heavy overtime.)</li>
<li>Based on similar projects, our junior QA engineers catch <em>~n</em> errors in an 8-hour workday. (Again, the rate drops if they go into heavy overtime.)</li>
<li>This project can tolerate no more than <em>n</em>% error rate.</li>
<li>This project is budgeted to take no more than <em>~n</em></li>
<li>Therefore, we need <em>at a minimum n</em> senior staff and <em>n</em> junior staff. Ideally, we should have<em> n</em>+.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, there’s going to be a lot of guesstimating. Still, at least it quantifies <em>something</em>, so you can go to senior management and say, “At a rough estimate, based on similar projects, we’re looking at 700 serious errors. You’ve only given me the resources to catch 400 of them before we release. Are you comfortable with that?”</p>
<p>Fight hard for your staff. Writing in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3130217/the-era-of-nine-digit-defects.html">InfoWorld</a>, Dr. Bill Curtis, CISQ executive director, summed up what’s at stake for upper management: “When losses from IT malfunctions hit 5 or 6 digits, IT managers are at risk. When losses hit 7 or 8 digits, IT and line-of-business executives are at risk. When losses hit 9 digits C-Level jobs are at risk.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone fears legacy systems; it’s like pulling a rogue thread on an old sweater that’s apt to unravel. But the longer you leave legacy software alone, the worse the situation becomes. As <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/the-true-cost-of-legacy-testing/">this white paper demonstrates</a>, Functionize can help.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Polls reveal people's opinion. When you vote in a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls">Twitter poll</a>, your identity remains private. You know the poll result when it ends or after you vote. The end time of a poll is configurable by the original poster. It varies from 5 minutes to 7 days. Sometimes you may want to know the poll result before voting for some reason.</p><p>With the help of a bookmarklet, you can do that. Just click and drag the button below to your bookmarks bar. Mobile users can go to the bottom of this page to know how to make this work on mobile.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Twitter Poll Result</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>To test this bookmarklet, you have to find a tweet with a poll.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>When I wrote this post 2 years ago, the logic was simple. Twitter was hiding the poll results with some CSS &amp; JS. It's not the case anymore. I had to work hard to come up with a solution. Anyway, it works now. If you don't want to know any technical details, you can skip to the bottom of this post to know how to reveal the results without voting on mobile.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Twitter was making requests to their server every 30 seconds to get the latest status of the poll. The bookmarklet just intercepts the Twitter requests by defining a custom <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> open method and listens to the <code>load</code> event to get the result of the poll.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You can find the source code of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/vicke4/891b14bbf46f247fb7314cb3565d1797">Twitter poll result script</a> as a gist.</p><p>Now, all you have to do is open any tweet with a poll and click on the bookmarklet.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

                    <p><em>Working as a core maintainer for <a href="https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning">PyTorch Lightning</a>, I've grown a strong appreciation for the value of tests in software development. As I've been spinning up a new project at work, I've been spending a fair amount of time thinking about how we should test machine learning systems. A couple weeks ago, one of my coworkers sent me <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">a fascinating paper</a> on the topic which inspired me to dig in, collect my thoughts, and write this blog post.</em> </p><p>In this blog post, we'll cover what testing looks like for traditional software development, why testing machine learning systems can be different, and discuss some strategies for writing effective tests for machine learning systems. We'll also clarify the distinction between the closely related roles of evaluation and testing as part of the model development process. By the end of this blog post, I hope you're convinced of both the extra work required to effectively test machine learning systems and the value of doing such work.</p><h2 id="what-s-different-about-testing-machine-learning-systems">What's different about testing machine learning systems?</h2><p>In traditional software systems, humans write the logic which interacts with data to produce a desired behavior.

We're able to compare performance between multiple models and make relative judgements, but we're not immediately able to characterize specific model behaviors. For example, figuring out <em>where</em> the model is failing usually requires additional investigative work; one common practice here is to look through a list of the top most egregious model errors on the validation dataset and manually categorize these failure modes.</p><p>Assuming we write behavioral tests for our models (discussed below), there's also the question of whether or not we have enough tests! While traditional software tests have metrics such as the lines of code covered when running tests, this becomes harder to quantify when you shift your application logic from lines of code to parameters of a machine learning model. Do we want to quantify our test coverage with respect to the input data distribution? Or perhaps the possible activations inside the model?</p><p><a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/odena19a/odena19a.pdf">Odena et al</a>. introduce one possible metric for coverage where we track the model logits for all of the test examples and quantify the area covered by radial neighborhoods around these activation vectors. However, my perception is that as an industry we don't have a well-established convention here. In fact, it feels like that testing for machine learning systems is in such early days that this question of test coverage isn't really being asked by many people.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-difference-between-model-testing-and-model-evaluation">What's the difference between model testing and model evaluation?</h2><p>While reporting evaluation metrics is certainly a good practice for quality assurance during model development, I don't think it's sufficient. Without a granular report of specific behaviors, we won't be able to immediately understand the nuance of how behavior may change if we switch over to the new model. Additionally, we won't be able to track (and prevent) behavioral regressions for specific failure modes that had been previously addressed.</p><p>This can be especially dangerous for machine learning systems since often times failures happen silently. For example, you might improve the overall evaluation metric but introduce a regression on a critical subset of data. Or you could unknowingly add a gender bias to the model through the inclusion of a new dataset during training. We need more nuanced reports of model behavior to identify such cases, which is exactly where model testing can help.</p><p>For machine learning systems, we should be running model evaluation and model tests in parallel. </p><ul><li><strong>Model evaluation</strong> covers metrics and plots which summarize performance on a validation or test dataset.</li><li><strong>Model testing</strong> involves explicit checks for behaviors that we expect our model to follow.</li></ul><p>Both of these perspectives are instrumental in building high-quality models. </p><p>In practice, most people are doing a combination of the two where evaluation metrics are calculated automatically and some level of model "testing" is done <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/GwViP/carrying-out-error-analysis">manually through error analysis</a> (i.e. classifying failure modes). Developing model tests for machine learning systems can offer a systematic approach towards error analysis.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-write-model-tests">How do you write model tests?</h2><p>In my opinion, there's two general classes of model tests that we'll want to write.</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-train</strong> <strong>tests</strong> allow us to identify some bugs early on and short-circuit a training job.</li><li><strong>Post-train tests</strong> use the trained model artifact to inspect behaviors for a variety of important scenarios that we define.</li></ul><h3 id="pre-train-tests">Pre-train tests</h3><p>There's some tests that we can run without needing trained parameters. These tests include:</p><ul><li>check the shape of your model output and ensure it aligns with the labels in your dataset</li><li>check the output ranges and ensure it aligns with our expectations (eg. the output of a classification model should be a distribution with class probabilities that sum to 1)</li><li>make sure a single gradient step on a batch of data yields a decrease in your loss</li><li>make <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">assertions about your datasets</a></li><li>check for label leakage between your training and validation datasets</li></ul><p>The main goal here is to identify some errors early so we can avoid a wasted training job.</p><h3 id="post-train-tests">Post-train tests</h3><p>However, in order for us to be able to understand model behaviors we'll need to test against trained model artifacts. These tests aim to <strong>interrogate the logic learned during training</strong> and provide us with a behavioral report of model performance.</p><blockquote><strong>Paper highlight</strong>: <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf">Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList</a></blockquote><p>The authors of the above paper present three different types of model tests that we can use to understand behavioral attributes. </p><p><strong>Invariance Tests</strong></p><p>Invariance tests allow us to describe a set of perturbations we should be able to make to the input <em>without</em> affecting the model's output. We can use these perturbations to produce pairs of input examples (original and perturbed) and <strong>check for consistency</strong> in the model predictions. This is closely related to the concept of data augmentation, where we apply perturbations to inputs during training and preserve the original label. </p><p>For example, imagine running a sentiment analysis model on the following two sentences:</p><ul><li><u>Mark</u> was a great instructor.</li><li><u>Samantha</u> was a great instructor.</li></ul><p>We would expect that simply changing the name of the subject doesn't affect the model predictions. </p><p><strong>Directional Expectation Tests</strong></p><p>Directional expectation tests, on the other hand, allow us to define a set of perturbations to the input which <em>should</em> have a <em>predictable</em> effect on the model output. </p><p>For example, if we had a housing price prediction model we might assert:</p><ul><li>Increasing the number of bathrooms (holding all other features constant) should not cause a drop in price.</li><li>Lowering the square footage of the house (holding all other features constant) should not cause an increase in price.</li></ul><p>Let's consider a scenario where a model fails the second test - taking a random row from our validation dataset and decreasing the feature <code>house_sq_ft</code> yields a higher predicted price than the original label. This is surprising as it doesn't match our intuition, so we decide to look further into it. We realize that, without having a feature for the house's neighborhood/location, our model has learned that smaller units tend to be more expensive; this is due to the fact that smaller units from our dataset are more prevalent in cities where prices are generally higher. In this case, the <em>selection</em> of our dataset has influenced the model's logic in unintended ways - this isn't something …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

August 31, 2020 | https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>During <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-1/">last episode</a>, we went on a tour of the
pleasantly boring world of flash memory, drafted some driver interfaces, and
toyed with the idea of generics at both levels of crate visibility. What's
conspicuously absent is, well, <em>working code.</em> It's one thing to lay down data
structures, and another entirely to weave generics between the raw ones and
zeros of bare metal firmware. Today we'll gaze long into the void*, and,
hopefully, the void* won't gaze back into us.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-1/#what-is-flash-memory">section about flash
memory</a> we
explored, with the help of a dodgy analogy, how it's possible to directly
overwrite a <code>1</code> with a <code>0</code> but not the reverse. This quirk is what makes
writing efficient flash writers a bit tricky. When asked to write over a memory
range, a naive driver would simply erase every sector overlapped by it, then
write back the original data "merged" with the desired bytes. We want our driver
a bit smarter than that; it should first check whether it's possible to write
the bytes directly. In other words, we want to ensure that every <code>1</code> in our
intended write is also a <code>1</code> in the target space.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>BitSubset {
    </span><span>/// Check that every '1' bit is a '1' on the right hand side.
</span><span>    </span><span>fn </span><span>is_subset_of</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>rhs</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>bool</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That looks like a straightforward, simple trait to express the condition we want
to check. Here comes the unnecessary part: We're going to implement it
generically. Let's be honest, we <em>both</em> know we want to implement this for
<code>[u8]</code>. There shouldn't be much use for it other than slices of bytes. However,
doing it this way will help flex our generic muscles and illustrate a couple of
important points.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T: </span><span>Copy </span><span>+ </span><span>Eq </span><span>+ </span><span>BitOr&lt;Output=T&gt;&gt; BitSubset </span><span>for</span><span> [T] {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>is_subset_of</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>rhs</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>bool </span><span>{
        </span><span>if </span><span>self.</span><span>len</span><span>() </span><span>&gt;</span><span> rhs.</span><span>len</span><span>() {
            </span><span>false
        </span><span>} </span><span>else </span><span>{
            self.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>zip</span><span>(rhs.</span><span>iter</span><span>()).</span><span>all</span><span>(|(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>)| (</span><span>*</span><span>a </span><span>| *</span><span>b) </span><span>== *</span><span>b)
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, I feel that dread too. There are enough sigils up there to summon half
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon">Lesser Key of
Solomon</a>. We have
<strong>five</strong> types of brackets (<code>&lt;(|[{</code>) and we're barely getting started.
Fortunately symbols are much like ant invasions—live with them long enough and
you'll stop noticing. They can even be endearing.</p>
<p>When I started playing with Rust generics a few years ago, it often helped me to
approach functions by parts; focusing first on the constraints, moving to
the implementation only when I've painted a clear picture of the elements involved.
I find there's a bit of ritual in deciphering constraints, not unlike the
infamous <a href="http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html">spiral rule</a> for C
declarations. For me, it takes the form of describing them in a
manner of plain English pseudocode. For the above it would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have <em>something</em> that can be copied and compared.</li>
<li>It can be bitwise or'd with itself.</li>
<li>We are implementing over an array of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more complex lists I'd sing these conditions in my head a few times until
the abstract types coalesce into something more manageable, at which point it
becomes possible to push the sigil soup away and focus on behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All</strong> the behaviour of these type parameters is summarized in these
constraints. Nothing is implicit. That's <em>very cool</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, all that's left is a bit of iterator magic and bit wrangling.
<code>self.iter().zip(rhs.iter()).all(Condition)</code> "zips" two iterators together in
pairs, then verifies that every pair satisfies a condition. In our case the
condition is the closure <code>|(a, b)| (*a | *b) == *b</code>. For the condition to hold,
all <code>1</code> bits in element <code>*a</code> must also be <code>1</code> in <code>*b</code>.</p>
<p>We'll use this later to compare, as we anticipated, slices of bytes. What have
we gained from doing it generically?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Even though <code>T: Copy + Eq + BitOr&lt;Output=T&gt;</code> is certainly a lot wordier
than <code>u8</code>, it's also <strong>purer</strong> in some sense, because it more accurately
summarizes what we care about. Weirdly,
the shorter <code>u8</code> carries a lot more extraneous, distracting baggage:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is 8 bits long, which is a hardware detail we don't care about.</li>
<li>It is unsigned, which is a mathematical detail we don't care about.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, our platonic <code>T</code> is refreshingly simple: only does the things
that the implementation needs. And as such, the implementation <em>will be
correct now and forever after</em>, which leads to the next point:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When our constraints match the requirements of the implementation so tightly,
we can resort to blanket implementations, knowing that future users will opt
into this behaviour automatically if they define a type that matches these
requirements. Crates like the impressively elegant
<a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> take this idea further, using their prelude to
bring blanket implementations over a wide range of types without exposing the
user to the trait. This leads, I think, to very ergonomic APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not that we'd have any reason to suspect otherwise, but the
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5abac4">concrete</a> and
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/nxMW57">generic</a> versions produce identical assembly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've increased our sigil count, getting closer to summoning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimaris">Kimaris</a>, Marquis of Hell, ruler of 20
demonic legions, teacher of grammar, logic and rhetoric. Maybe he'll finally
produce an intuitive definition of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monad</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-1/#taking-a-step-back">the end of the last
entry</a>, we sketched out the
constraints on our minimal concept of address and region:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>Address: Ord + Copy + Add&lt;usize, Output = Self&gt; {}
</span><span>pub trait </span><span>Region&lt;A: Address&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: A) -&gt; </span><span>bool</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><em>But cuervo</em>, you ask, <em>that's not how it looked like last week. You added an</em>
<code>Add</code> <em>constraint.</em> Okay, hypothetical attentive reader, you got me. I may have
forgotten to copy that as I was curating the code examples. Yes, the
<code>core::ops::Add</code> bound will be necessary, as we'll see in a bit. This gives us
an excuse to sing the generics song, which works just as well for supertrait
definitons:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>Address</code> is <em>something</em> that can be sorted and copied. It can be added
together with an offset, yielding another address.</li>
<li>A <code>Region</code> is <em>something</em> that may contain an address.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we build with this? We know that one of the goals of our flash driver
is to smartly negotiate the different write and erase granularities, so that for
any given buffer write, only the required regions are erased. In order to do
this, there's a requirement we can accurately summarize in this way:</p>
<p><strong>For a buffer of given length, and for a base address in the target memory map,
we need to relate each buffer segment to every region it overlaps with.</strong></p>
<p>Here rendered through the power of ASCII:</p>
<pre><code><span>0    5    10   15   20   25   30   35
-----|ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo|------ : Buffer of length 30 at address 5
----------|====|====|====|====|----------- : Four regions of length 5 at address 10
</span></code></pre>
<p>Given the two inputs above, we need to produce the following four views into the
buffer:</p>
<pre><code><span>
0    5      10      15      20      25      30   35
-----|ooooo [ooooo] [ooooo] [ooooo] [ooooo] ooooo|-----
             view1   view2   view3   view4
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our goal in this section is to <em>define such operation generically</em>, and
<em>implement it generically</em>, in such a way that it will work with
last week's sectors, subsectors and pages from both drivers.</p>
<p>Now, if you're allergic to symbols, be warned: Here be dragons. Henceforth be
dragon turtles, all the way down. We are about to reach <em>ancient Egyptian
shopping in <a href="https://www.ecorax.net/as-above-so-below-2/akihabara.jpeg">Akihabara</a></em> levels of symbol overload. Believe me
that after some time none of them will feel superfluous or overwrought. As
with human language, precise definitions lead to better understanding.</p>
<p>Okay, let's take a deep breath.</p>
<pre><code><span>/// Iterator producing block-region pairs,
/// where each memory block maps to each region
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>OverlapIterator&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, A, R, I&gt;
where
    A: Address,
    R: Region&lt;A&gt;,
    I: Iterator&lt;Item = R&gt;,
{
    memory: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>],
    regions: I,
    base_address: A,
}

</span><span>pub trait </span><span>IterableByOverlaps&lt;'a, A, R, I&gt;
where
    A: Address,
    R: Region&lt;A&gt;,
    I: Iterator&lt;Item = R&gt;,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>overlaps</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>block</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>], </span><span>base_address</span><span>: A) -&gt; OverlapIterator&lt;A, R, I&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Hmm. Not too bad thus far. We have the tools necessary to break down the <em>where</em>
clause, which is identical for both the struct and the trait. We are dealing
with:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Some</em> address <code>A</code>.</li>
<li><em>Some</em> region <code>R</code> which contains such addresses.</li>
<li><em>Some</em> iterator <code>I</code> that yields such regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The explicit lifetime, a requisite of all structs containing references, simply
denotes that the <code>memory</code> field is a reference to data stored elsewhere, and
guarantees said data will exist <strong>at least</strong> as long as our struct.</p>
<p>What we've defined above is an iterator struct, and a trait for types that can
be iterated in a certain way. If you come from C, iterators can be a bit of a
mind bender. They <em>feel</em> heavy, but ultimately they're very
simple. I like to think of iterator structs as bookmarks for physical books;
progress trackers with just enough state to find your position in a sequence.</p>
<p>Looking at our iterator struct above, we see we can track our progress through
the inner <code>regions</code> iterator, until we run out of regions. We also have a means
of producing this kind of iterator—the <code>overlaps</code> function in the
<code>IterableByOverlaps</code> trait—so all that's left is to define the <em>rules</em> of
iteration. The implementation I'm going to show you can do with some manual
optimization, and indeed it doesn't look exactly like this in the final
<code>Loadstone</code> code. I went with the slightly more readable option to better
illustrate the points in this article.</p>

Led by the German and French governments, a variety of stakeholders at national and European level (including OpenNebula Systems) are involved in GAIA-X, an ambitious project that aims to achieve an open, federated, secure and trustworthy data and cloud infrastructure for Europe.

A former director of engineering and Innovation Agitator at Google, Savoia has conducted a lot of research into what makes ideas work. The result is his book, which covers <strong>the processes you should use to determine whether your idea is a winning one — or is another failure</strong>.</p><p>The book is a superb starting point for starting entrepreneurs and anyone who wants to test an idea. So if you’re currently working on an idea for a product or service, and want to test it first before spending tremendous amounts of time and money in making it work, <strong>read a summary and book review of The Right It below</strong>.</p><h2>Highlights of The Right It</h2><p>The Right It starts with the idea that most startups are doomed to fail; something that Sevoia calls the Law of Market Failure. If you can find that one idea that actually works — that isn’t doomed to fail from the start — then that’s The Right It.</p><p>So how do you determine whether your idea is The Right It? By going through 4 different steps:</p><ol><li>Navigating Thoughtland</li><li>Creating hypotheses</li><li>Setting up a Pretotype, and acquiring YODA (Your Own DAta)</li><li>Using The Right It Meter to determine whether your idea is The Right It</li></ol><h3>Navigating Thoughtland</h3><p>Perhaps one of the most important concepts in The Right It is Thoughtland. Thoughtland is the place where only thoughts count.</p><p>At first, as an entrepreneur, you THINK that you have a great idea. And you THINK that your target group will buy your product.</p><p>So to test this, perhaps you run some qualitative research. You send a survey to your parents or even your ideal target group, and you get the results. Perhaps your target group indicated that you have a great idea on your hands. Your product is superb, and they will definitely buy it once you release it.</p><p><strong>The problem with this research, is that we’re all still in Thoughtland</strong>. You’ve shared your product idea — not much more than a collection of thoughts — and people responded to your survey with a collection of their thoughts. But according to Savoia:</p><blockquote><p>You cannot determine if an idea is The Right It just through thinking. Not through your thoughts — not through the thoughts and opinions of others. [Not even] through the thoughts of ‘experts’.</p></blockquote><p>Rather, to truly determine whether your idea is The Right It, you have to get YODA to help you: Your Own Data.</p><p>Instead of using someone else’s market research, opinions, or success in the market, <strong>you can only test whether you have the right it if you gather data yourself. You have to get Your Own DAta</strong>.</p><p>So how do you do get YODA to help out?</p><h3>Hypothesizing and Hypozooming</h3><p>According to Sevoia, the first step is making a clear and specific Market Engagagement Hypothesis or MEH. <strong>The Market Engagement Hypothesis identifies the key belief or assumption about how the market will engage with your product or idea</strong>.</p><p>So how does it work? Well, let’s take an example. Suppose you want to sell socks with different logos of cryptocurrencies: CryptoSocks. Why would people buy from you?</p><p>Perhaps your hypothesis is: If we put cryptocurrency logo’s on socks and make them as colorful as Happy Socks, many people who own cryptocurrencies are willing to buy socks with their favorite cryptocurrency logo on it.</p><p>This sounds pretty good, but it’s not very specific yet. So after creating this initial hypothesis, the next step is to create a so-called <strong>XYZ Hypothesis: At least X% of Y will Z.</strong></p><p>In this case, perhaps we hypothesize that at least 5% of all cryptocurrency owners will want to buy CryptoSocks.</p><p>A third step, is to take this XYZ Hypothesis further and <em>hypozoom</em> (yes, the author is quite a fan of creating his own words). With hypozooming, Sevoia means to say that you create an even more specific and zoomed-in hypothesis that you can test <em><strong>right now</strong></em><em>.</em></p><p>For instance, we could say that at least 5% of cryptocurrency owners in my hometown Utrecht, will want to pay €5 for a pair of CryptoSocks. With this zoomed-in (or <em>hypozoomed</em>) Market Engagement Hypothesis, I can actually start gathering data and find out whether CryptoSocks are a good idea or not.</p><h3>No MVPs, no Prototyping — But Pretotyping</h3><p>So, how do you do this? Well, with a&nbsp;<em>pretotype</em>. Another made-up word, a pretotype is not the same as an MVP or prototype. Rather than being functional (as an MVP often is) or a catch-all concept (as a prototype is), a pretotype is a fake or mocked-up version of your intended product or service.</p><p><strong>The goal of any pretotype is to validate quickly whether it’s worth it to pursue your product or service idea</strong>. So let’s apply that to our CryptoSocks.</p><p>In software development, it is quite common to whip up a landing page for a product without actually selling that product. For instance, I could create an online page for our Cryptosocks, with one ‘buy button’ for everyone’s favorite: Bitcoin socks.</p><p>I would then send an email with the link to the page to all cryptocurrency owners in Utrecht I know — and see how many percent of those (that visit the page) actually press the ‘Buy Now’ button.</p><p>This is an example of a Fake Door pretotype which in software is often called a <em>Smoke Test</em>. Importantly, running this experiment would give me data that I created myself — Your Own Data!</p><p>The next step is to evaluate this data, and finally determine whether CryptoSocks are The Right It. But before we do that, let’s discuss some other examples of Pretotypes.</p><h4>Examples of Pretotypes</h4><p>This Fake Door is just one example of a Pretotype; there are many others. The idea of a Pretotype is always to test your (hypozoomed) hypothesis in a quick-and-dirty way, to validate whether you’re building The Right It.</p><p>Consider for instance these Pretotype Examples:</p><ul><li>The One-Night Stand Pretotype (offer something very briefly – e.g. Airbnb founders renting out an air mattress for the night)</li><li>The Infiltrator Pretotype (place your product in someone else’s sales environment – e.g. leave a kitchen utensil in IKEA and see how many people buy it)</li><li>The Relabel Pretotype (put a different label on an existing product and put it in front of a user – e.g. a fake book cover)</li><li>The Live Demo Pretotype (give users a live-but-fake demo of your product/service)</li><li>The Morsel Pretotype (provide a sample of the full product, e.g. a sample chapter of a book)</li></ul><p>But there are many more such as the Mechanical Turk Pretotype, the Pinocchio Pretotype, the Fake Door Pretotype, the Facade Pretotype, and the YouTube Pretotype.</p><p>On his website, Savoia provides an interesting <a href="https://www.albertosavoia.com/uploads/1/4/0/9/14099067/pretotyping_quick_reference_for_stanford_ms_e_277.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of more examples</a>.</p><h3>The Right It (TRI) Meter</h3><p>So with that in mind, let’s move to the last step. After creating the pretotype and running the test, <strong>how do you determine whether your idea is actually something worth investing more time and money in?</strong></p><p>We use the TRI Meter. <strong>The Right It Meter is a tool used to interpret your data as objectively as possible</strong>. Specifically, it consists of different boxes, each with a ‘likelihood of success’ for your idea to beat the Law of Market Failure.</p><p><img src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg" alt="The Right It Meter" width="300" height="301" srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20301'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg 300w, https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter-150x150.jpg 150w" data-lazy-src="https://jochemgerritsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Right-It-Meter.jpg"></p><p>Let’s go back to our CryptoSocks. We hypothesized that 5% of cryptocurrency owners in the town of Utrecht, will want to pay €5 for a pair of CryptoSocks. Suppose we created our pretotype and have our data.</p><p>In the end, we find that only 1% of people who landed on our page pressed the buy button. Now we ask ourselves: If only 1% of cryptocurrency owners (in Utrecht) want to buy our socks, how likely is it that our idea is The Right It?&nbsp;On that basis, you point an arrow to the right box in the TRI Meter.</p><p>In the case of CryptoSocks, I think ‘Unlikely’ or a 30% chance is fair.</p><p>But it doesn’t stop here! <strong>You need to run a few experiments to really determine whether your idea is an investment worth making</strong>. Preferably, we tweak our idea a little bit (perhaps we create ‘TechSocks’ rather than CryptoSocks), create a new pretotype, and run a new experiment.</p><p>If all goes well, you can keep running experiments, tweaking and <em>pivoting</em> (in Lean Startup terms) until you’ve added several ideas to the ‘Very Likely’ box. <strong>Then, you truly know that the idea you have is The Right It</strong>.</p><h2>Applying the Lessons of The Right It</h2><p>Considering this summary of the book and all these pretotypes, there’s a lot to take in. So how do you apply the lessons of The Right It?</p><p>Actually, <strong>if you use the above steps, you’ve applied all the major lessons of this book</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>First</strong>, create a Market Engagement Hypothesis, then hypozoom, and create an XYZ hypothesis that is specific and measurable.</li><li><strong>Second</strong>, consider different types of pretotypes, as discussed above. What pretotype best fits your product or service?</li><li><strong>Third</strong>, set up your pretotype and run a first test.</li><li><strong>Fourth</strong> and last, consider your data and where it falls along the TRI Meter. On that basis, revise your idea or your pretotype and run another test. Keep going until you are (much more) confident that you’ve found The Right It!</li></ul><p>In addition, you can check out the author’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sUozPcH4fY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lecture on YouTube</a>, which provides another summary of the book.</p><h2>The Right It Book Review by an entrepreneur</h2><p>There are many books that give actionable advice to people who want to set up a business and do it right. From the Lean Startup by Eric Ries (and its build-measure-learn loop) to the Build Trap by Melissa Perri, the Lean Product Playbook (and its <a href="https://jochemgerritsen.com/2019/10/problem-space-and-solution-space/">Problem Space and Solution Space</a>), and many more.</p><p>In a way, these books look alike because just like The Right It, they all come down to one idea. The idea that&nbsp;you need to focus on a problem first (not a solution) — and that you need to stop theorizing and start …</p></div></div>

            <section>
            <div>
                <div><p>“You sound like a 17-year-old teenager looking at the world and feeling insecure about what he wants to do with his life!” my friend Matthias exclaimed to me in a most affectionate tone as I was feebly talking about this and that and mostly about how I couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do or even how I felt.</p>
<p>Time and again I’ve come to find one of my most hated states of all: <b>when I feel unsure and insecure about myself in my own body</b>. It’s most cunning and often affects me over days and sometimes weeks. Mainly because I struggle to name it and to include it in my range of acceptable human experiences and as a part of my existence. So I end up walking around feeling insecure and unsure without being able to recognize it. That’s doubly taxing to my nervous system.</p>
<p>When my friend pointed it out in that phone call, I immediately relaxed and felt a sense of peace. Oh yeah, insecurity! As much as I don’t like that state and have shame, disgust, and anger when it comes up, as well as all kinds of stories and ideas around how it’s not a good thing to feel insecure, something shifted. Naming it was like the beginning of releasing a bondage rope wrapped around my chest and belly.</p>
<p>On top of that comes another layer of shame that through my profession as a coach and with my experience in meditation and other kinds of healing and wellbeing modalities, this shouldn’t happen to me in the way that it does.</p>
<h2><b>The vulnerability of insecurity</b></h2>
<p>There’s been a powerful shift I see many people go through of leaning more into our vulnerability in recent years around different feelings and experiences. Yet, I find that the vulnerability around feeling insecure is a double-whammy:</p>
<ul>
<li>It first requires us to be in touch with our true selves: the experience of being vulnerable</li>
<li>And then to recognize that the thing that is there is a shaky, uneasy, quivery experience of ourselves, which is an extra layer of vulnerable yet again.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems natural that our brains have built protection around us going into this two-fold level of vulnerability. It already screams “It’s not safe!” from far away. And staying from being in touch with those experiences seems like a safer, easier option. But only on the surface!</p>
<p>As long as we don’t find the courage or the space to go into our experience, it will continue to drive us from the unconscious. Our choice lies in the naming and feeling of it, to be freed from its bonds, not in the choice of having it or not.</p>
<h2><b>The unsure CEO</b></h2>
<p>What I can’t do for myself, I sometimes find a lot easier to support other people with. D’uh! We often teach what we ourselves struggle with and need to learn the most a coach I’ve learned a lot from tells me.</p>
<p>And on a number of occasions I’ve introduced my clients to the concept of “the unsure CEO”. At first, this is deeply terrifying and goes against everything they’ve read or heard about how a CEO should act. And yet, it’s such a striking counter-archetype. Simply imagining what an unsure CEO would look and feel like if she accepted herself can bring a lot of resolution.</p>
<p>Most of my clients that have included the unsure CEO as a part of their persona toolkit have reported that it has brought them ease. Counter to their fears, they haven’t ended up being only the unsure CEO.</p>
<p>If you’re a CEO struggling to ever acknowledge your own self-doubts and wavering feelings of commitment, <b>try on the hat of the unsure CEO</b>. See what it’s like to make that a persona that is allowed to have space in your life and experience of things.</p>
<h2><b>The thing that’s right in front of you</b></h2>
<p>The puzzling experience of feeling unsure is that most of us haven’t learned to identify it as a thing. When we say “I can’t decide if I want to do A or B!” what eludes us that the thing right in front of us is that we can’t decide. That we’re unsure whether A or B is the thing that’s best for us. And that unsureness of ourselves is&nbsp;something and not nothing. Conventionally we’ve just overlooked it and I’d argue it’s something of a collective blind-spot. I know very few people who are comfortable in their unsureness about themselves or a situation.</p>
<p>Once we bring it into our awareness, we’ve gained a massive opportunity to unfold into our aliveness. One that is three-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>you get to integrate an important human experience into your tool-belt: that of being unsure.</li>
<li>you get to explore and be present to sensations, feelings, and thoughts you’ve previously had running through you on auto-pilot. For me, it’s a shakiness in the belly and a slight headache around the temples. Then there is constant chatter weighing multiple options in my mind and raised shoulders, just to name some parts of it. It’s a unique cocktail of experiences, that if I drop my story around how it’s not a good or bad thing to be feeling it, I can almost get to enjoying and appreciating it.</li>
<li>you get to support others and not feel scared or feel the need to “fix” or “advice them” out of their situation if they themselves are feeling unsure too.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How to be with being unsure (or any other&nbsp;emotional state)</b></h2>
<p>This, as usual with most of our experiences, is the easy part once we’ve identified what it is that we need to be with that’s right in front of us in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Notice</b>: When it comes up, my most trusted method is to notice, simply notice. And to begin noticing most pointedly how my body is feeling. That is where I usually find the bulk of the experience is coming from. The thoughts and feelings that accompany the body seem to be something like second-order items, important, but often influenced by my bodily state.</li>
<li><b>Accept</b>: Usually I have to expand my noticing to include also my relationship with what I’m noticing. With the sense of feeling unsure for example, I’ve also felt angry, disgusted, annoyed, and ashamed. Since those are present in relation to feeling unsure, it’ll be hard to let them have space if they are not also noticed and accepted as being present. My experience is that unless I can come to my emotional state with a sense of warm curiosity, through the help of a trusted friend or professional, it’ll be difficult for it to actually expand and have room to flow through me.</li>
<li><b>Follow</b>: Once I’ve noticed something or enough things, there’s usually an opportunity to follow an experience, feeling, or thought. The shakiness in the belly wants to expand into the legs. From the legs, it turns into a tingling in the feet. From there, it becomes a warm sensation of feeling peaceful and at ease.</li>
<li><b>Rest</b>: After a process like this that can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours, there can be a good point to rest and do something entirely different, not related to what I’ve just felt into. This might be going to the sauna, have some food, go for a walk, spend time with friends or spouses, what have you, you know yourself best around what brings you restful relaxation.</li>
<li><b>Optional: Integration/Analysis</b>: If I’m most present with myself, I steer away from self-analysis for as long as I can. That means putting questions like “Why am I this way?” or “Where did this come from?” to the very end of my exploration. Too often they aren’t helpful when introduced early on, since it leads to little expansion or resolution and just thoughts turning in on themselves more and more, furthering the constriction around what we’re already haven’t spent enough time to just be with, instead of analyzing it. <b>True integration and analysis have the experience of feeling fresh and new, coming from the unfolding of things that happened before.</b> The fresher the insight feels, the more I’d trust it as guidance. The more familiar it feels, the more I might wonder if I’ve truly touched into what’s going on for me.</li>
</ul>

Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year …</p></div></div>

<p>Yeah, this is one those articles. You see these pop up in your favorite news aggregator when Apple does something stupid. The last wave was with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-vs-scissor-keyboard/">butterfly switch keyboards</a>. </p>



<p>Why did I make the switch? Because my Mac got really old and where I live, they are damn expensive to buy. I had to find an answer to my “can there be equally pleasing work environment without a Mac?” question before spending bunch of money.</p>



<h2>My Workflow</h2>



<p>My workflow is very basic web developer workflow. I’m a backend developer by day but I do lots of JavaScript/HTML/CSS <a href="https://blog.cemunalan.com.tr/projects/" title="Projects">on my side projects</a>. My main editor is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> for PHP and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> for other everything else. I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to run projects on my local environment but working with a low-end Mac, it is difficult. I have really gotten used to <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork</a> and <a href="https://sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> as my go-to tools when doing development. I use the standard Apple Terminal. That’s about it.</p>



<p>I got the Late 2013 Macbook Pro 13 inch with 4GB RAM back in 2014. It was not impressive when I first got it and it certainly not impressive now. I mean it was not a bad buy. I have been using it for the last 6 years and I can still do some light work on it. Even the battery still holds up for about 3-4 hours after 1200 cycles.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.cemunalan.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ekran-Resmi-2020-06-23-07.56.27.png?resize=247%2C394&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="247" height="394" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/blog.cemunalan.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ekran-Resmi-2020-06-23-07.56.27.png?w=536&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.cemunalan.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ekran-Resmi-2020-06-23-07.56.27.png?resize=188%2C300&amp;ssl=1 188w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/blog.cemunalan.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ekran-Resmi-2020-06-23-07.56.27.png?w=536&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.cemunalan.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ekran-Resmi-2020-06-23-07.56.27.png?resize=188%2C300&amp;ssl=1 188w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.cemunalan.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ekran-Resmi-2020-06-23-07.56.27.png?resize=247%2C394&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>State of the battery</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>But anything other than light work just does not cut it. Coding in an IDE such as PHPStorm? Docker? Slack, Spotify and bunch of other Electron apps running in the background? You’ll see the computer crumble with continuous swapping. </p>



<p>So last year I have built a Hackintosh from my old desktop. It worked like a treat even with an AMD CPU. The only drawback was that Docker was not working. That’s a known and sort of unsolvable problem. So after a while it was a no-go for me.</p>

<p>So I jumped the ship. I wanted native Docker speed on my local development workflow and installed Ubuntu 20.04. Here is what happened.</p>



<h2>Docker</h2>



<p>Yeah, it is amazing. Running your local web app using Docker on Linux gives you incredible performance. There is no hidden Ubuntu VM in between like in the Docker for Mac. It just works natively. Performance and ease of use is alone a good reason to switch to Ubuntu (or any Linux distro, really). If you are using Docker in your local development setup, you should seriously consider switching to Linux.</p>



<p>Here is an example. A simple PHP request with the Laravel framework may take multiple seconds with Docker for Mac. At my last day time job, I used to get a timeout from the server since PHP does not respond in 30 seconds. Yikes. So iterating, doing multiple refreshes on a page was a very slow process. On my Ubuntu setup same request generally takes around 80-100 ms, as it should be.</p>



<h2>The Keyboard Layout</h2>



<p>I think the MacOS idea of having “Cmd” key for system wide shortcuts and leaving “Ctrl” to do it’s on thing in the Terminal is brilliant. You kinda miss that when you switch to Linux as there is no such distinction. </p>



<p>I do still have a Mac so switching between Ubuntu and a Mac was a struggle as keyboard and shortcuts change dramatically. After some time I have discovered <a href="https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto">Kinto</a>. </p>



<p>It markets itself as “Type in Linux &amp; Windows like it’s a Mac” and I can say that it does it’s job very well.</p>



<p>This is a very noob friendly tool that runs a program on your computer that listens to your keyboard inputs. It also knows which program is active on the screen so it can make decisions based upon that. </p>



<p>So if you are in Firefox pressing “Alt + C” on your keyboard equals to “Ctrl + C”. Just like “Cmd + C” on a Mac. However if you are on a Terminal emulator, pressing “Alt + C” means “Ctrl + Shift + C” which is a copy. You have to press “Ctrl + C” on your keyboard to make it register a “Ctrl +C”. So it’s basically same as using a Mac. </p>



<p>If I didn’t own a Mac, I would suck it up get used to the keyboard mapping but currently this setup makes me very happy.</p>



<h2>Installing apps: Snaps and AppImages</h2>



<p>Snaps are <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/02/linux_mint_team_snap/">controversial</a>. Since I’m new to the Linux distros, I just wanted to go to the most streamline way of doings things. I gave the default Ubuntu Software Center and snaps a chance when installing apps. </p>



<p>I would say from a new comer point of view that they are… fine? To my experience programs are extremely easy to install/uninstall. I think that’s very important especially when you are new to an operating system. You try bunch of things, explore programs, install them, remove them after 5 minutes and don’t have to worry about dependencies or configurations left behind. </p>



<p>It keeps the old versions of the programs in disk so you can do a rollback. This saved me big time the other day as Slack’s latest 4.7.0 release started crashing. I had to revert to 4.4.3 and it was… very convenient. Just a simple command to do the roll back.</p>



<p>There are of course some problems. For example they are incredibly slow to boot up. Like opening up a calculator takes multiple seconds. Makes you think you are using a HDD instead of SSD.</p>



<p>I believe due to some sandboxing problems, clicking links on Slack and Skype was not working for me. It simply does not open the links in the default browser. You have to dive into the forums and figure out what the hell is going on.</p>



<p>So there are definitely some problems with them but I also benefited features that are not in “apt-get” quite a lot.</p>



<p>Some of the apps I use are not distributed as snaps but rather as AppImages. Those are quite common especially with Electron apps. These AppImages resemble installing a regular Mac app that you drag and drop to your Applications folder and just click to execute. </p>



<p>On Linux it might not be straightforward as your Desktop environment (Gnome or KDE) may not pick up the icon of the app to show in dock or it might not create a item in applications list (For example for Gnome you should add a desktop item manually). You once again have to learn how to make your app appear in your desktop environment and read some forums. So not as convenient as I hoped it would be.</p>



<h2>Web Development Tools</h2>



<p>I think there is no point arguing whether if there are enough web development tools in Linux. All of the IDE’s released by JetBrains are in Snap Store, ready to be installed with one click. Electron apps are not efficient in terms of resource management however I’m grateful that they exist now that I’m on Linux. Lot of the apps that would normally not see a light of day on Linux are now readily available. </p>



<p>So it was very easy for me to find replacements for my web development tools. </p>



<p>In terms of terminal, I was not expecting anything fancy since I was a Terminal.app user on a Mac. Gnome Terminal does the trick for me.</p>



<p>I was a huge Sequel Pro user. Sequel Pro is a very unique that it basically does not have a replacement in any platform and people keep using it even though it’s very buggy. It literally crashes if you close a tab or a window and yet, multiple people at my last work including me was using it daily. So I was not expecting to find a feature-parity alternative on Linux. </p>



<p>First, I gave CLI tools a go. “mycli” is an <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/mycli">amazing CLI tool for MySQL</a>. It also has a <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/">PostgreSQL equivalent called “pgcli”</a>. It features a very solid autocomplete and generally more convenient than using the default MySQL CLI tool. I’m mostly using that for accessing databases.</p>



<p>As a backup, I have been using DataGrip if I want to do things in GUI. It’s very big and feature-full compared to the Sequel Pro but it’s a good backup. You may also want to take a look at <a href="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/">Beekeeper Studio</a>.</p>



<p>As I have mentioned before <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork </a>was my daily driver when it comes to git GUIs. Unfortunately there is no Linux version of it. I gave <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken </a>a go but it feels very slow, bloated and you have to create and account to use it… It does not feel like a computer program, but more like a Startup-y SaaS-y thing. Then I found out about <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/">Sublime Merge</a> and I was pleasantly surprised that it does a very fine job. User interface is very different to popular git GUIs but it’s fast and reliable. </p>



<h2>bash vs zsh</h2>



<p>I try to keep thigs as default as that makes migrating from one computer to another computer very easy. I tweak very few things in my IDE. Just the default light theme and Vim emulation mode. In terminal, I try to use the default terminal application of the operating system. </p>



<p>One of the major things I was not using in default was my shell. I always used zsh and oh-my-zsh. I have no recollection how I got to use them. I guess they looked cool and oh my zsh made it easy to extend things. This time I wanted to go the other way and decided to stick with bash as that is the default shell for Ubuntu and MacOS. I don’t do shell scripting so zsh’s features around shell scripting goes above my head. </p>



<p>I started by opening up the default .bashrc that comes with Ubuntu. Boy, that thing is <a href="https://gist.github.com/marioBonales/1637696">bloated</a>. I did my reasearch and <a href="https://github.com/raicem/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc">deleted most of the things</a> that come with it. </p>



<p>One thing I can’t live without is the git branch on prompt. There is really no need to install “zsh” just to get that. It’s just a one Google search away. As a plus you get to learn a bit of bash scripting, what is a “prompt”, what is PS1 and all that.</p>



<h2>Small Cuts</h2>



<p>Terminal, commonly used apps, development environment… Those are the big points you think about when you migrate from one operating system to the other. I have managed to find my comfortable setup there as I have explained above. </p>



<p>However, there are other types of things that you don’t really think about before making the migration. I refer to them as small cuts. You don’t generally plan for them but they hurt your day to day flow. </p>



<p>Here are some of them.</p>



<p><strong>Preview</strong>: I miss this software everyday. It’s dead simple to highlight stuff on images/screenshots, sign documents, resize photos and lots of other stuff. Losing this app hurts a lot. I’m sure there is a great online editor out there but I have yet to find it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>There are plenty of DevOps myths&nbsp;circulating the developers’&nbsp;community. This is no surprise, considering how much excitement the DevOps concept has brought&nbsp;over the recent years.</p>



<p>The DevOps methodology can provide significant positive effects for organizations when implemented properly. It can <strong>lower costs, boost efficiency</strong>, and <strong>make the work of development teams more streamlined</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in order to grasp the strength of this&nbsp;process, it is necessary to recognize what DevOps represents. That’s why, in this article, we address some of the most popular DevOps myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 1: DevOps is all about CI/CD&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s the same thing as CI/CD. The truth is that continuous integration and delivery are <strong>the key components of DevOps</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DevOps focuses on the culture and responsibility in a team. It emphasizes the need for everyone on the team to take part in each other’s tasks. This improves <strong>collaboration and communication</strong> in the team.</p>



<p>On the other hand, CI/CD enables this culture with software and tools that emphasize automation. You can see them as <strong>a means to an end</strong>.</p>



<h2>Myth 2: DevOps means NoOps</h2>



<p>NoOps describes the concept where the cloud infrastructure is so automated, that there is no need to manage it.</p>



<p>NoOps is considered as<strong> the next evolution of DevOps</strong> as a development model. Just like DevOps, its goal is to improve software delivery, but by allowing developers to focus on application development instead of infrastructure and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, you can automate the setup, deployment, and monitoring processes, getting closer to NoOps.</p>



<h2>Myth 3: Automation eliminates all bottlenecks&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Automation is one of the biggest benefits that DevOps provides. But <strong>it’s not a silver bullet</strong> that will solve all your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A continuous delivery process enables teams to roll out new features quickly. And, get the feedback they need really fast. This, of course, means that you have to ensure the product’s quality. Moreover, you have to take care of how well it runs and its performance when scaling. You also need to ensure smooth production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automating your CI/CD pipelines helps <strong>eliminate the bottlenecks between code commit and deploy.</strong> But, this is just one stage of the software delivery process. Unless developers and testers are in a partnership, you won’t be able to resolve all your problems. It’s likely that you’ll only move any bottlenecks to another stream.</p>



<h2>Myth 4: One-size-fits-all continuous delivery pipeline</h2>



<p>The idea that you can have one process that fits all teams and companies is impossible, contrary to popular belief. Every organization has <strong>different needs and requirements</strong>. Even projects in the same organization need different continuous delivery pipelines.</p>



<p>You can have projects that need only two to three environments. For example, development, test, and production environments with frequent deployments. Another project can require more environments since it has multiple stages in the software delivery cycle.</p>



<p>This is why the continuous delivery pipeline should <strong>represent the release process</strong> that the company is already using.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 5: DevOps is all about tools</h2>



<p>Conversations about DevOps are mostly focused around which tools your company is using. They then turn into philosophical battles about what are the best tools. Instead, we should be <strong>communicating about the bigger picture</strong>, the business value DevOps brings to your company.</p>



<p>DevOps means focusing on <strong>culture, mindset, and how individuals work together.</strong> Only after should you be choosing the right tools for your processes. Teams often look in the large ecosystem of tools trying to find the perfect solution at the beginnings. They build DevOps pipelines for a very long time, that should be redone once completed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a87265a6-4a4d-4905-97e9-4129ac78563c/Atlassian%20DevOps%20Trends%20Survey%202020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlassian research</a> showed that the two main factors to implement DevOps successfully are <strong>the right tools and the right people</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>DevOps automation tools like <a href="https://microtica.com/">Microtica</a> allow you to create pipelines and test them in hours.</strong> With these kinds of tools, you can save months of work on pipelines that might not function. </p>



<h2>Myth 6: Software release is the same as in Amazon/Facebook/Google</h2>



<p>Many world-leading companies have adopted DevOps for its benefits and flexibility. Looking at these company’s success stories, we, of course, look up to their achievements. We do this without realizing their context and the steps they made to become that successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing is for sure – these organizations <strong>chose and built the tools and processes that worked best for them at the time</strong>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to follow these organizations. Moreover, what they did won’t magically work for our business as well.</p>



<p>We should learn from them and find new ways to innovate and grow. Explore and find the right processes and tools that define our problem space. What will bring <strong>success to our particular business</strong>? This is what DevOps is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 7: Release all the time</h2>



<p>The idea of frequent releases has companies worried about not releasing their software continuously enough. <em>“Ship often”</em> has become the industry standard. However, this doesn’t specify the time. It may be every two to three weeks, or it may be several times a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing is that you achieve the<strong> team confidence</strong> that enables you to release new software when required. CD is the <strong>ability to release code from the main branch and feel confident in it</strong>. The idea of DevOps is that your code should be releasable anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So remember, continuous delivery doesn’t mean you should release as often as you can but gives you the ability to release <strong>as often as you want.</strong> <em>How often should be up to your company’s decision.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>We hope this&nbsp;article helped you bust some of the most popular DevOps myths that&nbsp;swirl around. Don’t let such misunderstandings hinder the progress of your team. Implementing DevOps can help your company improve productivity and create better products, so don’t miss out on these benefits due to these DevOps myths. </p>

<p>Be honest: how often do you use Stack Overflow, Mozilla Developer Network, or some other online resource? How effective would you be without these resources? I know my strength as developer is in understanding concepts and solving problems, not in memorizing APIs and algorithms. <strong>So why do we test developers on their ability to come up with solutions without help?</strong></p>

<p>If you really want to evaluate candidates on the skills they will use in their job, you have two options.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-the-dependence-on-memorization">Reducing the dependence on memorization</h2>

<p>First, you can test a candidate’s problem solving skills. But if you do so, think about how developers actually solve high-level problems. The goal of this type of problem solving isn’t to end up with working code, but set a direction for the architecture. That’s why this type of interview problem is well-suited for system design interviews.</p>

<p>If you must write code, pick simple algorithms the candidate would actually develop on their own. Make sure APIs and syntax aren’t part of the evaluation. In my experience, candidates often gravitate toward using Java or Python, but make it clear you’ll accept pseudo-code. The structure of the solution is important, not the exact characters on the screen.</p>

<p>Finally, consider participating in <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/03/16/were-in-it-together.html">a back-and-forth with the candidate</a>. After all, most problem solving of this type happens collaboratively.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-internet">Use the internet!</h2>

<p>But all of this, is skirting around the real issue with contrived interview problems: developers don’t really work like this. So, I suggest letting candidates <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/05/04/the-project-interview.html">work on a real-world problem</a>, and <strong>let them have access to the internet</strong>!</p>

<p>“But won’t candidates be able to cheat?!” A developer’s strength is in synthesizing solutions to the problems at hand. This entails mapping those problems to standard patterns they’ve seen, drawing inspiration from multiple sources, then putting it all together to solving the unique problem present at your company. Give candidates access to information, and see how they use it.</p>

<hr>

<p>To effectively evaluate candidates on the skills they’ll need on the job, let them work the same way they would after being hired. This means giving them access to the building blocks they’ll use to solve your company’s problems. After all, what good is it to hire someone who knows a piece of trivia but can’t actually apply it?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0690890445953831c024"><div><p><em>Trigger warning: authoritarianism, state surveillance, the Holocaust. If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts. Feel free to reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/this2shallgrow" target="_blank">me</a> on Twitter. Part 2 will be available next week, with a list of the privacy and security tools we frequently use and recommend.</p><p>If you’re looking for a UX researcher or UX designer to work in the privacy and security sphere, I’d love to have a chat with you! </p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Building a real-world application requires a lot of work and a lot of skills other than technology if you want to set up something sustainable. Marketing, Sales, Analytics, and even Accounting are skills needed next to the engineering side to build a real-world application. A real-world application involves a product or app that has some users. But the good news is that you can be a user as well. That should be easy, right? But now the problems arise. What should I build that I will use myself and how to create it? This blog article will set some light on this process by showcasing how I deal with several steps to building real-world apps. As a small reference, I built <a href="https://caseconverter.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caseconverter.pro</a>, a simple case converter, think of PascalCase to camelCase, and <a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getworkrecognized.com</a>, a Work Achievement Tracker with the functionality to create Brag Documents or Self-Reviews, over the last year. If I was able to create these two apps or products, you can do so too!</p>

<p>I have seen many Software Engineers failing with this. I think it is buried in our mentality sometimes. Software Engineers are different from the common population. Some like to focus on the coding part, and others love to focus on the product. Gergely Orosz wrote an excellent article about the <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product-minded engineer</a> and how they differ from "classical" software engineers. I observed that these Product-minded engineers have an easier way to find product opportunities. But that is just my observation.</p>
<p>So what is my process of finding problems to be solved? That’s quite easy. First of all, I do not actively look for a product opportunity. I just live my normal life. I have a full-time job. And you will see so many problems at any job. Try to observe your current job and see if you do any repetitive tasks. For me, an example was creating the Self-Reviews of myself at work. I could not remember what I did the last six months and needed to look up everything with the funky JIRA search. It did not go so well, to be honest. Consistently tracking your work and tagging the work achievements should work. So I built an app for this.</p>
<p>A secret tip of mine: Check the Google Sheets or Excel tables you have at your work and see if it could be built with an easier-to-use interface like a web application. And if your company has this problem, other companies likely have these problems as well. But this should get figured out later.</p>
<p>Normally, I keep track of these things in a simple Google Keep Note. Just write down the problem in a simple one sentence. Write the ideas down for some time, and you should have at least ten ideas written down to continue. Now it is a question of what to choose. More on this later.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-ways"><a href="#alternative-ways" aria-label="alternative ways permalink"></a>Alternative ways</h3>
<p>There are, of course, many alternative ways on how to find ideas. What I have seen working as well is checking existing applications. For example, you can choose one of the apps in the App or Play Store and check the bad ratings and try to look for something that did not work for the customer. Maybe the product was wrongly targeted, or the functionality is just bad. Figure this out and write down the idea in your backlog of ideas.</p>
<p>Another possible idea-finding practice is to be on the lookout of local startups in other regions or languages. For example, there is a product called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/thechurchco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Church Co</a>, which is a website builder for churches. They are on Indiehackers and have quite a huge amount of revenue. That could be applied to local markets like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, or others as well. Just localize the idea and bring it online. Products like these exist in masses already, but it does prohibit you from trying. Another example could be <a href="https://www.xing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xing</a>. It is the german LinkedIn and is even registered on the stock market.</p>

<p>One of the expectations you should set before this whole process is if you want to build a proper startup or just a side project. You can switch, of course, but the initial affords might be given to different topics depending on which path you choose.</p>
<h3 id="the-business-route"><a href="#the-business-route" aria-label="the business route permalink"></a>The Business Route</h3>
<p>Once you have found a problem, you need to validate it. Everyone loves money, so you need to think about monetization now. Your idea needs to generate money, and that is why you need to validate potential monetization touchpoints. That can be super different for every use case. Most of the products we build these days are subscription-based businesses. But it could be different for anything. To validate this behavior, you can throw a simple landing page together. The landing page should include the simple value propositions to the customers and one call-to-action that lets users enter their email. These emails are golden. You should manually interact with them and ask more about their problems and if they are willing to pay. You will soon figure out if it is worth it to build a product around it or not. Getting initial users on your landing page is simple marketing. You won’t have a huge amount of backlinks. So try to get into communities that might need your tool and have questions regarding this. For example, with the Church Co localized copy, you could join some Facebook groups and make a simple survey to ask churches if they have a website and if they would like more functionalities. Bring them in the end to your landing page and let them enter their email.
By responding to related communities consistently, you will also get credibility in the domain. That is important. You need to build an audience you can sell to later. This process can take time. So do not give up after just a few days. Keep poking and trying. Once you validated that the idea is worth some money, you can start implementing it. The technical details will be described in the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-side-project-route"><a href="#the-technical-side-project-route" aria-label="the technical side project route permalink"></a>The technical Side Project Route</h3>
<p>This route is the route most Software Engineers take. They do not validate their product in the first place and just build it. Maybe they will use it but no one else. That is also a win for sure but might not generate any money. Of course, the projects will look good on the resume. Especially if you have a lot of space, but otherwise it comes down to your mindset on what to focus on. Money or the cause of the application. If the money is an unimportant part for you, then just build. Success might follow if you build consistently and also start to do the Marketing and Sales afterward.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-involved-in-an-app-or-product"><a href="#what-is-involved-in-an-app-or-product" aria-label="what is involved in an app or product permalink"></a>What is involved in an App or Product?</h2>
<p>Normally an app or product consists of different things. All of them have a backend or application code and an interface. The interface can be created in different ways. A CLI or API is also just an interface, but most products have a Web-Frontend or a mobile application. If data is saved a backend is also needed for most use cases, especially databases. Typically a landing page and several other resources regarding marketing and sales are required as well. These are the basic parts that you need to get working initially to have a local development environment and a public presence.
On another note, you might need several other things like domain names, a server, the infrastructure around this, a remote database, an email, and many more things. For example, all social media accounts should be registered with the preferred name of your product app. And a lot of other things that have to be done.
Once you have figured out all components needed to build the app, we can start building the app.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-app"><a href="#building-the-app" aria-label="building the app permalink"></a>Building the App</h2>
<p>The creation of the software is probably the most important step for Software Engineers. If you have an interface, you can have a prototype for your idea. The prototype can vary from a User Interface mockup to even just a simple interview with potential customers with a hand-drawn User Interface. The further you go into the step, the more work is invested, but you will also receive more direct feedback that you can act on. In general, keep things as simple as possible. Software Engineers often try to overcomplicate things, trying to deliver a fully functioning app without validating. Step by step.</p>
<h3 id="find-a-name"><a href="#find-a-name" aria-label="find a name permalink"></a>Find a Name</h3>
<p>A name is important for every product or business. Customers identify with the product and brand of the application. A name will probably help with this. Finding the name is not hard. If you want a simple name just use the combination of the target keyword for your product and append a random animal. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>SurveyAnt</li>
<li>FeedbackFish</li>
<li>BannerBear</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. There are many more examples of doing it like this.</p>

<p>One thing that should be checked additionally is the availability of the URL and all relevant social media channels like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. There might be many more channels you want to have, but this is a personal decision.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface-design"><a href="#user-interface-design" aria-label="user interface design permalink"></a>User Interface Design</h3>
<p>User Interface design involves a lot of parts. Some Software Engineers are quite good at everything and even know how to design well. I can recommend reading the book <a href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Refactoring UI"</a> that will give you small recipes and patterns to follow on how to create good designs.</p>
<p>The first part where User Interface design gets important is the landing page. Fortunately, the Open Source world delivers some landing page designs that you can copy and change a bit like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cruip/open-react-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cruip/open-react-template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/issaafalkattan/React-Landing-Page-Template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/issaafalkattan/React-Landing-Page-Template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hermanya/react-landing-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Hermanya/react-landing-page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If these do not fit your style, you can build them yourself. If you need design inspiration, you can also check <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dribbble</a>. It is an excellent website to get idea inspirations (or copy the designs).</p>
<p>After this is completed, you can start finding the design process of your actual application. The color schema of the app needs to be decided, and several basic components can be defined. The basic components can be used from one of the open-source design systems to give you a headstart. You can find a collection on this repository: <a href="https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems</a></p>

<p>Recently I began writing a post on ways to automate python scripts passively.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> For the purpose of the post I chose cron, an operating system utility that is run as a daemon—a program that runs passively in the background of a computer. If cron and daemon both seem etymologically Greek to you, they did to me as well. Researching whether this was true (it probably is) led me down an interdisciplinary rabbit-hole of computer science history and its relationship to philosophy and economics. This first post is an extended history on origin of time-sharing computers, which I couldn’t stop researching. In future a post, I plan on writing more about the economics of cloud computing. Eventually the article ends with the etymology of the term daemon and its meaning both in and outside of computer science.</p>



<p>In the early 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> was investing in different projects that could be used to fight the Soviets. The agency, only a few years old, had been founded just four months after Sputnik’s October 1957 launch. Its <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/creation-of-darpa">express mission</a> was to maintain the US’s technological (military) superiority over other nations. With an initial <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23406949">budget of $400 million dollars</a> (about $3.7 billion in 2020 dollars), the agency had few limits.</p>

<p>One such project that received ARPA funding was the politically named Project MAC (Mathematics and Computation) out of MIT. Established by computer scientists Robert Fano and Fernando José Corbató in 1963, by calling the endeavor Project MAC <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Project-Mac">Fano and Corbató were able to attract researchers from existing labs</a> without anyone’s loyalties (or funding) being questioned.</p>



<p>Project MAC had multiple objectives, but its main focus was Corbató’s previous work on time-sharing systems. Though many strides in computer hardware and software had been made over the previous decade—the invention of the compiler<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, the use of the transistor computer<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and the creation of FORTRAN, LISP, and COBOL<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>—there were still struggles. Despite all the progress computing had made in the previous decade, compute-time—actually using the computer—remained cumbersome.</p>

<p>For efficiency, batch-processing was used for computation: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/Time-sharing-and-minicomputers">decks of punch cards featuring multiple programs were encoded onto magnetic tape</a> and fed by an operator into a central computer for iterative processing. But while a computer read the program, <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/wya/AcademicComputing/text/earlytimesharing.html">its central processor remained idle: a waste of precious compute-time</a>. And, if errors occurred in a program itself, then hours had to be taken to debug it by hand.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Even when the code was actually fixed, a program still had to be rewritten onto a new magnetic strip and subsequently rescheduled by an operator for computation. So frustrating was this process that <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/punched-cards/2/211/2253">in 1967 students at Stanford took to producing</a> a humorous (if dated) short film about the matter.</p>


<p>In recognizing how burdensome compute times were, Corbató laid out his plans for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090906104446/http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/">“the improvement of man-machine interaction by a process called time-sharing”</a> in a 1962 paper submitted to the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP). Like many computer science-related projects of the time, time-sharing was a concept that emerged from military operations. In the late 1950s, the North American Air Defense Command (later known as NORAD) had begun operating a first-of-its-kind network of IBM-manufactured computers connected to near real-time radar data. The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air-defense system was unique, not only its capacity to detect Soviet missiles, but also <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/nets/timesharing.htm">in its ability to programmatically loop through its systems in as little as 2.5 seconds</a>. John McCarthy, a computer scientist from MIT who had seen a prototype of SAGE, was inspired enough to conceptualize a similarly fast system to be used by multiple programmers at once. <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html">In a memo sent out to the MIT community, McCarthy outlined how such a shared-system would work</a>. Corbató, picking up the mantle, aimed to make tangible such a system. But, as so often happens with the popular usage of terms in computer science, even trying to communicate what Corbató meant by time-sharing became confusing.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Corabtó explained the multiple meanings of time-sharing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090906104446/http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/">his 1962 paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One can mean using different parts of the hardware at the same time for different tasks, or one can mean several persons making use of the computer at the same time. The first meaning, often called multiprogramming, is oriented towards hardware efficiency in the sense of attempting to attain complete utilization of all components. The second meaning of time-sharing, which is meant here, is primarily concerned with the efficiency of persons trying to use a computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the SAGE system which was a feat of multiprogramming, Corbató aimed to make real the latter definition with Project MAC. And, with the wind at their back and ARPA funding in their pockets, Corbató and his colleagues were able to succeed in this, compiling new commercially viable hardware and software systems such that multiple individuals could seamlesly submit code to a central processor. Users would access a mainframe computer remotely via their very own typewriter console. Constantly running in the background would be a multilevel queuing routine which would schedule program calls by priority: determining whether a submitted program was a foreground process or a background process. Once queued, these programs would then be operated by a Round-Robin algorithm<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> that ran queued programs for set slices of time, in this case approximately .2 seconds, which Corbató estimated was the speed of human reactivity.</p>

<p>An example of the Round-Robin algorithm can be seen in the first chart below. Given a program  that takes  seconds to run, each program is run for a length of time . If <span> p &gt; q</span> then after  seconds  is paused, sent back to the queue with time  left, and set to continue running once it reaches the head of the queue again. This process continues until all programs in the queue have fully completed. The benefits of the Round-Robin algorithm, and why it was used with the advent of time-sharing computers, was the priority response time took in computing, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched.pdf">where response time is the time difference between when a programmer enters a program into a queue and when it begins to first run.</a> Recall that programmers wanted to start their programs as soon as possible in order to reduce CPU idle time. As can be seen, as the slice of time decreases to the left of the x-axis, the number of iterations—or loops through the queue—increase exponentially on the y-axis. As the length of the time slice increases to the right of the x-axis the number of iterations decrease on the y-axis. This is the case for all three different programs of length 10, 35, and 100 seconds.</p>

<p>Now for a larger example. We will make an extremely simple "messenger". The messenger is a program which allows users to log in on different nodes and send simple messages to each other.</p>
<p>Before we start, let's note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This example will just show the message passing logic no attempt at all has been made to provide a nice graphical user interface - this can of course also be done in LFE - but that's another tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sort of problem can be solved more easily if you use the facilities in OTP, which will also provide methods for updating code on the fly etc. But again, that's another tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first program we write will contain some inadequacies as regards handling of nodes which disappear, we will correct these in a later version of the program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will set up the messenger by allowing "clients" to connect to a central server and say who and where they are. I.e. a user won't need to know the name of the Erlang node where another user is located to send a message.</p>
<p>File <code>messenger.lfe</code>:</p>
<pre><code>;;; Message passing utility.
;;; User interface:
;;; (logon name)
;;;     One user at a time can log in from each Erlang node in the
;;;     system messenger: and choose a suitable name. If the name
;;;     is already logged in at another node or if someone else is
;;;     already logged in at the same node, login will be rejected
;;;     with a suitable error message.
;;; (logoff)
;;;     Logs off anybody at at node
;;; (message to-name message)
;;;     sends message to to-name. Error messages if the user of this
;;;     function is not logged on or if to-name is not logged on at
;;;     any node.
;;;
;;; One node in the network of Erlang nodes runs a server which maintains
;;; data about the logged on users. The server is registered as "messenger"
;;; Each node where there is a user logged on runs a client process registered
;;; as "mess-client"
;;;
;;; Protocol between the client processes and the server
;;; ----------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'logon user-name)
;;; Reply #(messenger stop user-exists-at-other-node) stops the client
;;; Reply #(messenger logged-on) logon was successful
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'logoff)
;;; Reply: #(messenger logged-off)
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'logoff)
;;; Reply: no reply
;;;
;;; To server: (tuple client-pid 'message-to to-name message) send a message
;;; Reply: #(messenger stop you-are-not-logged-on) stops the client
;;; Reply: #(messenger receiver-not-found) no user with this name logged on
;;; Reply: #(messenger sent) message has been sent (but no guarantee)

;;; To client: (tuple 'message-from name message)

</code></pre>
<p>To use this program you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure the server_node() function</li>
<li>copy the compiled code (<code>essenger.beam</code> to the directory on each computer where you start Erlang.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example of use of this program, I have started nodes on four different computers, but if you don't have that many machines available on your network, you could start up several nodes on the same machine.</p>
<p>We start up four Erlang nodes, messenger@super, c1@bilbo, c2@kosken, c3@gollum.</p>
<p>First we start up a the server at messenger@super:</p>
<pre><code>(messenger@super)lfe&gt; (messenger:start-server)
true
</code></pre>
<p>Now Peter logs on at c1@bilbo:</p>
<pre><code>(c1@bilbo)lfe&gt; (messenger:logon 'peter)
true
logged-on
</code></pre>
<p>James logs on at c2@kosken:</p>
<pre><code>(c2@kosken)lfe&gt; (messenger:logon 'james)
true
logged-on
</code></pre>
<p>and Fred logs on at c3@gollum:</p>
<pre><code>(c3@gollum)lfe&gt; (messenger:logon 'fred)
true
logged-on
</code></pre>
<p>Now Peter sends Fred a message:</p>
<pre><code>(c1@bilbo)lfe&gt; (messenger:message 'fred "hello")
ok
sent
</code></pre>
<p>And Fred receives the message and sends a message to Peter and logs off:</p>
<pre><code>Message from peter: "hello"
(c3@gollum)lfe&gt; (messenger:message 'peter "go away, I'm busy")
ok
sent
(c3@gollum)lfe&gt; (messenger:logoff)
logoff
</code></pre>
<p>James now tries to send a message to Fred:</p>
<pre><code>(c2@kosken)lfe&gt; (messenger:message 'fred "peter doesn't like you")
ok
receiver-not-found
</code></pre>
<p>But this fails as Fred has already logged off.</p>
<p>First let's look at some of the new concepts we have introduced.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the <code>server-transfer</code> function, one with four arguments (<code>server-transfer/4</code>) and one with five (<code>server_transfer/5</code>). These are regarded by LFE as two separate functions.</p>
<p>Note how we write the <code>server</code> function so that it calls itself, <code>(server user-list)</code> and thus creates a loop. The Erlang-LFE compiler is "clever" and optimises the code so that this really is a sort of loop and not a proper function call. But this only works if there is no code after the call, otherwise the compiler will expect the call to return and make a proper function call. This would result in the process getting bigger and bigger for every loop.</p>
<p>We use functions in the <code>lists</code> module. This is a very useful module and a study of the manual page is recommended (erl -man lists). <code>(lists:keymember key position lists)</code> looks through a list of tuples and looks at <code>position</code> in each tuple to see if it is the same as <code>key</code>. The first element is position 1. If it finds a tuple where the element at <code>position</code> is the same as <code>key</code>, it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (lists:keymember 'a 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
true
&gt; (lists:keymember 'p 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
false
</code></pre>
<p><code>lists:keydelete</code> works in the same way but deletes the first tuple found (if any) and returns the remaining list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (lists:keymember 'a 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(q r s))
</code></pre>
<p><code>lists:keyfind</code> is like <code>lists:keymember</code>, but it returns the tuple found or the atom <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; (lists:keyfind 'a 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
#(b a c)
&gt; (lists:keyfind 'p 2 '(#(x y z) #(b b b) #(b a c) #(q r s)))
false
</code></pre>

<p> Just yesterday, the book <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a> gave me a swift kick in the pants with this quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>For unpleasant tasks, imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.</p><cite>Rob Fitzpatrick, “The Mom Test”</cite></blockquote>



<p>I immediately fell in love with this concept. Let’s dig into it by first looking up the definition of the word “delegate”:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>delegate: </strong><em>verb</em> – entrust (a task or responsibility) to another person, typically one who is less senior than oneself</p><cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite></blockquote>



<p>That last part is key. If I’m giving a task to someone less senior than me, I lay it out with subtasks and any other info they may need.</p>



<p>This jives well with a favorite philosophy of mine, which is that <em>I should treat future-me as another person</em>. It’s like, when I’m staying at someone else’s house, I’m more likely to pick up after myself and make my bed and generally be super respectful. If I treat future-me as another person, I can trick my brain into doing all those things for myself.</p>



<p>So to delegate something to myself, what I’m really doing is treating future-me as a different, less senior person. I’m <em>tricking my brain into doing some planning</em> for this unpleasant task, which makes it much less unpleasant when I’m actually doing it. I’m being more respectful to future-me.</p>



<p>For example, say I need new tires. Instead of just putting “new tires” on my todo list, I can delegate it (to myself). When I’m delegating to someone less senior, I probably want to split it up into specific subtasks, like:</p>



<ul><li>Call tire shop (867-5309)</li><li>Make an appointment to bring in my car</li><li>Block off my calendar during that time</li></ul>



<p>My favorite todo list app Amazing Marvin calls these types of tasks “tasty tasks”:</p>



<blockquote><p>A tasty task is one that you immediately want to do when you look at it. This happens when it’s super clear what the task entails and you feel confident that you can actually complete the task.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.amazingmarvin.com/three-simple-rules-writing-great-tasks-to-do-list/">Amazing Marvin blog</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>See how “Call tire shop (867-5309)” is a tastier task than just “New tires”? That’s one reason I love this self delegation concept.</p>



<p>The other reason I love it is that it makes me less likely to take lazy shortcuts. If I wouldn’t tolerate those shortcuts from the person I delegate the work to, then I can’t tolerate them from myself either.</p>



<p> So watch me crack the whip on myself! Observe as I put myself to work and don’t take no crap from myself!</p>



<blockquote><p>Anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, alright?</p><cite>Dwight Schrute</cite></blockquote>

<p>Good news on the adoption of <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/smtp-tls-reporting">SMTP TLS reporting</a>: since the 25th of August 2020, we are seeing SMTP TLS reports being sent by Microsoft!</p>
<p>After Google, Comcast, and SocketLabs, Microsoft is now the fourth major email service that is sending <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8460" target="_blank" rel="external">RFC8460</a> SMTP TLS reports. </p>
<p>The support for SMTP TLS reporting from Microsoft did come as a bit of a surprise to us, as Microsoft is the only major email provider that is not yet sending <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/dmarc">DMARC</a> reports.
Nonetheless, would we like to thank Microsoft for embracing this standard, and massive congratulations to the developers at Microsoft who made this possible!</p>

<p>We are excited to see the adoption of SMTP TLS reporting growing steadily, as TLS related email issues are hard to monitor. SMTP TLS reporting also paves the way for broad adoption of <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/mta-sts">MTA-STS</a>.</p>

        <hr>
            <div>
                <div><p>SMTP TLS reporting is a reporting standard for email, which informs you about any TLS related issues that a sender might experience when trying to deliver email to your domain. This includes SMTP-over-TLS (STARTTLS), MTA-STS, DNSSEC and DANE.</p><p>&nbsp;Mailhardener aggregates SMTP TLS reports and informs you when TLS related delivery issues are reported.</p></div>

<p>After decades of work, scientists used Chandrayaan 1 and NASA’s LCROSS to finally discover water on the Moon in 2009. In the 10 years since, the next step has been to understand the exact nature of and the amount of water the Moon hosts. This is where NASA’s LRO and <a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">ISRO’s Chandrayaan 2 orbiter</a> come in.</p>



<p>For most of the 20th century, scientists argued the Moon’s surface was bone-dry. The 382 kg of rock and soil samples the Apollo missions brought from the Moon to Earth attested to this. When they did find traces of water in the samples, scientists dismissed them as contamination. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, so any water on its surface is exposed directly to the vacuum of space, and evaporates. And due to the Moon’s low gravity, water vapor quickly escapes into space.</p>



<p>However, there are certain regions on the Moon that haven’t received sunlight for more than a billion years, and where scientists think the water can be. On the lunar poles, the Sun is very close to the local horizon throughout the day so even a small feature, like a rock, can cast very long shadows. Likewise, large craters with terraced edges can easily block sunlight from entering the crater, so sunlight is blocked a full 360°. Such places are eternally dark and are called permanently shadowed regions (PSRs).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11556-psrs-nasa-lro.gif?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="338" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Permanently shadowed regions on the lunar south pole, highlighted in blue. <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4043">Credit: NASA LRO</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>But where could the water have come from?</p>



<p>Scientists know that comets and many types of asteroids contain water. For most of the Solar System’s existence, these objects have been bombarding planets and their moons at a vigorous pace. This is why the Moon is covered in craters, and scientists think the asteroids and comets responsible for them could have deposited water on the Moon. They have proposed that some fraction of this water could have found its way into PSRs, where – like sitting inside a refrigerator – they could’ve been preserved for billions of years.</p>



<p>In 1994, NASA launched the Clementine lunar orbiter. Its <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1994-004A-09">Bistatic Radar Experiment</a> beamed radio signals straight into the PSRs. The signals bounced off the PSRs and were received by ground stations on Earth. Scientists found the nature of the reflected signals to be consistent with water ice, although they couldn’t be 100% sure.</p>



<p>NASA sent another orbiter in 1998, called the Lunar Prospector, to find out if there was water ice in the PSRs. Its neutron spectrometer found that the number of neutrons in the soil corresponded with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/14apr_moonwater.html">presence of hydrogen atoms</a>. Could these hydrogen atoms be part of water molecules?</p>



<p>Armed with Clementine and Lunar Prospector data, scientists were almost certain that there was water on the Moon, but they needed to be absolutely sure.</p>



<h3>Water on the Moon indeed</h3>



<p>In 2008, India forayed into planetary exploration with the Chandrayaan 1 lunar orbiter, for which ISRO <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/1704.pdf">solicited instruments</a> from scientists around the world. NASA pitched and built two of these, named MiniSAR and M3.</p>



<p>The Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">also found</a> that the PSRs reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice, from more than 40 polar craters. But just like with Clementine, the data wasn’t 100% certain.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1204" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?resize=1200%2C1204&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3), an infrared spectrometer, would go on to clinch the prize. M3 detected not just water in the PSRs but <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">could also differentiate between ice, liquid water and water vapor</a> based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. M3 confirmed that the Moon hosted water once and for all.</p>

<p>The Chandrayaan 1 orbiter also carried an impact probe – a craft that intentionally crashed near a PSR on the Moon’s south pole. As it descended, its mass spectrometer instrument <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2430.html">detected water molecules</a> in the thin but persistent lunar atmosphere.</p>



<p>However, ISRO didn’t publish the results until NASA announced that Mini-SAR and M3 had discovered lunar water. ISRO then <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/MIP-detected-water-on-Moon-way-back-in-June-ISRO-Chairman/article16883362.ece">claimed</a> that their instrument had detected water on the Moon first.</p>



<h3>Not that dry</h3>



<p>All this time, scientists had been developing ideas about how the Moon could have water on other parts as well, not just at or near the poles. The Sun emits a constant stream of protons, some of which strike the Moon. Most of these protons are reflected into space but some are absorbed. Scientists thought the oxygen in the soil could interact with the absorbed protons to produce water, and that they should be able to detect the water molecules from orbit.</p>



<p>NASA’s Cassini spacecraft flew by the Moon in 1999, en route to Saturn. Its infrared spectrometer <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">found water-bearing minerals</a> at most latitudes on the Moon, with a higher concentration at the poles.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/b0d3d-cassini-moon-water.jpg?resize=392%2C295&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="392" height="295" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Detection of water-bearing and hydroxyl-bearing minerals on the Moon by Cassini’s infrared spectrometer. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The results were in stark contrast to the bone-dry Apollo samples. One reason could be that most Apollo landing sites were near the equator, so high daytime temperatures at these sites might have evaporated the water. However, they didn’t publish the findings for a decade, until Chandrayaan 1 happened.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s instrument onboard Chandrayaan 1, SARA, analyzed protons reflected by the lunar surface. Like Cassini, SARA <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091015091605.htm">found water/hydroxyl groups</a> in the lunar soil. The discovery proved timely for ESA’s BepiColombo mission to study Mercury, which carries two similar instruments for detecting water. Chandrayaan 1’s M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon too.</p>



<p>In addition to water ice in the PSRs and water molecules in the lunar soil, M3 found a third water source, which came as a surprise. M3 had imaged the Bullialdus crater, one of the many large craters that boast central mountains. These mountains contain material excavated from deep within the Moon’s crust.</p>







<p>M3 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130220235318/http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/38_Klima_NLSI_2012.pdf">found water-bearing minerals</a> in the central mountain but not in the area surrounding it. These traces of water provided informed scientists’ ideas about the Moon’s interior.</p>



<p>Scientists now knew that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions. Note that it’s still less water than the driest deserts on Earth. However, the PSRs on the lunar poles host appreciably more water.</p>



<h3>LRO and Chandrayaan 2</h3>



<p>In 2009, NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). It also <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4043">detected water ice on the lunar poles</a> using both the onboard radar and the <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4057">neutron spectrometer</a>. LRO has been orbiting the Moon for over 10 years now, longer than any other orbiter. The LRO team has published an extensive <a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/psr">atlas of PSRs</a>, laying the groundwork for future exploration and settlement on the Moon.</p>



<p>Like Chandrayaan 1’s impact probe, LRO carried an impactor too, called LCROSS. In 2009, its upper stage deliberately impacted one of the PSRs on the lunar south pole. The other half of LCROSS followed and studied the plume of moondust the crash kicked up. It was found to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Sci...330..463C/abstract">contain 155 kg of water</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>From this result, scientists estimated all the PSRs together contained <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">more than 600 billion kg</a> of water ice, equivalent to at least 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">Chandrayaan 2 orbiter</a>’s instruments intend to extend our knowledge of water on the Moon. They include an enhanced infrared spectrometer and an upgraded radar, called the DFSAR.</p>



<p>The infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and determine which water-bearing minerals are present. Chandrayaan 2’s long-term observations aim to discern how the water content in the lunar soil changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The DFSAR will map the water ice in the PSRs. With twice as much penetration depth and higher resolution, DFSAR will quantify the amount of water trapped in these cold regions, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h3>What’s next?</h3>



<p>The lunar science and exploration communities agree that we can harness water ice on the Moon for future lunar habitats. Using solar power generated by the habitats, we can also split the water ice into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel. To that end, Blue Origin, the spaceflight company owned by Jeff Bezos, has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-new-tipping-point-partnerships-for-moon-and-mars-technologies">snagged a $10 million NASA contract</a> for their lunar lander.</p>



<p>But before we plan habitats at the Moon’s poles, we need to know more about the nature of water ice in these regions. The LRO and the Chandrayaan 2 orbiters are expected to fill these gaps.</p>



<p>ISRO has stated that Chandrayaan 2 will orbit the Moon for seven years and that should be ample time to fully map and quantify water on the lunar surface. However, let’s not forget that Chandrayaan 1 had a design life of two years but failed after only 10 months.</p>



<p>Surface missions that explore PSRs, like NASA’s upcoming <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-viper-lunar-rover-to-map-water-ice-on-the-moon">VIPER</a> rover, are the next logical step towards sustainable habitats on the Moon. As we develop technologies that tap into water ice, we can <a href="https://jatan.space/the-moon-as-a-rocket-platform/">settle on not just the Moon but the whole solar system</a>. We should be glad our nearest neighbor has plenty of it; we can’t keep dragging everything out of Earth’s gravitational pull for eternity.</p>

The proposal to introduce secret contracts to mainnet will be made on <strong>September 8th, 2020.</strong> If passed by the community, the secret contracts network upgrade would take place on <strong>September 15th, 2020.</strong></p><p id="108d">This proposed upgrade would make Secret Network<strong> the first layer-one blockchain to enable general purpose private computation across a distributed system of nodes equipped with secure enclaves. </strong>For the first time, developers will be able to build and deploy “secret” smart contracts that can utilize encrypted inputs, outputs, and state. At the same time, we’re building connections to Ethereum, Cosmos Hub, and other networks, intending to bring our capacity for “programmable privacy” to the entire blockchain universe.</p><blockquote><p id="770d"><em>Simply put: </em><strong><em>Secret Network brings privacy to public blockchains.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="2a96">Essentially, Secret Contracts enable anyone to use their private data in decentralized applications without revealing the raw data.<strong> Data being used in computations throughout Secret Network simply can’t be public.</strong></p><p id="b1c3">This event is the culmination of years of research and development work. The Enigma development team has worked tirelessly to bring this functionality to the Secret Network blockchain, and after a series of successful testnets, it is time to bring secret contracts fully into the world.</p><p id="c05d">Read on to learn more about secret contracts, a brief history of recent progress in our community, what’s launching now (secret tokens!) and what happens next.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="dc5c">The vision of the decentralized web is to create a more user-centric and sustainable internet of value. Applications built on distributed networks enjoy the benefit of being robust, unstoppable, censorship-resistant, and transparent. For this reason, blockchains have been a key piece of the decentralized web vision.</p><p id="3bf0">But all blockchains, and by extension smart contracts deployed on them, have one glaring and near-fatal problem — <em>all data stored on them is public.</em><strong> In that sense, traditional blockchains are worse than anything that came before them.</strong> Instead of trusting a single organization (e.g., Facebook, Google, your bank, etc.) with your data, now you have to trust everyone. For all intents and purposes, data on the blockchain becomes public domain.</p><p id="7661">But what if you could program smart contracts that not only solved for correctness, but also for privacy? What if you could have encrypted inputs and outputs as well as network state, keeping it hidden from all parties, including the nodes executing the smart contract? With these new types of contracts, users and applications can operate in an environment where it’s safe to include sensitive data, which most real-world use cases require. This is the concept of “secret” smart contracts that Secret Network introduces.</p><p id="38b3"><a href="https://blog.scrt.network/programmable-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret contracts allow for programmable privacy,</a> allowing for arbitrarily complex data privacy controls to be implemented inside applications. The flexible encryption capabilities and controls offered by programmable privacy unlock the potential value of the decentralized web.<strong> It allows for privacy how you want, for anything you want, when you want it, and from whom you want it.</strong></p><p id="f96c"><strong>Learn more in this </strong><a href="https://blog.scrt.network/programmable-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>blog post</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p id="5891">The Secret Network was launched in February 2020 by over twenty independent validators from the existing community of Enigma. At the time, the network was known as the <em>Enigma Blockchain. </em>The network is based on Tendermint / Cosmos SDK and features a native coin — Secret (SCRT) — used for staking, governance, and network fees. Today, Secret Network has over forty active mainnet validators!</p><p id="7b0e">In May, a proposal was made to <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/introducing-secret-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebrand the network as “Secret Network.”</a> This proposal passed with unanimous approval on May 17th, 2020. The logic behind this naming was simple: with concepts like secret nodes and secret contracts well established in the ecosystem, and with a native coin known as SCRT, it was only natural to align the network’s branding entirely around “Secret.” Plus, since the project was now being supported by many independent entities and not a single development company, the community felt the network’s naming should reflect this fact.</p><p id="ad5f"><a href="https://youtu.be/Jk7kV1ph-FQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But as we explained in a recent video</a>, there’s a deeper meaning behind the word “secret” — one that is very resonant for our community.</p><blockquote><p id="27f1"><em>A secret is something that you don’t want to share with everyone, but still want to share with people you choose to trust. A secret is something that you want to keep protected — not because it’s something bad, but because it’s something valuable. We call this network “Secret” because it allows developers and users to protect valuable data while still enabling them to share and compute it when, how, and with whomever they choose. </em>Secret Network is where these important concepts of privacy, freedom, and consent coincide.</p></blockquote><p id="5094">In June, we reached another exciting milestone: <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-contracts-update-milestone-3-of-3-is-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the completion of code for secret contracts!</a> This allows CosmWasm smart contracts to run with encryption inside secure enclaves, making the magic of secret contracts possible.</p><p id="8551">With the completion of this code, we launched the <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/announcing-the-secret-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Games</a> in July — a series of incentivized testnets designed to test secret contracts in the wild! We split this into two phases: <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-games-update-testnet-phase-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase 1,</a> an invitation-only testnet capped at fifteen participants, and <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-games-update-incentivized-testnet-phase-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase 2,</a> open to all participants! Phase 1 brought incredible participation and feedback from many experienced and talented validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, Dokia Capital, Iqlusion, Outlier Ventures, Chainflow, Hashquark, B-Harvest, Mitera BV, and more. Phase 2 has been a huge success, with <a href="https://explorer.pub.testnet.enigma.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 80 validators connecting to the testnet</a>.</p><p id="bc45">These testnets allowed validators not only to get valuable experience supporting Secret Network, but also with deploying and utilizing secret contracts. Participants played “Secret Hold’em,” entered a “Secret Raffle,” and tested out “Secret Tokens” (more on this below).</p><p id="53f3">We’re excited to say that these testnets have not uncovered any critical unaddressed issues, which means we are ready to move to our most critical milestone for secret contracts: <strong>integration with the Secret Network mainnet.</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3512/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png" width="1756" height="1170" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*akaE4wZen11cC1C4.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="c976">The Enigma development team plans to make an <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-network-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-chain proposal</a> on September 8th, 2020 to upgrade the network to include secret contracts. If this proposal has reached approval after the usual seven day voting period has expired, <strong>secret contracts will be LIVE on Secret Network on September 15th, 2020!</strong></p><p id="3786">With this launch our attention will turn to mass adoption: onboarding new secret contract developers, secret node operators, and community members who are passionate about securing and scaling the nascent decentralized web. With the support of the Secret Foundation and community committees, we will be working to produce more educational materials and documentation that help expand our ecosystem and build more bridges to the rest of the blockchain universe!</p><p id="a446">Excitingly, we will be launching some of the first secret contracts alongside this mainnet upgrade, including “<a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-tokens-programmable-privacy-for-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secret tokens.</a>” This is a powerful idea that applies our network’s capability for “<a href="https://blog.scrt.network/programmable-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">programmable privacy</a>” to the world of decentralized finance. <strong>Secret tokens are programmable, privacy-preserving tokens — programmable like ERC20s, but private like zCash. Most importantly,</strong> <strong>secret tokens create network effects for privacy, providing the missing piece for DeFi mass adoption</strong>.</p><p id="ea94">With secret tokens, each DeFi user actually gains more privacy with each additional DeFi service and every dollar worth of additional value locked in the ecosystem, leading to privacy network effects. The reason for this is that the aggregate liquidity across all DeFi applications directly quantifies the level of privacy you obtain (this is also known as the anonymity set). Think about these privacy gains like vaccination: the more people who inoculate themselves by using Secret Network to protect their privacy, the more benefits everyone else in the Secret DeFi ecosystem can gain.</p><p id="46db">Our first implementation of secret tokens allows you to deposit X amount of SCRT (which is not private by itself) and instead obtain X amount of “secretSCRT” — the privacy-preserving Secret Token version of SCRT. The same could be done for any asset in the Cosmos ecosystem utilizing IBC, and in the future could support assets from Ethereum and other ecosystems.</p><p id="ce4b">Learn more <a href="https://blog.scrt.network/secret-tokens-programmable-privacy-for-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>:</p><p id="3093">After the mainnet upgrade, the Enigma development team and the Secret Network ecosystem will be focusing on adding products and functionality that strengthen the position of the Secret Network in supporting the decentralized web. We’ve been actively exploring some key products related to our expansion of the Secret DeFi ecosystem, and there’s already working code on internal testnets. You can expect these to be announced and explored on the Secret Blog in the near future!</p><p id="6f52">You may be wondering whether we expect an explosion of native assets on the Secret Network. While that’s a long-term goal for us, in the short-run, we are focused on building bridges to Ethereum, Cosmos Hub, and other blockchain ecosystems. <strong>One of Secret Network’s primary advantages is its interoperability.</strong> These bridges will allow assets in other ecosystems to be turned into privacy tokens based on the SecretToken standard, allowing us to bring programmable privacy to Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. This will enable privacy preserving synthetic assets on Secret Network, such as secretETH, secretDAI and secretATOM to be used in DeFi products and utilized with full privacy.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="4912">We now must give a huge thank you to every community member who has been a part of this long and challenging journey to the present …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Bloomberg) --Germanyâ€™s blame game over Wirecard AGâ€™s collapse is focusing in on the question of why authorities failed to take a harder look at the payments company before it became the countryâ€™s biggest accounting scandal in living memory.</p>

<p>Lawmakers are questioning a top adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Berlin before grilling financial industry watchdogs the following day as the fraud that burned investors engulfs the countryâ€™s political establishment. If the hearings go badly, parliament may start a deeper investigation as the country prepares for the post-Merkel era with an election due next year.</p>

<p>Wirecardâ€™s crash from rising star to national disgrace has undermined the countryâ€™s reputation as a reliable place to do business and delivered a major blow to its fragile base of retail investors. While the government is taking action to prevent a repeat, authorities have struggled to dispel the impression that they were more focused on protecting Wirecard than investigating allegations of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>â€œWirecard had a strong political lobby that reached all the way into the chancellery,â€� Florian Toncar, a member of the opposition Free Democrats, told reporters Monday before the hearing. â€œThere have been such failings at the core of financial supervision that a full parliamentary inquiry will be necessary.â€�</p>

<p>At the heart of the issue is whether German officials knowingly turned a blind eye because of the prospects of establishing a home-grown technology leader. Wirecard boasted that it would revolutionize payments with faster electronic transactions and more services for consumers and companies.</p>

<p>Those ambitions collapsed when it filed for insolvency in June after saying that a quarter of its balance sheet didnâ€™t exist. German prosecutors subsequently said that Wirecardâ€™s 3.2 billion euros (US$3.8 billion) of debt are most likely lost. The scandal has drawn comparisons to FlowTex Technologie GmbH, which caused 1.8 billion euros of damage by selling non-existent drilling systems to leasing companies in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The committee will also address why German anti-money laundering authorities didnâ€™t follow up on notifications involving Wirecard. The countryâ€™s Financial Intelligence Unit told the government earlier this month that itâ€™s re-examining more than 1,000 reports of suspicious activity involving Wirecard since June 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Close Connections</strong></p>

<p>The highlight on the first day of the hearing of parliamentâ€™s finance committee is testimony by Merkelâ€™s chief economic adviser, Lars-Hendrik Roeller, who rarely speaks publicly. He was the point person for the chancelleryâ€™s contact with Wirecard and will certainly be pressed on why Merkel promoted the companyâ€™s efforts to gain a Chinese license during a state visit in September 2019, even as allegations of irregularities swirled.</p>

<p>That support was part of broader efforts to get China to open its financial system and wouldnâ€™t have been provided if the government knew what it does today, Hendrik Hoppenstedt, a state minister in Merkelâ€™s office, told the committee Monday.</p>

<p>The issues surrounding Wirecard are a â€œheavy burdenâ€� for Germany as a financial center and need to be cleared up comprehensively, he said, according to parliamentâ€™s newsletter.</p>

<p>There are also issues relating to Merkelâ€™s interactions with Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. In preparations for her trip to China, Merkel met with her former defense secretary, who resigned in disgrace in 2011 over plagiarism allegations, and discussed Wirecard. There are also concerns about the role German political insiders may have played in facilitating contacts for Wirecard.</p>

<p>Lawmakers also delved into what officials may have known about Jan Marsalek and his connections. The former Wirecard executive is at large and under the protection of the Russian secret service, Handelsblatt reported.</p>

<p>â€œWe learned that German intelligence services didnâ€™t have any information about Wirecardâ€™s work with international intelligence agencies,â€� Lisa Paus, a member of the opposition Greens party told reporters. â€œIâ€™m surprised how naive they were.â€�</p>

<p>Lawmakers from the parties that make up the government were also critical.</p>

<p>â€œThere are signs of striking failures at the Finance Ministry and the regulator,â€� said Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the CSU, the Bavarian sister party of Merkelâ€™s CDU.</p>

<p>Michelbach said Merkelâ€™s conservative bloc will decide whether a deeper investigation is necessary after the second day of hearings. The two parties hold the largest number of seats in parliament.</p>

<p>Senior officials from German financial watchdog BaFin and the Bundesbank will be in the hot seat on Tuesday. The focus then is likely to be on why they decided in 2017 that Wirecard was a technology company rather than a financial firm, allowing most of its operations to escape scrutiny by BaFin, which only directly oversees banks and insurers.</p>

<p><strong>Lacking Oversight</strong></p>

<p>BaFin has sought to head off criticism by saying that reclassifying Wirecard wouldnâ€™t have helped much in unearthing the fraud because it would have still relied on the companyâ€™s audited accounts. Still, lawmakers may ask BaFin President Felix Hufeld why his institutionâ€™s probes of Wirecardâ€™s banking unit failed to point to problems at the wider company.</p>

<p>Hufeld had a rocky time after an earlier hearing in July -- Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier were also called to testify -- and will probably be focused on getting the facts across more clearly while defending BaFinâ€™s actions.</p>

<p>The Bundesbank, whose role was largely limited to supporting BaFin in its oversight, was drawn deeper into the scandal with the disclosure this month that former Wirecard Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun met with a senior official at Germanyâ€™s central bank last year. While it isnâ€™t clear what was discussed, the meeting is a reminder of Wirecardâ€™s connections to the countryâ€™s top decision makers.</p>

							<p>Forget regulators. Consumer groups and campaigners who want to see their GDPR complaints wrapped up in a timely manner are increasingly turning to Europe's court system for results.</p>
<p>A nonprofit group is planning to <a href="https://globaldatareview.com/data-privacy/parents-urged-hand-over-details-tiktok-class-action" target="_blank">sue Chinese-owned app TikTok</a> in a Dutch court as EU regulators squabble over who has jurisdiction over the company. Oracle and Salesforce face <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1433676">legal complaints over privacy</a> in the U.K. and the Netherlands. And while the U.K. data regulator has spent more than a year grappling over a planned £99 million fine against hotel chain Marriott, a complainant has now <a href="https://www.martinbryant.net/marriott-data-breach-claim/" target="_blank">sued the company</a> over the same privacy breach.</p>
<p>The shift toward lawsuits hints at growing disappointment with a hydra-headed privacy system that counts dozens of EU regulators, but is still struggling to finalize a single major investigation more than two years after the GDPR came online.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1393749">France's regulator hit Google with a €50 million fine</a> in 2019, the grouping of European privacy watchdogs — which is meant to sign off on major regulatory action — has yet to do so for any major tech company despite dozens of open probes.</p>
<p>Much of the criticism lands on the doorstep of Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which is in charge of overseeing many of the biggest Silicon Valley companies. The watchdog finalized its first cross-border investigation of the GDPR era, targeting Twitter, in May. But the terms of that decision, which have not been made public, have triggered a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1437523">formal dispute between regulators</a>, delaying a final outcome by many more months.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Given the delays, this is certainly worth a go"<em> — Michael Veale, British computer scientist and privacy campaigner</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Fed up with delays, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1430736">consumer groups</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-regulator-mismanaged-facebook-privacy-probe-austrian-campaigner-max-schrems/">privacy campaigners</a> are speaking out — and turning to the court system for speedier resolution of their complaints.</p>
<p>"Data protection law is primarily enforced by regulators, who have investigative powers, but in theory can be enforced directly by citizens in courts. Given the delays, this is certainly worth a go," said British computer scientist and privacy campaigner Michael Veale.</p>
<h3>Taking back control</h3>
<p>Rebecca Rumbul, a U.K. researcher and representative for a data protection claim <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1433676">against tech companies Oracle and Salesforce</a>, pointed to a range of weaknesses among regulators as the reason she decided to bring her complaint to the courts.</p>
<p>“They [regulators] don’t have the resources to investigate an individual complaint and take on a massive organization like Oracle,” she said.</p>
<p>It's not just the promise of a speedier resolution that is pushing complainants to shun regulators. Going to court gives them much more control over a case, as well as the ability to set a legal precedent once a verdict is rendered.</p>
<p>Filing a complaint with EU privacy regulators leads to years of wrangling that can end up with cases being bounced to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Regulators can also decide to settle complaints with the companies directly, cutting out the complainants.</p>
<p>"If you go straight to the court, you skip the first step [of going to a regulator], and you retain control over whether or not you settle," said Veale.</p>
<p>Another enticement is the fact that courts, unlike the regulatory process, offer the promise of compensation for victorious parties.</p>
<p>“Regulatory fines do not provide recompense to individuals who had their data stolen,” said Martin Bryant, who recently launched a data breach claim against the Marriott hotel chain. He added that his claim was meant to "complement" regulatory enforcement and act as a "deterrent."</p>
<h3>Next up: Class actions</h3>
<p>Collective legal claims — called class actions — have historically been far less common in Europe than in the United States, where the threshold for launching them tends to be lower. But that could be changing, including for privacy-focused cases.</p>
<p>“The right to claim immaterial damages in combination with mass action mechanisms may well lead to something very similar to a U.S.-style class action culture in Europe,” said German data protection lawyer Tim Wybitul.</p>
<p>He noted that a German court had recently awarded a claimant €5,000 because their former employer, a private company, allegedly failed to properly respond to an access to data request.</p>
<p>Before 2018, many EU jurisdictions did not allow people to claim compensation for data protection violations that did not harm them financially. The GDPR changed that.</p>
<p>The EU is also finalizing a new law called the Collective Redress Directive, which will boost the ability of consumers to bring data protection claims to court.</p>
<p>"EU collective redress rights may give this already explosive situation an additional boost. But in most countries there already are mechanisms in place to bundle claims for immaterial GDPR damages," Wybitul said.</p>

<p>Data breach class actions have also become<em> de rigueur</em> in the U.K., where a London court last year ruled that a case against Google tracking iPhone users could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision and <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=578002fe-476b-4204-a586-0e16c7f50a9f" target="_blank">potentially widening the scope of claims that can be brought under the GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>An April ruling in an English court <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1330995">also left the door open to companies being held liable for data breaches they aren't directly responsible for.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Going directly to court opens up a new front in the fight against data protection abusers, but is not necessarily straightforward.</p>
<p>Courts might not yet be savvy enough to deal with technical data protection questions in the same way as regulators. Companies may choose to throw money at claimants in court rather than follow regulator orders to fix underlying issues with their practices.</p>
<p>Launching a court case also doesn't come cheap. Rumbul's case was only made possible by a litigation funder, for instance. And the influx of for-profit companies also raises questions about the motivation behind claims.</p>
<p>Class actions are a big business in the U.S., and according to Wybitul, European consumer lawyers and litigation funders seem to be waking up to the opportunities offered by claiming immaterial damages under the GDPR.</p>

<p><em>This article is part of a series on </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>When I was writing my <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/">book</a>, I referred to “skip-level meetings” in the text. My copyeditor left me a comment: “What are these? You’ve not mentioned them elsewhere.” It seems that I’ve also <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/performance-reviews/">previously mentioned</a> skip-level meetings <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/managing-through-interfaces/">twice</a> on this website without offering any explanation. I’m sorry about that. It seems that I’ve always assumed that people know what they are. So let’s change that.</p>



<p>Skip-level meetings are typically semi-frequent meetings between staff who have a layer in the org chart separating them. It’s a meeting between someone of a given depth <em>m </em>and another of depth <em>m+2</em>. In more relatable human terms, if you were a manager of managers, then a skip-level meeting might involve you having a meeting with one the individual contributors on your direct report’s team.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f0MYVq4AmQJZbS2ihEyuyOICvEjGvDeXwq0CP0gIEqv9MWwTJDTW4jChZhVUXPcoqfGv8G48L9YB3tmErDvuM0r_x0VS8AwWncsWP7sA7M1i1E5LU-M5d2QI_A6BnefEA4GMjeay" alt=""></figure>



<p>Don’t worry, I can hear you already: “Another article about <em>more meetings?” </em>Well, yes. But skip-level meetings can pay dividends for you as a manager of managers. They build trust and break down barriers. But before we get into why they’re good, explore the frequency that you should do them, and suggest some example topics of conversation, I’d like to remind you of a particular scene in my favourite television show.</p>



<h2>These are for you, McNulty</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/workplace-politics/">previous article</a> about workplace politics, we highlighted that in particularly old-fashioned workplaces, not going through the proper channels can be problematic. But what do I mean about the proper channels? Well, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYuGNpOk5U">particularly memorable scene in The Wire</a> (warning: <em>extremely</em> strong language) where Jimmy McNulty, in his usual casually reckless way, talks to a judge about previous murder cases that he feels did not get solved properly. This results in the judge speaking to the Deputy, and then the Deputy calling the Major into his office to explain the situation that he knew nothing about. Hence all of the swearing and the punishment of all-night report writing.</p>



<p>The org chart – whether on purpose or not – can create the expectation of knowledge boundaries where the “proper” way of sharing information is to send it up and down the chain, as McNulty probably should have done with Rawls. However, we all know that this can be counter-productive, bureaucratic and just plain annoying. Sometimes it’s just easier to talk to the person you need to talk to, even if that person happens to be your manager’s manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why not just have that happening as a regular arrangement? That’s what skip-level meetings are about. You can, with transparency, probe deeper to build rapport, uncover issues, and help your staff grow.</p>



<h2>Benefits</h2>



<p>There’s a number of benefits for having a culture of skip-level meetings, and those benefits are gained at both ends of the skip-level relationship.</p>



<p>Here are some reasons that skip-level meetings are good for you as a manager of managers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>They build rapport with the people in your org.</strong> Although you <em>could</em> <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/managing-through-interfaces/">manage entirely through the interface</a> of your managers, your impact, output and availability as a leader is greatly increased by building strong relationships with those in their teams as well.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They show that you’re just another human.</strong> Sometimes people higher up in the org chart become shrouded in mystery: an important person with a fancy job title that they people aren’t allowed to talk to. However, that’s entirely false. You’re there for them as they fundamentally work for you, so you can show them that you’ve got their back and are open to talk.</li><li><strong>They give you additional insight into how your teams are doing.</strong> You don’t have to wait for performance reviews in order to gather a picture of how your teams are doing. By regularly speaking to the staff on those teams, you can build a better picture of how that team functions by looking at it from above and below.</li><li><strong>You get additional insight into how your direct report is performing. </strong>Related to the above, you can gently probe into how they feel about their peers and their manager and whether they and their team are getting the support that they need to succeed.</li><li><strong>They demonstrate that you value everyone, regardless of their position in the org chart. </strong>By making your time – your most precious commodity – available to more people, you show them that you truly value them. You also show that you don’t entertain politics, where information must always filter through the chain of people in the org chart.</li></ul>



<p>There’s also plenty of benefits for the other member of staff:</p>



<ul><li><strong>They open the door for fairness and transparency.</strong> By knowing that their manager’s manager has time for them, they know that their performance and path at the company isn’t only viewed through the lens of their own manager.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They get an insight into what’s going on in other parts of the department and company.</strong> Being a couple of levels higher in the org chart, you’ll have access to interesting <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/vp-director-what/">operational or strategic</a> information about what’s going on in other teams, forming the bigger picture that they’re part of.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>They get a direct line to give feedback, raise concerns and suggest ideas. </strong>Maybe they’ve got suggestions about people, processes, product and tooling ideas that are beyond the scope of their manager to solve. However, you might be just the right person to pick these up and look into them.</li><li><strong>They demystify what goes on at a leadership level. </strong>They get the opportunity to lift the lid on what happens higher up the org chart by talking to you about what you spend your time on and what’s important. This not only builds rapport, but it gives them an insight into what the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/the-two-tracks-of-growth/">management track</a> might hold for them in the future.</li><li><strong>They allow opportunities for more connections. </strong>You may know many more people in the department, so you could make a mentor or mentee connection across different teams, or introduce them to someone that has been working on similar problems before.</li></ul>



<p>So, hopefully I’ve convinced you that they’re a good idea. Now we should think about the practicalities of doing them.</p>



<h2>How often should you hold them?</h2>



<p>If you have many teams reporting into you, then that’s potentially a lot of people in order to arrange skip-level meetings with. If you’re already having weekly one-to-ones with your direct reports, then you could imagine your calendar becoming even more of a mess than it is already.</p>



<p>A way of tackling this conundrum is to list all of the people that are a skip-level away from you and then bucket them into different meeting intervals depending on the relationship that you want to form with them. I don’t recommend having skip-level meetings weekly, since you’ve already got your direct reports to meet with at that frequency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can consider the following intervals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fortnightly: </strong>A very small percentage of staff should be in this category. Perhaps you have a few superstars that you see growing quickly, or individuals who are at the core of an important initiative for the department that you wish to lend more support to.</li><li><strong>Monthly: </strong>This is a good “normal” cadence. 30 minutes once a month is a good amount of time to check in, catch up and discover what has been going on. Of course, you can always have follow up meetings if anything particularly interesting or worrying arises.</li><li><strong>Quarterly: </strong>Some individuals are less chatty, or may not particularly need or want your time (and you’ll know who these people are based on your initial conversations). Checking in once a quarter makes the arrangement more easy going, and enough time passes since you’ve last met for some topics of conversation to arise.</li><li><strong>Occasionally and/or on request: </strong>And of course, there may be members of your staff that prefer to have as few meetings as possible and may not get huge value from the relationship, and that’s perfectly fine. You can forgo a planned schedule and just let them grab you when they need you, or vice versa.</li></ul>



<p>The intervals that will suit various members of staff with ebb and flow with time, so don’t be afraid to switch it up depending on which projects you have running, or whether particular staff are going through a period of career growth or a difficult time. Be flexible and offer your support where needed, and work with your direct reports to get this information.</p>



<h2>Getting them started</h2>



<p>So, get those skip-level meetings kicked off. Before you start causing panic by booking in meetings without any context, perhaps you could send out something like this, after having let your direct report managers know that you’re going to do it.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Hey everyone,</em> </p><p><em>I’m going to start doing skip-level meetings. There’s no bad reason for doing this, in fact, it’s very much for good reasons: I want to get to know you all better, understand what you’re working on more clearly, and – where I can – help you succeed.</em></p><p><em>What this means is that I’ll be booking in some semi-regular catch-ups where we can have a chat about whatever you want. It can be as formal or as informal as you like.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Perhaps we could talk about what you’re working on and what I’m working on, or what’s coming up in the future for our teams. We could touch on your career progression, or discuss any concerns that you have about your role or the company</em>. </p><p>Y<em>our manager knows that this is going to be happening, so don’t worry about that. Also, if you’d rather not do it because you feel you have enough meetings already, then that’s totally fine! Just let me know. But do know that you can come and chat to me at any time.</em></p><p><em>Best,</em></p><p><em>A. Manager</em></p></blockquote>



<p>This message is written from the viewpoint of a manager getting them underway. But what if you’re an IC and are interested in getting this kicked off? </p>



<p>I’d suggest you start small: speak to your manager about whether you can set up skip-level meetings with <em>their </em>manager. If they’re unsure as to why, then why not just direct them to this article?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’ve been directed to this article because someone would like to do skip-level meetings with you or your manager, what are …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

Late last year, we were faced with the challenge of modernizing our notifications system for end-users by making it fit for both the changing requirements of the industry, and our internal development teams. In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the considerations and learnings we encountered along the way. It will not be a deep dive into the language and its surrounding ecosystem, but instead I’ll offer a glimpse into how we approach language and technology evaluation and adoption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its then current state, our notification system was baked into some older parts of our service ecosystem and heavily resisted far-reaching changes. We also felt that utilising more modern, ubiquitous technologies like WebSockets would suit us better and provide our users with a more engaging experience – and well, let’s just say it had a host of other small problems that made it a prime candidate for a rewrite.</p>
<p>Now a rewrite does not require a change in technologies: we could have stuck to the more or less blessed stack of Node.js/Typescript for our back-end, but we realised an opportunity here try something new in a part of the application that is not necessarily on the hot-path.</p>
<p>In other words, we were in a fairly good position to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>We set off on a scoping and requirements gathering exercise, and managed to draw a circle around the features we wanted to build and deliver in due time. One of the themes that kept creeping up from our discoveries was user experience: the look and feel of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Our goal was to provide a slick, real-time experience to our users. There are a couple of technologies currently available that can facilitate this, but WebSockets was the most mature solution for this. The next steps were to track down some language and framework combinations that have significant support for long-running WebSocket connections.</p>
<p>Apart from UX demands, we also set some expectations from an engineering point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>There need to be strong primitives in the framework - with strong community support - for both building and testing persistent connections, queuing, storage, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If we have to fight the framework, we’re doing it wrong. It should be opinionated enough, <strong>without</strong> getting in the way.</li>
<li>If we can reduce moving parts, we’re doing it right.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these requirements in hand, we opened up the floor for any suggestions and sure enough, one option quite quickly gained traction.</p>
<h3>Why Elixir?</h3>
<p>Elixir is a fairly new language, but it runs on extraordinarily robust and battle-tested concepts and technology, at least by modern-day web development standards. It builds and runs on top of the Erlang VM, doing so — in part — by leveraging Erlang/OTP.</p>
<p>OTP, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Open Telecom Platform</span></a>, is a collection of tools, libraries and middleware that enable developers to build scalable, robust systems. It is the lower-level ecosystem supporting Erlang – and thus Elixir – development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider Elixir to be a niche language, albeit a very mainstream and capable language within that particular niche. It might not be the fastest or most optimized, but it commits to a few core tenets – concurrency, fault tolerance and isolation of errors, persistent connections – and executes on those really well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we selected Elixir based on a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developer Experience – Elixir has a reputation for not only being developer-friendly, but having developer experience and productivity at its core</li>
<li>Integrated feedback loop – Coming from Node.js, having the One True Way to run unit and integration tests, and have a very clean way of running these in parallel is refreshing.</li>
<li>Purpose – As mentioned above, our requirement was to support and build upon a system of near-real time communication. Many other technologies do offer some level of library support, but we were hard-pressed to find a better solution than the primitives and higher level constructs provided by Elixir and Phoenix.</li>
<li>Interest – A very enthusiastic engineer within the team took ownership of this project</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our first steps in Elixir</h3>
<p>Once we had settled on Elixir, we were ready to roll our sleeves and&nbsp; actually start building something. This is where the champion steps in – a person who not only shows interest in the topic but is also willing to coach and mentor their peers. In my experience, it’s quite risky to try to adopt something that no one in the team has any experience in.</p>
<p>In true champion spirit, one of our own team members took ownership of building the seed project. While he was busy tinkering away, we purchased some books, found some tutorials, installed the blessed extensions and started learning this shiny new stack. It did not take long for us to have <em>something</em>; it was missing a lot of functionality, but it was just enough to give us a taste of how the language is structured, how the web framework hangs together and how we deploy it.</p>
<p>Now of course, introducing a new stack is not all smooth sailing. It should come as no surprise that the cost of adopting something new comes with a substantial amount of minutiae that need addressing. We had established ways of running services within our infrastructure, and our job now was to slot our Elixir-based service into that infrastructure.</p>
<p>From getting logging to work, having a working Prometheus endpoint, and integrating with our internal authentication mechanisms – let’s just say we had quite a few boxes to tick in order to get everything to play nicely.</p>
<p>But in the end, we have something that works! So let’s talk about some of our key learnings.</p>
<h4>Clusters within clusters —&nbsp;Understand where Kubernetes ends and Erlang/OTP begins</h4>
<p>There are competing, yet complementary philosophies at play here. The application is running on top of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6Dl0iII9U" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kubernetes within Smartly</span></a>, which brings with it a whole raft of *stuff* – a scheduler, failure detection, logging integration, load balancers... everything <strong>and</strong> the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The application itself is running on top of Erlang/OTP, which in turn drags a fair bit of tooling and opinionation into the fray - failure detection, process management, supervision tree(s). You name it, it’s probably there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Valim</strong>, the creator of Elixir, has written in depth about <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2019/10/kubernetes-and-the-erlang-vm-orchestration-on-the-large-and-the-small/"><span>how these two runtimes coexist</span></a>, and at large, the technical aspect of his argument is sound. But what we’ve observed is that there are a few challenges with regards to expectations that needed to be overcome.</p>
<h4>Failure escalation — Come to grips with how failure occurs and propagates</h4>
<p>Our main competency within the team is running Node.js applications, and while a lot can be said about Node.js, it is not a complex programming model. There’s a script, you run the script, it blows up or keeps on running. Everything else is yours to manage and control.</p>
<p>Elixir really tries <strong>hard</strong> not to crash the entire underlying process, so it will let parts of the application crash and burn, after which the supervisor will reconstruct processes in your supervision tree based on configuration. Kubernetes does <strong>not</strong> get involved here, so our regular approach of finding out bad things are happening simply does not apply.</p>
<p>This happened recently when a critical part of the application was unable to talk to an underlying database, and instead of the usual symptom – pods crashing and burning left, right and centre, making our alerting system go off like nothing else – we were faced with an application that <em>looked functional</em> <em>on the surface</em>, but was heroically trying to stem the flood of dying processes internally. Needless to say, we added more monitoring and learnt our lesson.</p>
<h4>One is the loneliest number — Account for redundancy in a stateful system</h4>
<p>Traditionally, one of the hardest steps to take when scaling your infrastructure is to go from one to two. When vertical scaling is no longer a viable or preferred option, teams need to look at horizontal scaling instead. In the current landscape of Kubernetes clusters and small, disposable services, horizontally scaling your application has even become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>This puts the onus on us to design a system that can work in a distributed way. For all intents and purposes this would be easy if we were planning to run a simple request-response system, but we’re not: we’re aiming to build a distinct-per-user perpetually connected system. So the one thing we really don’t want to deal with is duplicated websocket connections, or having to duplicate our message handling. In short, all copies of our application need to be able to communicate <strong>with one another</strong> and pass user-bound notifications to the copy of the application that has initially established the WebSocket connection to said user.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is not an unsolved problem. Even more fortunately, a solution is provided within <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix</span></a> — the de-facto Elixir web application framework - itself. This solution takes the shape of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix PubSub</span></a>. At its core, this would allow our applications to communicate with one another. If PubSub is the API by which applications would communicate, it does not by itself provide the means by which information makes it from one application to another. This message transport back-end needs to be provided separately, and take the form of <strong>adapters.</strong></p>
<p>There are two adapters currently available, Redis and PG2. We could have chosen Redis, as we do have some expertise in-house on how to run this at scale. But that would have introduced another moving part to the equation, and we were keen to keep as much as we could contained within the application itself. So that brings us to PG2, a solution that leverages Distributed Erlang in allowing Erlang processes to communicate across servers. In order for us to have this ability, we have to lean on one final component within our toolbox, namely <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>libcluster</span></a>. This Erlang clustering …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

				<p>AyeTap is a peer to peer voting service that will make democracy cheaper, more effective and viral. Because democracy today is broken and run by the government, media &amp; lobbyists. Voting today doesn't really improve your school, office, neighborhood or favorite pub because politicians can't change what matters to you, in your space. And online petitions are useless because they are one dimensional. Petitions only tell you how many signed, not how many DIDN'T sign, so you never know what the majority wants because you only see half the picture.</p>
				<p>AyeTap lets people find out what the majority wants ... about anything, because every vote can be validated and traced back to a person in the real world, through a paper (and peer) trial.</p>
				
				<p><strong>We've built AyeTap to give you the power to change your space. Join us and help redefine democracy.</strong></p>

This article will cover few of the common mistakes that we often do while writing HTML. Let's get straight to it.</p>
<h2 id="1-use-of-anchor-elements-lessagreater">1. Use of Anchor Elements: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Anchor elements are used to create a hyperlink to a file or a location of a webpage and should always be used for navigating to a real url. Anchor elements are often misused as fake buttons by setting their <code>href</code> to <code>#</code> to prevent the page from refreshing, then listening for their <code>click</code> events.</p>
<p>When we point <code>href</code> value to <code>#</code>, it breaks the default functionality of a link causing unexpected behavior when opening links in a new tab or window, bookmarking, copying/dragging links, or when JavaScript is loading, errors, or is disabled. They also convey
incorrect semantics to assistive technologies, like screen readers.</p>
<p>If something is supposed to be clickable, it should always be a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code></p>
<p>Using here to add a link is not recommended as it doesn't tell anything about where it's going to navigate. Provide some proper text of where the links point to.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Read more about anchor tag <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">here</a> ❌</p>
<p>Read more about anchor tag on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">w3school guide</a> ✅</p>
<h2 id="2-use-of-break-element-lessbrgreater">2. Use of Break element: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code></h2>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element is used to break the text in an address or while writing poems specifically. Creating separate paragraphs of text using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is not only bad practice, but it is also problematic for people who navigate with the aid of screen reading technology. Screen readers can miss the content between two break elements while still announcing the presence of the tag. This can be frustrating for a person using a screen reader.</p>
<p>Use CSS <code>margin</code> property with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element to add space instead.</p>
<h2 id="3-use-of-heading-elements-lessh1greater">3. Use of Heading elements: <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML is a semantic language and anything regarding visuals should be done with CSS only. Avoid using heading tags to resize text. Instead, use the CSS <code>font-size</code> property. Headings use size to indicate their relative importance, but CSS is preferred for general-purpose resizing.</li>
<li>Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, next use <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and so on.</li>
<li>You should only use one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> per page.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is wrong:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 1<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 3<span>&lt;/<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 4<span>&lt;/<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is appropriate:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 1<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h2</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 2<span>&lt;/<span>h2</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>Heading level 3<span>&lt;/<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="4-use-of-paragraph-lesspgreater">4. Use of Paragraph: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Do not use empty <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements to add space between
paragraphs and it is problematic for people who navigate with screen-reading
technology. Screen readers may announce the paragraph's presence, but
not any content contained within it — because there is none.</p>
<p>If extra space is desired, use CSS properties like <code>margin</code> to create the effect.</p>
<h2 id="5-use-of-aside-lessasidegreater">5. Use of Aside: <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Aside was introduced with HTML5 and represents content that is not directly connected with the main content. Asides are stand-alone, non-essential as part of an article but when used correctly it can be an extra level of information for your content. Example sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
<p>Do not use aside to tag the parenthesized test as that is part of the main content. Don’t try to force content into an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> if it shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>aside</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>Epcot Center<span>&lt;/<span>h4</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>aside</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Writing semantically correct HTML is the responsibility of every developer. I hope you learned something from this article. That's it for now. Take care and stay safe.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/iamshadmirza">Shad</a></p>

The person of Arete is of the highest effectiveness; they use all their faculties — strength, bravery, and wit — to achieve real results. In the Homeric world, then, Arete involves all of the abilities and potentialities available to humans.</blockquote><p>In other words, excellence in action. Excellence is excellent, after all! (Hat tip to my friend <a href="https://morlockpublishing.com/">Travis</a> for Arete specifically.) While I refuse to learn philosophy, I've been told that this is a type of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">"virtue ethics."</a> I consider my preference for Arete to be pragmatism: reality is the litmus test, which is fitting since reality <em>is</em> the litmus test.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Vae victis" means: nobody loses who ought to have won.</p>— uncanny valley girl 🔪 (@leaacta) <a href="https://twitter.com/leaacta/status/1143959912537628674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2019</a></blockquote>

Everything matters, because we feel everything, and thus it matters to us. All of it does — everything that we can know intrigues and excites us, even the endeavor of <em>knowing</em> in the first place.

And as COVID-19 pulls the rug<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statscan-gdo-1.5703354" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statscan-gdo-1.5703354" target="_blank">out from under economic growth</a>, some economists are beginning to face up to the fact that a version of MMT has moved from economic conjecture to economic fact.</p>  <h2><strong>Fear of being complicit</strong></h2>  <p>"The problem we have is that MMT is considered so fringe that many economists are even afraid to talk about it for fear of being viewed as complicit," said Frances Donald, global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management in a phone interview.</p>  <p>But she said refusing to address the reality of what governments and central banks around the world are already doing is a mistake.</p>  <p>"Like it or not, elements of MMT are already so embedded in our economy and financial system since COVID-19 developed that burying our heads in the sand isn't going to help us," said Donald.</p>  <p>Certainly a search for economists to discuss MMT shows Donald is something of a rarity in her forthrightness. Many are reluctant to give the theory credibility, saying things like "but you can't keep on borrowing forever."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-economy-mmt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704126.1598644174!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-economy-mmt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Stephanie Kelton, an economist and author, is the current U.S. guru of modern monetary theory.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Howard Schneider/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Even the current U.S. guru of the theory, Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University in New York and author of the new best seller <em><u><a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-deficit-myth-modern-monetary/9781541736184-item.html?s_campaign=goo-DSA_Books&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1qL6BRCmARIsADV9Jta56xgYY3SpKT45uT__2PNiAx3JfI85eDDKbNdYFBZB1ibR5Xj_Vi8aAsNaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy</a></u></em>, doesn't claim running up the balance sheet is without consequences.</p>  <p>"Generally I feel that MMT has been misunderstood as the idea that budget deficits don't matter and that you can spend as much as you want," said Donald. Instead, she said, the message is that there are more important things to consider&nbsp;—&nbsp;such as jobs&nbsp;—&nbsp;when contemplating when to run a deficit.</p>  <p>Less a concrete list of policies than a lens through which to view the world, Donald said that it is clear spending too much, even under MMT, will eventually lead to inflation. She said&nbsp;that's something Canada must consider as it borrows from the central bank and spends on growing the economy following shutdowns for COVID-19.</p>  <h2><strong>Still 'just wrong'?</strong></h2>  <p>If central banks really can stimulate inflation with low interest rates and the creation of money by buying up government bonds, it would seem that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now on side.</p>  <p>A year and a half ago, Powell called MMT "<u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mmt-fed-budget-1.5035451" target="_blank">just wrong</a></u>," saying, "We are going to have to spend less or raise more revenue."</p>  <p>But that was then. This is now. Last week, the Fed chair made headlines by announcing that the central bank would keep interest rates near zero, even as inflation began to rise, with the idea that job creation was the priority.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-fed.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-fed.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-fed.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-fed.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-fed.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5704127.1598644378!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-fed.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Last year, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell scoffed at MMT. Now he seems to be following its precepts.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Interestingly one of those who seemed reluctant to endorse MMT by name was Scott Aquanno, author of <em><u><a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/bank-of-canada-must-keep-innovating-beyond-pandemic-think-tank-880385421.html" target="_blank">The Bank of Canada and Crisis Management: COVID-19 and Beyond</a></u></em> and a strong supporter of the central bank's bond buying program.</p>  <p>Among his recommendations is the <u><a href="https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2020/05/Bank%20of%20Canada%20and%20crisis%20management.pdf" target="_blank">formation of a public bank</a></u> to lend to groups and projects that would be unlikely to get money through normal banking channels in spite of rock bottom interest rates. And as for&nbsp;inflation, he said&nbsp;it remains far, far away.</p>  <p>"I think what you might see, paradoxically, is a situation where the Bank of Canada is essentially printing billions of dollars to fund government debt and deficits but that inflation declines,"&nbsp;Aquanno said in a telephone interview.</p>    <p>If Canada were the only one doing this, the loonie would likely lose value, he said. But as countries around the world all do the same thing, so long as the Canadian central bank doesn't get ahead of the pack, there is little to worry about.</p>  <p>Aquanno, an assistant professor at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, a city that has watched GM jobs melt away, believes the lack of wage inflation is simply a matter of 40 years where labour lost bargaining power to businesses that have been able to move jobs abroad.</p>  <p>Mark Kamstra, a finance professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto, generally takes a more traditional view of economics, but even he sees some of the remedies prescribed by MMT as appropriate for a very unusual malaise.</p>  <h2><strong>Ideological divide </strong></h2>  <p>Certainly the term MMT has been politicized in the United States as its star advocate, Kelton, appeared on stage with left-leaning Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.</p>  <p>While many traditional private sector advocates may dislike the heavy hand of government on the economy, cheap money and government-led investment may be the best option at this point, said Kamstra.</p>  <p>Low interest rates create zombie companies that might otherwise be displaced by more deserving players, said the York University economist. But pushing them out of business now would result in economic collapse and deflation. Like Frances Donald, he is certain this is no time for austerity.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;Ottawa expects $343-billion deficit because of pandemic:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>The federal government expects a $343-billion deficit this year and for millions of Canadians to remain out of work because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:10</span></span></span></p>  <p>Like Aquanno, though for different reasons, he thinks inflation will be hard to generate despite low rates and cash injections in Canada's service-led economy.</p>  <p>"If people had a lot of money they might get their hair cut twice a week instead of once a month," said Kamstra doubtfully.</p>  <p>Injecting money into the economy may increase demand, he said. But this demand would be for goods such as iPhones and cars often&nbsp;made by cheap foreign labour. These products don't face shortages, so there is&nbsp;so little inflationary pressure.</p>    <p>As to governments creating jobs on green projects or infrastructure, in normal times, that could well steal away resources needed in the private sector.&nbsp;But in an economy shattered by COVID-19, that's not a problem right now right, said Kamstra.</p>  <p>"It's a good time for the government to start thinking about how it can safely employ resources to fix problems."</p>  <p>And as we desperately look for ways of digging the economy out of the hole created by the global coronavirus lockdown, that applies whether we decide to call it MMT or something else.</p>  <p><em>Follow Don on Twitter <u><a href="https://twitter.com/don_pittis" target="_blank">@don_pittis</a></u></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><a title="Bubblewrap Security Headlines podcast" href="https://anchor.fm/firo-solutions/episodes/Security-Headlines-bubblewrap-podcast-special-eitlb9">
<img alt="bubblewrap security headlines podcast sandbox" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/bubblewrap.png">
</a></p><p>In modern stacks, a large chunk of applications run in container environments<br>
such as docker and systemd-nspawn.  However, these applications are not built for security.<br>
The security community has proven it again and again that privilege escalation attacks<br>
are very serious with attacks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW">Dirty Cow</a> and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3135">CVE-2016-3135</a>.</p>

<p>A way to tackle the problems of running applications with a low privilege user without<br>
that application being able to interact with other running applications is to use <em>user namespaces</em>.<br>
Using user namespaces you can hide process id’s to the applications and provide a more sandboxed environment.</p>

<p>Alex wanted to the distribution of multiplatform applications easy
which led him to sandboxing and namespaces, today he<br>
maintains the “chroot on steroids” project <em>bubblewrap</em> which is a sandbox platform for running<br>
sandboxed applications in different namespaces.</p>

<p>Alex is also a long time user of Linux, with 20 years working for Redhat.<br>
He started to code on the commodore 64 and has been a developer ever since. In school he<br>
got introduced to Solaris and jumped deeper and deeper into Linux rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Working on Linux allows Alex to work from home in the suburbs of Stockholm<br>
and work on programs that get used by a global user base.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about how it has been to work on sandboxed<br>
desktop applications and how flatpak has grown.</p>

<p>So far there a has been a handful of different CVE’s for bubblewrap
that we talk about.</p>

<p>Flatpak has gotten bigger and bigger and “flathub” has come to see the light
, flathub is a place where all Linux users can get sandboxed desktop
applications.</p>

<p>More and more developers are publishing their apps on flathub, the<br>
Mozilla team has even picked up on it and are currently shipping firefox throw it.</p>

<p>Flathub is running on a stable Rust backend, Alex picked Rust to be the backend as one of his first larger Rust projects.<br>
We of course talk about how Rust is becoming more part of our daily lives<br>
as more and more applications are being ported to it, like librsvg journey from being written in C to now being a rust code base, as well as libraries<br>
being written in Rust.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining an application with a graphical user interface and you target
an audience that is running Linux on the desktop, we recommend<br>
that you get your application on flathub.<br>
Here is a guide on how you can do that:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission">https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission</a></p>

<p>This podcast was made possible with running zoom with flatpak:</p>

<pre><code>$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo   
$ flatpak install flathub us.zoom.Zoom 
$ flatpak run us.zoom.Zoom
</code></pre>

</span></p><h2 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition"><a href="#the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition" aria-label="the pragmatic programmer 20th anniversary edition permalink"></a>The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The first edition of this book was released in 1999 and has become one of the most important books to read for software developers.</p><p>Last year, 20 years after its initial release, the authors released a new edition of this book, not only including updates of the code examples,
but also integrating the feedback they gathered at this time.</p><p>While the book contains code samples, it's not about teaching you how to code: The authors explain how to improve the <em>process</em> of developing software in a pragmatic way.
It includes plenty of tips that will help you throughout your programming career.</p><p>Some of the traits of pragmatic programmers are their <em>attitude</em> and philosophy of approaching
problems, placing them in its larger context, and taking <em>responsibility</em> for everything that they do.</p><p>I've only read the book 3 years into my career as a software developer, but
I'm sure that I will be able to appreciate the book, even more, when I read it again in a year or so.</p><p>I'd recommend it to all software developers who are serious about improving their skills.
However, while it contains a lot of useful advice, I feel like if you're just starting out with
programming, you might not come to appreciate all the wisdom that the book offers.</p><p>If you want to buy the book, you can get it <a href="https://amzn.to/2D4Nf4K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here on Amazon</a> (affiliate link).</p><h2 id="favorite-topics"><a href="#favorite-topics" aria-label="favorite topics permalink"></a>Favorite topics</h2><p>The Pragmatic Programmer has a total of 53 topics. As with any non-fiction book, some ideas resonate with the reader and others don't.</p><p>I want to share a short summary of each of my favorite topics here and how I integrated them into my work. These are the topics that I liked the most after reading
the book for the first time, but I'm sure that if I read the book again a few years from now, my takeaways will be different.</p><ul><li><a href="#its-your-life">It's your life</a></li><li><a href="#knowledge-portfolio">Knowledge portfolio</a></li><li><a href="#orthogonality">Orthogonality</a></li><li><a href="#tracer-bullets">Tracer bullets</a></li><li><a href="#the-basic-tools">The basic tools</a></li><li><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies">Dead programs tell no lies</a></li><li><a href="#programming-by-coincidence">Programming by coincidence</a></li><li><a href="#test-to-code">Test to code</a></li><li><a href="#pragmatic-starter-kit">Pragmatic starter kit</a></li></ul><undefined></undefined><h3 id="its-your-life"><a href="#its-your-life" aria-label="its your life permalink"></a>It's your life</h3><p>This topic is at the very beginning of the book and has a motivational vibe to it. Many developers that Dave and Andi have talked to
are frustrated with their jobs or the technology they're working with.</p><p>The authors highlight the fact that software development is one of the best careers to have nowadays since developers usually are well paid, can
work from anywhere in the world, and have a lot of freedom in their jobs.</p><p>If you're not happy with the job you're working right now, you can try to fix it by talking to your boss or find yourself another job easily.</p><p>Given how privileged software developers are, there's no excuse for not living the life you want. If you're proactive
and stay on top of your game, you'll be rewarded with a lot of opportunities by the industry.</p><h3 id="knowledge-portfolio"><a href="#knowledge-portfolio" aria-label="knowledge portfolio permalink"></a>Knowledge portfolio</h3><p>The knowledge portfolio of every developer is like a regular investment portfolio: If you invest in it regularly, you will reap the benefits of
that later on.</p><p>I found this analogy to be the most powerful in this book since I read it at a time where I wasn't developing my programming skills any further
and I felt like I was hitting a glass ceiling. I wasn't investing in my knowledge portfolio and I came to a point where I noticed the results of that.</p><p>Regularly investing in yourself by reading non-fiction books will help you stay curious and
motivated about your profession (they don't have to be all programming related).</p><p>It also helps to discover more things that you don't know, making <em>Unknown</em> Unknowns, <em>Known</em> Unknowns. This idea is not from the book, but I think it is related.</p><p>The more you learn about a certain topic, the more you see the complexity in it and the more you see the little you know about it.
You can read more about this in this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-knowns-and-unknowns-framework-for-design-thinking-6537787de2c5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Medium post</a>.</p><p>The authors suggest you invest in your portfolio by doing the following things:</p><ul><li>Learn at least one new language every year</li><li>Read a technical book each month</li><li>Read nontechnical books, too</li><li>Take classes</li><li>Participate in local user groups and meetups</li><li>Stay current (by reading news and posts online)</li></ul><p>You don't have to do all of them, but consistently developing yourself with these suggestions will definitely help you expand your portfolio.</p><blockquote><p>To get notified about articles like this one, <a href="https://felixgerschau.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subscribe to my email newsletter</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="orthogonality"><a href="#orthogonality" aria-label="orthogonality permalink"></a>Orthogonality</h3><p>This is a term borrowed from geometry. We probably know this concept under names like <strong>modularity</strong> or <strong>layered systems</strong>. In the end, all of them refer to a system
whose components are loosely coupled, meaning that the components don't have a lot of dependencies.</p><p>In orthogonal systems, it's easy to change one component without the fear of breaking something on the other end. These systems are also easier to test.</p><p>Thinking about orthogonality during the development or design stage of a system can help a lot in making the system easier to work with in the future and prevent bugs.</p><h3 id="tracer-bullets"><a href="#tracer-bullets" aria-label="tracer bullets permalink"></a>Tracer bullets</h3><p>In the shooting scenes of any action movie, you can often see the path of the bullets. Bullets that mark the path they've taken are called <em>tracer bullets</em>.</p><p>Tracer bullets are used in real-world combat as well because they help to aim under difficult environments by providing <strong>immediate feedback under real circumstances</strong>.
They are not supposed to hit the target right away, but the fast feedback allows the gunner to adjust the aim.</p><p>The equivalent in software development is to <strong>get a small part of the system working as soon as possible</strong> and asking for feedback from users and stakeholders.</p><p>Advantages of the tracer bullet approach are:</p><ul><li><p>Early and visible results for your users and sponsors.</p></li><li><p>Developers have a structure to build upon.</p></li><li><p>The project becomes an <strong>integration platform</strong>:</p><p>New changes are integrated into an already working system.</p></li></ul><p>The alternative to the "tracer bullet approach" would be writing each module of the system separately, connecting them in the end together, and test the whole
system at the very end of the project.</p><p>Tracer bullets aren't meant to be prototypes. They're meant to get a stable version of a feature or aspect of the final system that will be the backbone for future developments.</p><p>Just like with the bullets, you won't always hit the target at your first shot. Users or stakeholders might not like the result, but the whole idea of this is to
get this feedback at the beginning of the project rather than at the end.</p><h3 id="the-basic-tools"><a href="#the-basic-tools" aria-label="the basic tools permalink"></a>The basic tools</h3><p>This chapter of the book contains an overview of the tools that every programmer should use. The authors compare programming tools to the tools of a woodworker,
which also inspired the cover of the book.</p><p>Woodworkers use a variety of tools, each of them having its specific purpose. They use tools like rules, drills, clamps, and many more.
The woodworker knows when to use which tools and has mastered how to use it.</p><p>In programming, we have our own tools that we need to get the job done. These tools amplify our talent by increasing productivity.</p><p>In the book, they advise against the usage of a single power tool, an IDE, and encourage you to use the tools that an IDE uses behind the scenes.</p><p>The tools covered in the book fall into the following categories:</p><ul><li>The power of plain text</li><li>Shell games (Unix commands)</li><li>Version control</li><li>Power Editing (Your text editor)</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Engineering daybooks</li></ul><h4 id="dont-rely-on-gui-environments"><a href="#dont-rely-on-gui-environments" aria-label="dont rely on gui environments permalink"></a>Don't rely on GUI environments</h4><p>Unix commands are so powerful because each of them has one single purpose and they can be combined through pipes, which
opens up an infinite amount of possibilities to what you can do with them. It's to the programmer what the workbench is to the woodworker.</p><p>Using the shell allows you to automate things and combine commands in such a flexible way that GUIs can't keep up with.</p><h3 id="dead-programs-tell-no-lies"><a href="#dead-programs-tell-no-lies" aria-label="dead programs tell no lies permalink"></a>Dead programs tell no lies</h3><p><em>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</em></p><p>The tip of the authors for this topic is to <strong>crash early</strong>.</p><p>Why? Because if you don't, your program will maybe <em>look</em> like it's working correctly but returns slightly wrong results due to the system being in
a wrong state.</p><p>You can avoid this by crashing early and often. This will help you to find the root of the bug faster and it will be more apparent when something is wrong with
the program.</p><p>Wrapping your code in <code>try catch</code> statements might keep the program running, but the subtle bugs that are the result of that are much harder to catch.</p><blockquote><h4 id="data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree"><a href="#data-validation-in-mobx-state-tree" aria-label="data validation in mobx state tree permalink"></a>Data validation in Mobx-State-Tree</h4><p>This is one of the aspects I like about <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mobx-State-Tree</a>, a frontend state management tool.
It crashes early by validating the data before adding it to the store that contains all the data on the fronted.</p><p>At first, this seemed annoying to me, since the app crashed as soon as the backend returned the wrong data. After giving it a second thought, this approach is
much better than keeping the program running.</p><p>The alternative would be that, after receiving an unexpected null value, for example, the app crashes anyway
because I'm trying to read a property from <code>undefined</code> (JavaScript equivalent to a NullPointerException).</p><p>Having worked with it for nearly 2 years now, I can say that with this helped me on multiple occasions to track down bugs faster than it would've taken me
without validating the data.</p></blockquote><h3 id="programming-by-coincidence"><a href="#programming-by-coincidence" aria-label="programming by coincidence permalink"></a>Programming by coincidence</h3><p><em>Don't assume it, prove it.</em></p><p>Programming by coincidence means that you're making guesses about the functions and interfaces that you're using. It might work for a while, but since you
don't <strong>know</strong> what you're working with, bugs can show up, which will be difficult to track down later on.</p><p>The result is that, whether your code is working or not, you don't know <em>why</em>.</p><p>As a remedy to programming by coincidence, you shouldn't guess what's the purpose of a given interface but read the documentation. If you can't rely on the documentation,
or there isn't one to begin with, document (and test) your assumptions.</p><p>I found the advice of this topic to be helpful when working on projects with a messy codebase where functions would have unexpected side effects.</p><h3 id="test-to-code"><a href="#test-to-code" aria-label="test to code permalink"></a>Test to code</h3><p><em>Testing is not about finding bugs.</em></p><p>This topic is all about testing and why we test our code in the first place. Especially unit tests help us think about our code in a more …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes is an open-source project that “containerizes” workloads and services and manages deployment and configurations. Released by Google in 2015, Kubernetes is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. Since its release, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/">cloud native companies use</a> it, SaaS vendors offer commercial prebuilt versions, and there’s even an annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">convention</a>!<br></p><p>What has made Kubernetes become such a fundamental service? A major factor is its automation capabilities. Kubernetes can automatically make changes to the configuration of deployed containers or even deploy new containers based on metrics it tracks or requests made by engineers. Having Kubernetes handle these processes saves time, eliminates toil, and increases consistency.<br></p><p>If these benefits sound familiar, it might be because they overlap with the philosophies of SRE. But how do you incorporate the automation of Kubernetes into your SRE practices? In this blog post, we’ll explain the Kubernetes Operator—the Kubernetes function at the heart of customized automation—and discuss how it can evolve your SRE solution.</p><h3>What the Kubernetes Operator can do</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Operators-Automating-Container-Orchestration/dp/1492048046"><em>Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform</em></a>, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood describe an Operator as “an automated Site Reliability Engineer for its application.” Given an SRE’s multifaceted experience and diverse workload, this is a bold statement. So what exactly can the Operator do?</p><h4>Kubernetes Operators complete sophisticated tasks</h4><p>The Operator can complete complex tasks in order to achieve the desired changes in the application’s output. It can automatically handle such tasks as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deploying applications</li><li>Updating applications to new versions</li><li>Reconfiguring application settings</li><li>Scaling applications up and down depending on usage</li><li>Failure handling</li><li>Setting up monitoring infrastructure<br></li></ul><p>Without Kubernetes Operators, engineers would need to complete these tasks. Automating them saves time and toil, and makes the procedures and results consistent.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators control custom resources and applications</h4><p>Kubernetes allows you to create and define custom resources based on specific applications. The custom resource is a data object generated by your application containing metrics on the application's state. Imagine you have an application that produces new server instances based on usage. You could define your custom resource to check RAM and disk space for each new instance. You can also define a custom resource as a target that the application is trying to match. The Kubernetes Operator can then control the application to achieve the target custom resource; if the application is spinning up servers that have insufficient RAM or disk space, the Operator can reconfigure the settings to match the desired amount.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators make stateful decisions</h4><p>The Kubernetes Operator is able to modify the configuration and usage of an application based on the application’s output. This is determined by the custom resources defined for that application. Custom resources showing the desired state and custom resources showing the current state form a loop. The Operator observes the current state and then takes actions that will make the application produce the desired state. After the actions are executed, the current state is reevaluated and the loop begins again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, a custom resource could define the desirable state of a new server instance as some amount of load capability based on its physical resources.The Operator would then adjust the configuration until new instances reached these standards.</p><h3>Kubernetes Operators and SRE</h3><p>If you’re using Kubernetes, you’ll find that building and implementing Operators aligns with your SRE goals.</p><h4>Operator monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs</h4><p>When developing the custom resource for your application, you need to choose which signals from the application’s output will be monitored by the resource and which targets the Operator will steer the application toward. This is similar to creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a> and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process of determining metrics with greatest impact is similar for Operators and SLIs. In the <em>Kubernetes Operators</em> textbook, Dobies and Wood suggest looking first at the “four golden signals” (<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">a concept from Google’s SRE book</a>) to determine what the Operator should monitor. These are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Latency</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Errors</li><li>Saturation<br></li></ul><p>Creating Operators for your applications will help you understand what SLIs and SLOs should be set for them. Likewise, setting SLIs and SLOs can help you understand what your Operators should monitor.<br></p><p>You might notice that when servers are overloaded, your customers are unhappy with the application’s availability.<br></p><p>You can set a custom resource to monitor the disk space available. At 5% remaining capacity, your custom resource will spin up new server instances, giving your customers better service. Your SLI will be based on availability and will monitor disk space. Your SLO might dictate that you need to achieve 99.9% availability to keep your customers happy, informing the Operator’s intervention points.</p><h4>Automating SRE application deployment</h4><p>Your SRE practice will involve applications being deployed on a regular basis for each new instance of a service. For example, you may want to deploy a monitoring application every time you implement a new area of system architecture. Kubernetes Operators can expedite and automate this process. For monitoring, the <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/the-prometheus-operator.html">Prometheus Operator</a> is one of the first Operators developed by Kubernetes. It automatically deploys and controls a new instance of the open-source monitoring software <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> onto any targeted clusters.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/choosing-sre-tools">SRE tools</a> represent an investment in reliability. The time spent implementing them is paid for by the time they save. Creating Operators is a similar investment. By creating Operators, you save time on each deployment. Furthermore, deployments are consistent and reliable. Your SRE practices have less overhead and can scale with your organization.</p><h4>Operators and incident management</h4><p>Operators can be set up to make adjustments to handle failure. If the application’s custom resource varies from the desired result, the Operator will make changes to compensate until the desired state is achieved. The cause of the variation is irrelevant to the Operator. It only operates based on the current and desired states. You will still need to work through an incident retrospective to bubble up contributing factors.<br></p><p>When developing your incident response plan, the behavior of your Operators can be a valuable resource. If you know that the Operator will automatically try to correct the behavior, you can incorporate that into your expectations and procedures. For example, if you have an incident response plan for oversaturated servers, your Operator could spin up new server instances or reconfigure load balancing. Your response plan would take this into account, saving you some troubleshooting steps and allowing you to focus on the originating issue. By combining Operators and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">automated runbooks</a>, you can minimize the amount of manual escalation and resolve many incidents without human intervention. As automation is another core goal of SRE, this is another way that Kubernetes Operators fit into your reliability strategy.<br></p><p>As you shift your services to a container-based model and Kubernetes becomes more fundamental to your DevOps practices, it’s important to incorporate Operators into your reliability strategy. Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and responses, allowing for more automation and less toil.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, check out these resources:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">Webinar: Modern Metrics to Understand Operational Health</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SRE</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">How to Classify Incidents</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p>A couple of threads got me thinking about the limits of <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2020/08/07/thoughts-on-stamp/">STAMP</a>.</p>



<p>The first thread was sparked by a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24114720">link to a Hacker News comment</a>, sent to me be a colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyThomas">Danny Thomas</a>. This introduced me to a concept I hadn’t of heard of before, a <em>battleshort</em>. There’s even an official definition in a NATO document:</p>



<blockquote><p>The capability to bypass certain safety features in a system to ensure completion of the mission without interruption due to the safety feature</p><cite><a href="http://www.nato.int/structur/ac/310/pdf/aop-38-3.pdf">AOP-38</a>, Allied Ordnance Publication 38, Edition 3,&nbsp;<em>Glossary of terms and definitions concerning the safety and suitability for service of munitions, explosives and related products</em>, April 2002.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The second thread was sparked by a Twitter exchange between a UK Southern Railway train driver and the official UK Southern Railway twitter account:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People find a way to use the systems they have access to in order to get their work done, in ways never anticipated by the system designers. <a href="https://t.co/D7ll99aeB2">https://t.co/D7ll99aeB2</a></p>— Lorin Hochstein E_TOO_MANY_FAILURE_MODES (@lhochstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/lhochstein/status/1293577818605936642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>This is a great example of <em>exapting</em>, a concept introduced by the paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth Vrba. Exaptation is a solution to the following problem in evolutionary biology: what good is a partially functional wing? Either an animal can fly or it can’t, and a fully functional wing can’t evolve in a single generation, so how do the initial evolutionary stages of a wing confer advantage on the organism?</p>



<p>The answer is that: while a partially functional wing might be useless for flight, it might still be useful as a fin. And so, if wings evolved from fins, then the appendage may always confer an advantage at each evolutionary stage. The fin is <em>exapted</em> into a wing; it is repurposed to serve a new function. In the Twitter example above, the railway driver repurposed a social media service for communicating with his own organization. </p>



<p>Which brings us back to STAMP. One of the central assumptions of STAMP is that it is possible to construct an accurate enough control model of the system at the design stage to identify all of the hazards and unsafe control actions. You can see this assumption in action in the <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/get_file4.php?name=CAST_handbook.pdf">CAST handbook  </a>(CAST is STAMP’s accident analysis process) in the example questions from page 40 of the handbook  (emphasis mine), which uses counterfactual reasoning to try identify flaws in the original hazard analysis.</p>



<p><em>Did the design account for the possibility of this increased pressure? <strong>If not, why not?</strong> Was this risk assessed at the design stage?</em></p>



<p><em><strong>This seems like a predictable design flaw</strong>. Was the unsafe interaction between the two requirements (preventing liquid from entering the flare and the need to discharge gases to the flare) identified in the design or hazard analysis efforts? If so, why was it not handled in the design or in operational procedures? <strong>If it was not identified, why not?</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Why wasn’t the increasing pressure detected and handled?</strong></em> <em>If there were alerts, why did they not result in effective action to handle the increasing pressure? If there were automatic overpressurization control devices (e.g., relief valves), why were they not effective? <strong>If there were not automatic devices, then why not?</strong> Was it not feasible to provide them?</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Was this type of pressure increase anticipated?</strong> If it was anticipated, then why was it not handled in the design or operational procedures? <strong>If it was not anticipated, why not?</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Was there any way to contain the contents within some controlled area (barrier), at least the catalyst pellets?</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Why was the area around the reactor not isolated during a potentially hazardous operation? Why was there no protection against catalyst pellets flying around?</strong></em></p>



<p>This line of reasoning assumes that all hazards are, in principle, identifiable at the design stage. I think that phenomena like <em>battleshorts </em>and <em>exaptations</em> make this goal unattainable.</p>



<p>Now, in principle, nothing prevents an engineer using STPA (STAMP’s hazard analysis technique) from identifying scenarios that involve <em>battleshorts</em> and <em>exaptations</em>. After all, STPA is an <em>exploratory</em> technique. But I suspect that many of these kinds of adaptations are literally <em><strong>unimaginable</strong></em> to the designers.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h2>
<p>It’s a fresh new day at work, and you want to find the dot product of two arrays (that is, the sum of the product of the pairs of elements). You’re using your favourite language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>. You’re allergic to <code>Seq.zip</code> (maybe you’re terrified of virtual calls or something), and <code>Array.zip</code> just allocates too much memory. Also, you want to make sure you can bail out of the iteration early; what if someone tells you at the last minute that you have to stop if you see the number <code>100</code>?</p>
<p>Cracking your knuckles, the following pours from your fingertips:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, of course! And then you write the unit tests and discover how truly exquisite the infinite loop is that you have made.</p>
<p>With a gentle sigh of one who has arisen bright and refreshed only to discover the computer in a sullen and recalcitrant mood, you insert the line that makes everything work.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> ans <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span>shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span> <span>do</span>
        ans <span>&lt;-</span> ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>])</span>
        <span>// How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</span>
        <span>// seem to me all the uses of this world</span>
        i <span>&lt;-</span> i <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    ans
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now the tests pass, and you can stride forward into a glorious day of productivity.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it have been lovely if this mistake hadn’t happened?</p>
<h2 id="going-loopy">Going loopy</h2>
<p>The mistake was that we introduced a piece of state, but never changed it. A sufficiently advanced compiler can warn us about a variable that is set but never used – but the problem still remains in general. (What if we had printed the iteration variable, and therefore used it? Or what if we had a slightly more complicated computation for which we legitimately performed some mutation to the state in our loop body, but still forgot to do the final increment?)</p>
<p>With a small change to the shape of this function, we can make the bug so obvious that we would never dream of making it.</p>
<div>
<pre><span>type</span> <span>Index</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>

<span>let</span> truncatedDotProduct
    <span>(</span>shouldContinue <span>:</span> <span>Index</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>xs <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>ys <span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>array</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>(</span>ans <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>i <span>:</span> <span>Index</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>if</span> shouldContinue i xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>then</span>
            go <span>(</span>ans <span>+</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> ys<span>.[</span>i<span>]))</span> <span>(</span>i <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
            ans

    go <span>0</span> <span>0</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we are forced to declare explicitly that the index in the next iteration will be <code>i + 1</code>. Merely omitting this decision is not an option any more, because the compiler will force us to give a second argument to <code>go</code> whenever we invoke it.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the termination condition of the loop has been tidied up; I would argue that it’s now easier to see that if <code>shouldContinue</code> fails, we return the value we’d got up to <em>before</em> the current index. (Admittedly, that one is more of a matter of taste; maybe you personally find it easier to understand the termination condition of the explicit <code>while</code> loop.)</p>
<p>And in a language like F#, we don’t lose any performance using this approach. A language with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail-call optimisation</a> will optimise away the recursive call into an imperative loop behind the scenes; in fact, the recursive and the imperative code may well boil down to exactly the same machine code. (By contrast, some languages like Python lack tail-call optimisation, so in Python this approach is liable to end in a stack overflow.)</p>
<h2 id="backing-off">Backing off</h2>
<p>For another prime example, consider a famous saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What is less often noted is that one should wait some period of time in between each retry.</p>
<p>Of course, there are libraries which do this for you (<a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a>, for example). But for the sake of argument, let’s say we want to write a simple exponential backoff ourselves. (We’ll mock out the <code>sleep</code> function, to allow us to test the logic more easily; it’ll probably be given as <code>System.Threading.Thread.Sleep</code> at the call site, but nobody wants to be calling <code>Thread.Sleep</code> in a unit test.)</p>

<p>Easy enough, but let’s give it the recursive treatment:</p>

<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> doThingRetryingWithBackoff<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>err<span>&gt;</span>

                go newRetries

    go <span>0</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>No need for the sad <code>isDone</code> sentinel here! Since looping was an active choice (an explicit call to <code>go</code>), we were free simply to choose not to loop at any point, and specifically at the point where <code>doThing</code> had returned successfully.</p>

        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Or, in the shiny new world which is free of <code>while</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>let</span> pollInfinitely<span>&lt;</span><span>'</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span>sleep <span>:</span> <span>TimeSpan</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>

    <span>(</span>doThings <span>:</span> <span>'</span>a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span> <span>unit</span>
    <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> go <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> values <span>=</span> poll <span>()</span>
        doThings values
        sleep <span>(</span><span>TimeSpan</span>.<span>FromSeconds</span> <span>5</span><span>.)</span>
        go <span>()</span>

    go <span>()</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This example looks too simple to be of any use, and maybe indeed it is; and of course in real life there is <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> which solves this problem better. (This is only a toy example.)</p>
<p>But I would argue that once you’re familiar with the general pattern, this is a natural way to express the loop. Moreover, it is extremely extensible: if we decide we don’t actually want to loop forever, it’s trivial to add extra state by inserting it as parameters to <code>go</code>, and the compiler will try its best to help us use it correctly. (By contrast, with the <code>while</code> loop and mutable state, we are on our own: the compiler can’t know what we had in mind for the state.<br>
It will freely let us either modify the state when we didn’t want to, or fail to modify it when we did want to.)</p>
<h2 id="winding-up">Winding up</h2>
<p>Though it may look very odd at first sight, it soon becomes quite natural to think about loops in this recursive way. It allows you to express more of the problem in the type system, helping the compiler to point out when you’ve done things like “adding a new piece of state but forgetting to use it everywhere you wanted it”. It also makes the act of looping into a conscious choice at each stage; if you’ve ever longed for the good old days of <code>goto</code> to break out of loops, this actually gives you back something of that flavour, but much more safe!</p>
<p>Making the loop state immutable makes it easier to reason about the invariants and behaviour of the loop, and helps you write safer programs fast.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>Auckland, New Zealand, August 31, 2020</strong> – Open source software company, <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer.io</a>, has launched version 2.0 of its platform which includes support for the Kubernetes container orchestrator, for the first time.</p>
<p>In three years, Portainer.io has over half a million regular Docker Swarm users with its 1.X version. It is anticipated the addition of support for Kubernetes will further accelerate growth for the start up.</p>
<p>Portainer makes operating container platforms easy. It provides a simple, click-to-configure interface which removes all of the unnecessary complexity and negates the need for users to learn complex syntax. Portainer users can now deploy and manage notoriously complicated applications on a Kubernetes platform, quickly and easily. Users no longer need to know how to write YAML or understand the Kubernetes CLI or API. In addition to Kube, Portainer continues to operate across all major orchestration systems including Docker Swarm and Azure ACI.</p>
<p>According to Portainer.io CEO and Co-Founder, Neil Cresswell, Portainer CE 2.0 is a hugely important release for Portainer; “It takes the company back to its true open source roots as Portainer CE 2.0 no longer includes ‘Extensions’, Portainer’s previously paid-for features,” he explains.</p>
<p>“While the addition of Kubernetes embraces our ability to support the full breadth of the container management community. Portainer CE 2.0 also lays the foundational platform for Portainer Business, Portainer’s soon to be released premium service for business customers.”</p>
<p>Last month Portainer attracted an initial<a href="https://www.portainer.io/2020/08/portainer-io-closes-us1-2-million-seed-financing/"> seed funding round</a> of US$1.2 million to fast-track its growth plans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Compared to a few years ago, there’s no doubt that open source vendors can be financially successful. Red Hat paved the way. In the last quarter before the IBM acquisition, Red Hat achieved a $3.7B annualized revenue run rate<sup>[1]</sup>. <strong>That’s incredible.</strong> Despite Red Hat’s success, the overwhelming majority of today’s open source vendors are not following Red Hat’s footsteps. For good reasons, most companies follow an open core model (selling proprietary software that extends the functionality of the “open core” aka the open source project). It provides more flexibility and allows for better monetization in most cases.</p><p>When I reflect on the many conversations I had with technical startup founders over the last year, I see another sea change happening: <strong>It’s less about the open source movements' ideals and philosophical beliefs.</strong> What matters to this new “class” of founders is whether using open source makes their company more successful or not. Some of them push it to an extreme and see it as their primary differentiator. “<em>We are like x, but open source</em>”. I don’t believe this theme will last for long but might provide an edge in certain markets for a short period of time. The approach can be powerful if paired with another unique differentiator (e.g., Mattermost = Slack but self-managed/on-premise + open source).</p><p>Some people believe that open source software will take over the world. I disagree. <strong>Open source doesn’t necessarily result in better products.</strong> More importantly, most non-developers<sup>[2]</sup> don’t care about open source. It’s irrelevant to their purchase decisions. It’s not driving consumer behavior. The reason is straightforward. If you don’t have the desire or skills to download and run an open source project, there’s no advantage over a comparable product that’s free. There is one caveat to this. Developers can bring non-developer products into a company if they play an important role in adopting these products (e.g., Stripe as a payment provider).</p><p>If you consider building a B2B company that serves a technical audience, open source might be a powerful tool for you. Most likely, you will pick open core<sup>[3]</sup> as a monetization strategy. <strong>Open core has a “built-in conflict” between the open source project, the community, and the commercial vendor.</strong> By definition, if you extend the “open core” with proprietary functionality (so that you can monetize), you hold functionality from the open source project. Managing this conflict is crucial for the success of your company. It will help tremendously if you derive what goes into open source vs. what’s proprietary from first principles.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut.jpg 2206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There’s one important question you should ask yourself for every new capability:</p><p><strong>Who is the primary user of this feature?</strong></p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>developer</strong>, it should always go into 	open source. The better your open source project is, the more adoption you will see. In case there are multiple, competitive projects in a given problem space, it will also help you differentiate and win<sup>[4]</sup>. All of that results in a larger addressable market for you. As an open source vendor, you are constrained by the adoption of your open source project. Assuming you hold back those developer features, and try to monetize them, you will not generate a lot of revenue. The money is somewhere else (manager, executive). If you want to monetize the developer adoption, offer a SaaS product.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is the <strong>manager</strong>, you can most likely keep the capability proprietary. The most important exception to this rule is if engineering managers are the primary users of the product (e.g., a tool that helps the manager manage). Another way to think about this is the following: Within an organizational hierarchy, you monetize the top (exec/manager) and contribute the bottom capabilities (practitioner/manager) to open source.</p><p>If the user/beneficiary of a feature is an <strong>executive</strong>, you keep the capability proprietary.</p><p><strong>There are two reasons for this framework.</strong></p><p>The obvious one is the monetization potential of a given capability. Executives can spend more money ($$$), than managers ($$), who can spend more than practitioners ($). You lose very little by not monetizing the persona with the least monetization potential. In return, you are more likely to get a lot of bottom-up adoption, making selling to executives/managers easier. Additionally, offering a SaaS product allows you to monetize the practitioner segment at least partially.</p><p>The second reason is less obvious but equally critical. Executives won’t contribute to your open source project. Managers will do it rarely. If they need a specific capability, they won’t open a PR towards your open source project. In some cases, they might ask an engineer in their organization to build it for them, but that’s the exception, and rarely the case if you offer the capability for a reasonable price. Developers are the opposite. If they miss a capability, they will be inclined to contribute. This is fantastic and exactly what you want because it increases the value of your open source project. Most important, rejecting a PR from a developer for a developer feature (because you want to monetize it) will inadvertently create conflict. Other developers will be less inclined to contribute, causing your open source project to suffer. You won’t have a thriving and growing community.</p><p><strong>Open Core is a terrific business model if you manage the inherent conflict about what to open-source and what to keep proprietary well.</strong></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open Core - Monetize Through First Principles<a href="https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD">https://t.co/mWOab4nYbD</a></p>— Moritz Plassnig (@moritzplassnig) <a href="https://twitter.com/moritzplassnig/status/1299876092745052161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Editor Blending Markdown, Blocks and Wysiwyg]]>
            </title>

August 31, 2020 | https://papyrs.com/block-wiki-markdown-editor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://papyrs.com/block-wiki-markdown-editor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<p>
Many Markdown editors render a preview of the result but don't allow visual editing, which makes it difficult to edit
visual elements like tables. Block-based editors on the other hand, great
for creating pages with many different types of content, don't support editing with Markdown (or if they do, limited
to adding some markup within a single block, instead of actually editing the doc).
</p>
<p>For our <a href="https://papyrs.com/">wiki/knowledge base app</a>, we've been working on a new editor. Our aim was to have one simple editor
which would work for sharing pretty much anything, from visual pages
with interactive elements to mostly-textual documentation &amp; tech specs. The idea was it should be just as pleasant
to use for an engineer writing a technical document, HR building a form or internal comms posting news.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, some observations for the editor we wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiar to non-technical people (WYSIWYG, drag&amp;drop).
</li><li>Markdown as an option is great for portability/importing, copy-pasting, writing (large) text docs.
</li><li>Widgets to add and edit rich elements (polls, embeds, forms, tasks, and so on).
</li><li>When working in a team, some people will prefer WYSIWYG, some a markup language. People need to be able to switch between the two.
</li></ul>
<p>Some examples of what combining all these elements look like:</p>
<h3>Easy table editing</h3>
<p>The editor supports some Markdown extensions such as tables and checklists from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>.
These are also available as widgets in our visual editor, and by just switching between Markdown and visual editing,
we can easily do things like manipulate tables, add rows, delete columns, and so on.</p>

<source src="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/editor/markdown-editor-table.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3>Quick task list editing</h3>
<p>Plain text is great for importing, copy-pasting and so on. In this example we have a list of tasks as a text document, which
we can simply copy-paste. Switching to visual mode brings the plain text to live as it were, making it easy to perform actions
on like reordering tasks, completing subtasks or dragging a set of tasks between different task lists.</p>

<source src="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/editor/editor-checklist-markdown-blocks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3>Re-ordering with drag&amp;drop</h3>
<p>When switching from Markdown to visual editing, the editor will automatically convert a Markdown document back into widgets (blocks) and vice versa.
This way we can switch between the two whenever an action is more convenient in either visual mode or Markdown, such as dragging around some
content.</p>

<source src="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/editor/editor-blocks-markdown-drag.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>
The example below shows a bit of everything: using drag&amp;drop, keyboard shortcuts (command palette), adding
interactive widgets (poll/calendar), editing the layout.. and still having the option to use Markdown. 🦄</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" poster="https://papyrs.com/site_media/images/v3/main-movie-poster.jpg">

</video>
<h3>Some more examples</h3>
<p>
If you want to see some more screenshots, check out the <a href="https://papyrs.com/#use-case-examples">example gallery</a>.
We've also built <a href="https://papyrs.com/docsv2/" target="_blank">our own product docs</a> (such as Papyrs' API documentation) in the editor.

<p>If you think this is useful or want to give it a spin, sign up to <a href="https://papyrs.com/try/">create a Papyrs site</a>.
It contains a bunch of example pages so you can dive in and give the editor a go. It's a free trial but we have a free plan for personal use.</p>

<p>This is a mirror of the elective course <a href="https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=fagbesk&amp;id=37292&amp;listid=2858&amp;lang=en">'SM2-TES: Functional Programming and Property-Based Testing'</a> offered in the spring 2019 on the MSc education in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Mmmi_maersk_mckinney_moeller.aspx">Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/">University of Southern Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the course were given in the <a href="https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=40112">spring of 2018 and 2019 at SDU</a> and in January 2016 and 2017 as <a href="http://www.kurser.dtu.dk/02913.aspx?menulanguage=en-GB">02913: Advanced Analysis Techniques</a> at <a href="http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english">DTU Compute</a>, <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/english">the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.</p>
<p>This course material is posted here for the purpose of information sharing. I don't believe in password-protected course administration systems. As a scholar I (continue to) benefit from freely available online material. This is a personal contribution to uphold such an eco-system.</p>
<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>
<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>
<p>The course consists of a mix of lectures and practical exercises, held in weekly 4-hour sessions.</p>
<p>Lectures: Mondays 12:15-16:00 in <a href="https://clients.mapsindoors.com/sdu/573f26e4bc1f571b08094312/details/563cb924423b7d0540c9a4a6">room U82</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last year or so, Yale’s DHLab has undertaken a series of experiments organized around analysis of visual culture. Some of those experiments have involved <a href="https://douglasduhaime.com/posts/identifying-similar-images-with-tensorflow.html">identifying similar images</a> and visualizing patterns uncovered in this process. In this post, I wanted to discuss how we used the amazing Three.js library to build a WebGL-powered <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lab-apps/pix-plot/index.html">visualization</a> that can display tens of thousands of images in an interactive 3D environment [click to enter]:</p>

</a></p>

<p>If you’re interested in creating something similar, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot">full code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-threejs">Getting Started with Three.js</h2>

<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library that generates lower-level code for WebGL, the standard API for 3D rendering in a web browser. Using Three.js, one can build complex 3D environments that would take much more code to build in raw WebGL. For a quick sample of the projects others have built with the library, check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js homepage</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with Three.js, one needs to provide a bit of boilerplate code with the three essential elements of a Three.js page:</p>

<p><strong>scene</strong>: The scene contains all objects to be rendered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the scene and a camera to view it</span>
<span>var</span> <span>scene</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Scene</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>camera</strong>: The camera determines the position from which viewers see the scene:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Specify the portion of the scene visiable at any time (in degrees)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>fieldOfView</span> <span>=</span> <span>75</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the camera's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>aspectRatio</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span> <span>/</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the near and far clipping planes. Only objects</span>
<span>// between those planes will be rendered in the scene</span>
<span>// (these values help control the number of items rendered</span>
<span>// at any given time)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>nearPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>farPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use the values specified above to create a camera</span>
<span>var</span> <span>camera</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PerspectiveCamera</span><span>(</span>
  <span>fieldOfView</span><span>,</span> <span>aspectRatio</span><span>,</span> <span>nearPlane</span><span>,</span> <span>farPlane</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Finally, set the camera's position in the z-dimension</span>
<span>camera</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>renderer</strong>: The renderer renders the scene to a canvas element on an HTML page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the canvas with a renderer and tell the</span>
<span>// renderer to clean up jagged aliased lines</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>WebGLRenderer</span><span>({</span><span>antialias</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>

<span>// Specify the size of the canvas</span>
<span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>setSize</span><span>(</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the canvas to the DOM</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span> <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>domElement</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The code above creates the scene, adds a camera, and renders the canvas to the DOM. Now all we need to do is add some objects to the scene.</p>

<p>Each item rendered in a Three.js scene has a <strong>geometry</strong> and a <strong>material</strong>. Geometries use vertices (points) and faces (polygons described by vertices) to define the shape of an object, and materials use textures and colors to define the appearance of that shape. A geometry and a material can be combined into a <strong>mesh</strong>, which is a fully composed object ready to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>The example below uses the high-level <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/BoxGeometry">BoxGeometry</a>, which comes with pre-built vertices and faces:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a cube with width, height, and depth set to 1</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>BoxGeometry</span><span>(</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Use a simple material with a specified hex color</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshBasicMaterial</span><span>({</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Combine the geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>cube</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span> <span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the mesh to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span> <span>cube</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, to render the scene on the page, one must call the <code>render()</code> method, passing in the scene and the camera as arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Combining the snippets above gives the following result:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXdYpx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The Simplest Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/WXdYpx/">The Simplest Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is great, but the scene is static. To add some <strong>animation</strong> to the scene, one can periodically update the cube’s rotation property, then rerender the scene. To do so, one can replace the <code>renderer.render()</code> line above with a render loop that calls itself recursively. Here is a standard render loop in Three.js:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>

  <span>// Rotate the object a bit each animation frame</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding this block at the bottom of the script makes the cube slowly rotate:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWpvNL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animating the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/vWpvNL/">Animating the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>lights</strong> to the scene can make it easier to differentiate the faces of the cube. To add lights to the scene above, we’ll first want to change the cube’s material, because as the documentation says the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial">MeshBasicMaterial</a> is not affected by lights. Let’s replace the material defined above with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial">MeshPhongMaterial</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshPhongMaterial</span><span>({</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span><span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next let’s point a light at the cube so that different faces of the cube catch different amounts of light:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Add a point light with #fff color, .7 intensity, and 0 distance</span>
<span>var</span> <span>light</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PointLight</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffff</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Specify the light's position in the x, y, and z dimensions</span>
<span>light</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Add the light to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>light</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mqparr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Lighting the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/mqparr/">Lighting the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-to-a-scene">Adding Images to a Scene</h2>

<p>The snippets above give a quick overview of the core elements of a Three.js scene. The following section will build upon those ideas to create a TSNE map of images.</p>

<p>To build an image viewer, we’ll need to load some image files into some Three.js materials. We can do so by using the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader">TextureLoader</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a texture loader so we can load the image file</span>
<span>var</span> <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>TextureLoader</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Specify the path to an image</span>
<span>var</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/tsne-webgl/assets/cat.jpg'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Load an image file into a MeshLambert material</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshLambertMaterial</span><span>({</span>
  <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the material is ready, the remaining steps are to generate a geometry from the image, combine the material and geoemtry into a mesh, and add the mesh to the scene, just like the cube example above. Because images are two-dimensional planes, we can use a simple <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a> for this object’s geometry:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a plane geometry for the image with a width of 10</span>
<span>// and a height that preserves the image's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PlaneGeometry</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>75</span><span>);</span>

<span>// combine the image geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span><span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span><span>);</span>

<span>// set the position of the image mesh in the x,y,z dimensions</span>
<span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>// add the image to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The image will now appear in the scene:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jaYdLg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/jaYdLg/">Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that one can swap out the PlanarGeometry for other geometries and Three.js will automatically wrap the material over the new geometry. The example below, for instance, swaps the PlanarGeometry for a more interesting Icosahedron geometry, and rotates the icosahedron inside the render loop:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// use an icosahedron geometry instead of the planar geometry</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>IcosahedronGeometry</span><span>();</span>

<span>// spin the icosahedron each animation frame</span>
<span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This produces a strange looking cat indeed:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="NwXeoB" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Icosahedron Cat">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/NwXeoB/">Icosahedron Cat</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-custom-geometries">Building Custom Geometries</h2>

<p>The examples above use a few different geometries built into Three.js. Those geometries are based on the fundamental <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry">THREE.Geometry</a> class, which is a primitive geometry one can use to create custom geometries. THREE.Geometry is lower-level than the prebuilt geometries used above, but it gives performance gains that make it worth the effort.</p>

<p>Let’s create a custom geometry by calling the THREE.Geometry constructor, which takes no arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Geometry</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This geometry object doesn’t do much yet, because it doesn’t have any vertices with which to ariculate a shape. Let’s add four vertices to the geometry, one for each corner of the image. Each vertex takes three arguments, which define the vertex’s x, y, and z positions respectively:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// identify the image width and height</span>
<span>var</span> <span>imageSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>7.5</span><span>};</span>

<span>// identify the x, y, z coords where the image should be placed</span>
<span>// inside the scene</span>
<span>var</span> <span>coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>3.75</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>};</span>

<span>// add one vertex for each image corner in this order:</span>
<span>// lower left, lower right, upper right, upper left</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>

<p>Now that the vertices are in place, we need to add some faces to the geometry. The code below will model an image as two triangle faces, as triangles are performant primitives in the WebGL world. The first triangle will combine the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right vertices of the image, and the second will triangulate the lower-left, upper-right, and upper-left vertices of the image:</p>

<p>Awesome, we now have a geometry with four vertices that describe the corners of the image, and two faces that describe the lower-right and upper-left-hand triangles of the image. The next step is to describe which portions of the cat image should appear in each of the faces of the geometry. To do so, one …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Grover’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to search from <strong>unstructured</strong> database using less than $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Comparing to $O(N)$ which is the best asymptotical complexity that a classical search algorithm could achieve for unstructured database, Grover’s algorithm is significantly better.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Grover’s algorithm and its caveats in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Simon-Algorithm/">property of Hadamard operator</a>, we have already known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We denote it using $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ for our convenience.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following equation would be useful for this article.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I &amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) - I \\
&amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big)^{\dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle | \mathbf{0} \rangle^{\dagger}  H^{\otimes {n} \dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - H^{\otimes {n}} I H^{\otimes {n}} \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} \big(2 | \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} | - I \big) H^{\otimes {n}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is the outer product of $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and the $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is the outer product. Note that outer product $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is a little bit different from Kronecker product which we have used $\otimes$ to denote in the previous articles.</p>



<p>Let’s check what $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | &amp;= \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes_{\text{outer}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \langle \mathbf{y} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $J$ is the unit matrix.</p>



<p>We further define matrix $A$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would like to further show that matrix $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>It is trivial to see that $A^{\dagger} = A$, therefore, $(2A - I)^{\dagger} = 2A - I$. Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(2A - I)^{\dagger} (2A - I) &amp;= (2A - I) (2A - I)^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= (2A - I)^2 \\
&amp;= 4A^2 - 4A + I \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{2^{2n}} 2^n J_{2^n \times 2^n} - \frac{4}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} + I \\
&amp;= 0 + I \\
&amp;= I \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>In addition, $2A - I$ is actually an reflection matrix that could reflect the vector $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \rangle&amp;= (2A - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= (2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle ( \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle ) - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle | \mathbf{s} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Typically, given a normalized unit vector $\mathbf{n}$, and a vector $\mathbf{x}$, the reflected vector of vector $\mathbf{x}$ about $\mathbf{n}$ is</p><p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = 2 \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{x}\]

</p><p>This is high-school math. If the reader forgot how to understand this, please refer to the blog post <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/reflected/">“Calculating the Reflected Ray”</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is a reflection matrix about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="identity-search-problem">Identity Search Problem</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an array of items $\{v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}\}$, and we would like to find a target item $v_g$ to find from the array. Using a classical algorithm, we have to go through the entire array, that is we retrieve items one by one from the array and compare them against the target item. The asymptotic complexity for the worst case and the average case are both $O(n)$.</p>



<p>It seems that $O(n)$ is the best we could do for a search problem using a classical algorithm. How could we know where is target item is in the array without going through the entire array? However, using a quantum algorithm, we would be able to complete a search in $O(\sqrt{n})$. In the next sections, we would see how we could achieve this.</p>



<p>Suppose all the items are distinct and there is only one item matching the query, the search problem could be modeled using a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, and we are assured that there exits exactly one binary string $\mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The search problem is converted to find $\mathbf{x}^\ast$.</p>

<h3 id="grovers-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="quantum-oracle-circuit">Quantum Oracle Circuit</h4>

<p>The following quantum oracle circuit is used for phase inversion in the Grover’s algorithm.</p>

    <figcaption>Quantum Oracle Circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This quantum oracle circuit has been well discussed in my previous article on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. We have known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{f(\mathbf{x})} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If the top input qubits to $U_f$ is an equal superposition, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>what will the top output qubits be?</p>



<p>Because we have assumed that there is only one $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$, and for $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$ we have $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} (-1)^{0} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{1} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \Bigg) \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that for the top output qubits, although we have equal probability to observe each of the base qubit states, the phase amplitude of the base qubit $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$ is different from all the others! That is also to say, the phase of the top input qubits is 
$\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$, but the phase of the output qubits becomes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$.</p>

<h4 id="phase-diffusion-circuit">Phase Diffusion Circuit</h4>

<p>Now, in order to find $| \mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, the strategy becomes straightforward. We just have to find out the base qubits state whose phase amplitude is different from others. The question is, how to find it?</p>



<p>Let’s do some dummy trials. If we send the top output qubits to another identical quantum oracle circuit, the phase will go back to $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$. The readers could verify this on you own. This means we have gone back to the origin. We should probably do something differently.</p>



<p>What Grover found was actually very smart. The average of the phase amplitudes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$ is a value only a little bit smaller than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, because the majority of the phase amplitudes are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, and only one phase amplitude corresponding to $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, which we denote as $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$, is $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$. If we could <em>inverse the phase amplitude about the mean</em>, the absolute value of $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$ will become the largest among all the phase amplitudes.</p>



<p>Specifically, at time step $t$, suppose the phase amplitude for each base qubits state $|\mathbf{x} \rangle$ is $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}$. The average of the phase amplitudes $\mu_t$ is</p><p>

\[\mu_t = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n}^{} \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}\]

</p><p>After the <em>inversion about the mean</em>, the phase amplitudes would become</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}^{\prime} &amp;= (\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}) + \mu_t \\
&amp;= 2\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t} \\
\end{align}\]

            <p>As I have mentioned in other posts on this blog (and surely many would agree here), I strongly believe that a great start for designing a program is figuring out good representations for the real world problem one tries to solve, <em>i.e.</em> defining appropriate types.
One helpful technique for that is what one could call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/ijln21/blog_sum_types_in_julia_and_rust/g3f1gtn/"><em>optionality</em></a> .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Interestingly, it is expressed completely differently in different programming languages which I would like to briefly demonstrate in this article using Rust and Julia as examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Julia and Rust are my favourite programming languages and they are particularly suited to demonstrate my point.
That should not stop you from reading if you use neither of these languages, though!
First, both have a rather intuitive syntax and the code shown here is really basic, so you should be able to follow along.
Second, you can probably substitute your inheritance-using language for Julia (<em>e.g.</em> Java) or your tagged-union-using language for Rust (<em>e.g.</em> Haskell).
Even if not, you might learn something anyway!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Suppose, you are creating an intergalactic game where players can inhabit three different star systems: Our sun (the <em>solarians</em>), the polar star (the <em>polarians</em>) and Alpha Centauri (the <em>centaurians</em>).
An obvious first step would be to define types for each of these three classes:</p>
<p>In Julia:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>and in Rust (I will stick to this order if not stated otherwise):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Polarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Centaurian</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>(You would add some fields to those structs, of course, but that’s not the point here.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you need to store the player value in another object like a game state:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> GameState
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::???</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>???</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>What type would you use for <code>player</code> in each case?
And what about</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> homestar(player<span>::???</span>)<span>::</span>String
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(player: <span>???</span>) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>These are the questions we’re here for.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-inheritance--subtyping">Strategy 1: Inheritance / subtyping</h2>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>This is very straightforward in Julia.
Define</p>
<p>and make the structs from above subtypes of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Dynamic dispatch then allows you to write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">homestar(player<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> <span>"sun"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Polarian) <span>=</span> <span>"polar star"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Centaurian) <span>=</span> <span>"Alpha Centauri"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> <span>"unknown"</span> <span># or `error("Unknown player class")`</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>Rust does not have subtyping but you can define relations between types via <em>traits</em> (similar to interfaces in other languages).
So, we can try</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and then</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>But what about the <code>GameState</code> struct?
We can make use of <em>trait objects</em>, about which we only know that they implement a certain trait.
We especially don’t know the object’s size so we need to reference to it.
If you’re familiar with Rust, you know that this either means using a “normal” reference (<code>&amp;</code> or <code>&amp;mut</code>) and dealing with life time annotations (not my favourite, to be honest) or using a <code>Box</code>ed value.
If you’re not familiar with that, it doesn’t really matter here anyway.
<code>GameState</code> could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Player<span>&gt;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works, but does restrict us in what we can do with the <code>Player</code> trait, as it needs to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety"><em>object safe</em></a>.
For example, greeting another player of an arbitrary class</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span><span>&lt;</span>T: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>would not work anymore.</p>
<p>This would be easy in Julia, though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Hi!"</span>)
greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Your star doesn't even consist of three separate stars? Pathetic!"</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="strategy-1b-constrained-generics">Strategy 1b: Constrained generics</h2>
<p>Both Julia and Rust offer defining generic types with type parameters.
Additionally, one can put constraints on those parameters.
This allows us to do a smiliar thing as in strategy 1 but without hiding the concrete player type in the <code>GameState</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>abstract type</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>

<span>struct</span> GameState{P <span>&lt;:</span> Player}
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::</span>P
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player { ... }
<span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian { ... }

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span><span>&lt;</span>P: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>P</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This approach can be considered more performant in general, as the compiler can emit code for concrete types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics"><em>monomorphisation</em></a>) instead of carrying around a clumsy super type that keeps track of subtypes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, there is a major concern with this approach: <strong>abstraction leaking</strong>.
Users of the <code>GameState</code> struct now have to decide what concrete type to choose for the parameter <code>P</code>, very strictly so in Rust, not so much in Julia.
This can be okay, but often enough <code>GameState</code> is the right place to deal with that question and really should hide that detail.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb: Consider generics for this problem “deep down” in your code but don’t miss the abstraction level where it needs to be kept inside.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-enumerations">Strategy 2: Enumerations</h2>
<p>So far, the approaches were not really satisfying for Rust.
But enumerations come to the rescue!
Enumerations (or enums) are types that consist of a concrete and explicit list of possible values (so called <em>variants</em>).</p>
<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>
<p>In Rust, those values can even have their own data which is perfect for our situation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>PlayerClass</span> {
    Sol(Solarian),
    Pol(Polarian),
    Cent(Centaurian)
}

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>PlayerClass</span>
}

<span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> self {
            Sol(_) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>),
            ...
        }
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>PlayerClass</span>) {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> (self, other) {
            (Cent(_), Pol(_)) <span>=&gt;</span> println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, fellow three-star-systemer!"</span>),
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This indeed solves all our previous problems and is hence the go-to pattern for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="julia-1">Julia</h3>
<p>Julia does technically have enums, but not really.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">@enum PlayerClass Sol Pol Cent
</code></pre></div><p>exists and it will give you a type <code>PlayerClass</code> with exactly these three possible values but enums are not a first class citizen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
But that’s not even relevant for us, more importantly, enum variants in Julia are <em>not</em> able to carry additional data with them!
So all the information in the fields of the <code>Solarian</code>, <code>Polarian</code>, and <code>Centaurian</code> struct can not be build into the <code>PlayerClass</code> enum.
There is no way to sensibly implement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> takedamage!(player<span>::</span>PlayerClass)
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>whereas it is trivial in Rust:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>takedamage</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self) {
        <span>match</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self {
            PlayerClass::Sol(solarian) <span>=&gt;</span> solarian.health <span>-=</span> <span>42</span>,
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>assuming the struct <code>Solarian</code> has a field <code>health: u64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You might have guessed it by now, but the general advice is:
<strong>Use subtyping in Julia and enums in Rust.</strong>
One caveat though: Enums can not be extended from the “outside”.
If you plan to let users of your library add new type variants, you will have to use some kind of trait approach.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat familiar with Rust or Julia then a large part of this article is probably very obvious to you.
“Of course I use subtyping, that’s what everybody <em>loves</em> Julia for!” or “Of course I use enums, they’re one of <em>the</em> key features of Rust!” you might say.</p>
<p>However, I find it quite surprising that these two – seemingly rather different – patterns can be used in the same situation.
If you are (without loss of generality) a Julia developer, being aware of the corresponding pattern in Rust might help you design appropriate types faster, should you ever get into that situation; and vice versa.</p>

        <article>
          
<p>30 Aug 2020</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet and the ability to self-host content has always been appealing to me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really interested in taking problems and re-working them so that they can be solved without an obvious single point of failure instead of requiring a single central coordinating actor. This can be accomplished using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networking â€” instead of connecting to a single server, one would connect with multiple other peers on their network. Coincidentally, I also enjoy collecting data. Thus, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a></strong> is particularly interesting to me. For this post, I thought I would walk through a conceptual example to help de-mystify how the protocol works.</p>

<p>Upfront warning: there will be a decent amount of hand-waving around the actual networking component of the protocol, since I believe it would just bog down this post (and, realistically, Iâ€™d make a fool of myself).</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>We just finished running an event. Awesome. Maybe it was a conference, an unconference, or somewhere in the middle. It went well and weâ€™re feeling real proud of ourselves. This was also the first year we had talk transcripts as well as a professional photographer. We want to share this content with our organizers! Thereâ€™s one issue thoughâ€¦ the organizers are located all over the world!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of options here â€” you could share a SomeCorpCloudServiceâ„¢ Folderâ€¦ maybe run an FTP serverâ€¦ what about physically mailing USB sticks to everyone? All very plausible options. But youâ€™re hesitating. That sounds like a lot of work for you, whether it be paying money for the storage, making sure a device stays plugged in 24/7, or licking tons of envelopes.</p>

<p>What if there was a way your organizers could help forward along the content to other organizers? Maybe some kind of organizer-to-organizer protocolâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</p>

<h3 id="a-first-attempt">A First Attempt</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think of what we have here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pre-defined list of files we want to share.</li>
  <li>A list of clients (ie. organizers, IP addressesâ€¦ basically the same thing) we want to share these files with. This is called a <strong>swarm</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we develop a simple application. The application will keep track of which files youâ€™ve already downloaded and which ones youâ€™re missing. Itâ€™ll connect you to the swarm and open up individual connections to each person. This might be the entire swarm, or it could be just a few people.</p>

<p>These connections then support the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can announce to the entire swarm which files we have already downloaded. We would do this when we first connect to the swarm, when others connect to the swarm, or when our set of downloaded files changes.</li>
  <li>We can connect to a specific client to send or receive a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process of sharing works by having a client <em>A</em> check which files it is missing, waiting for another client (<em>B</em>) to announce it has the file, and then communicating with client <em>B</em> to receive the file. Then client <em>A</em> would announce that it now has this file for anyone else who might need it. This lets content propagate through our swarm without always needing to get the files from the same person! That way we are not stuck content-less just because client <em>B</em> decided to go to bed early.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a problem here. Someone needs to provide the content initially, otherwise everyone will just be constantly announcing that they have no files. This is called the <strong>initial seed</strong>.</p>

<p>How would this work in practice? Suppose we have four clients involved and we need to share <code>IMG_3051.jpg</code>. Initially thereâ€™s only three clients in the swarm and none of them have the image. But in the shadows there lurks a mythical fourth client who has yet to connect and who has the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene1.svg" alt="Image showing a swarm of three clients missing the file, with a disconnected fourth client possessing the file" width="300px"></p>

<p>When the client connects, it tells everyone which files it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene2.svg" alt="The fourth client joins the swarm announcing it has the image file." width="300px"></p>

<p>And now things start moving! One of our clients has a fast internet connection, hears this message, realizes â€œhey I need that!â€� and asks for the file. The send completes!</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene3.svg" alt="A send occurs for the file and now a second client has the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Now that it has the file, this client decides to re-announce what it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene4.svg" alt="Two clients are now announcing they have the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Time continues flowing. Our remaining clients have now heard both announcements and can receive the file from either client. The <strong>initial seed</strong> could now leave without leaving clients to dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene5.svg" alt="Everyone now has the files, with sends being issued from each client." width="300px"></p>

<p>With this application, we can now share our content peer-to-peer without needing to remain connected the entire time! Others can take up part of the sharing work.</p>

<h3 id="big-files-slow-connections">Big Files, Slow Connections</h3>

<p>The application is working well! Our organizers are slowly getting all of the generated media. Key word being <em>slowly</em>. Youâ€™ve gotten a few reports now that users will occasionally get stuck waiting ages for some of the larger files (RAW images are quite large after all). Not everyone in our swarm has fast internet connections, so the experience can be sub-optimal if you end up requesting a small file from a fast client and a large file from a slow client.</p>

<p>Your first guess here might be to always prioritize selecting the fastest client in the swarm. That sounds reasonableâ€¦ until they get bombarded with requests. Their home connection slows to a crawl. Eventually, they figure out that Netflix is streaming at awful quality due to the application and decide to close it â€” right as someone had downloaded exactly 99% of the image, leaving them unhappy.</p>

<p>A light bulb goes off in your head: <strong>why not split up our files into smaller pieces</strong>? This kills two birds with one stone! It minimizes the impact of slow connectionsâ€¦ downloading 100Kb from a slow connection is less painful than trying to download 100Mb. It also helps avoid re-downloading! If you are on a slow internet connection and already have 99% of a file downloaded and the connection drops all you need to do is download the missing piece instead of re-downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s time to tweak our application â€” version 2.0.</p>

<p>Your application now conceptually splits up each file into <strong>pieces</strong>. Each piece has the same size. The protocol now uses the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can tell the entire swarm which <strong>pieces</strong> we have already downloaded.</li>
  <li>We can send/receive a <strong>piece</strong> for a given connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Picking the piece size actually has an important trade off. As piece size decreases, there are more announces and more file send/receive connections. If your piece size is too low (or too high!), the protocol loses efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-swarm">Growing the Swarm</h3>

<p>Initially, we embedded a list of possible clients in our application. This isnâ€™t the most practical: IP addresses change, organizing teams grow, people want to download the file from multiple devices, etc.</p>

<p>We could develop a centralized <strong>tracker</strong> of peers. This service is responsible for tracking the IP addresses of swarm members, and for providing that list to clients. Our application would register with the tracker on startup and query for available peers. The tracker could periodically send out updates as the swarm changes to keep clients up to date.</p>

<p>This seems less than ideal given our initial goal of offloading as much work as possible and not needing to host anything. Feeling inspired from the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol up to this point, you might get curious and wonder if thereâ€™s a way to exchange swarm information peer-to-peer as well. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash tables</a> are generally used to accomplish this (eg. the BitTorrent protocol uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> system). These approaches all generally require some clients which are always online to bootstrap the search for swarm members, but it provides a way to de-centralize and distribute this work.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-trust-me">Do You Trust Me?</h3>

<p>Up till this point, weâ€™ve trusted all the members of our swarm to send the same files as the <strong>initial seed</strong>. But what if a malicious organizer decides to modify one of the images to make a meme and spreads it masquerading as the original? Alternatively, what if someoneâ€™s connection is flaky and weâ€™re not quite sure we got the right bytes for the image?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve discussed a similar problem in the past when <a href="https://dominic.cr/2020/05/26/merkle_trees/">Verifying Data with Merkle Trees</a>. The core of solving that problem involved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum function</a> on our data and sharing the checksum so that others could verify they had the data we intended.</p>

<p>So we decide to try <strong>embedding a checksum with each file piece</strong> in our application alongside our file piece information. Our application can then verify that any piece received from another client matches the checksum! We can now add untrusted members to the swarm without worrying that they might tamper our file data!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-next-year">What About Next Year?</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ve now established a good conceptual protocol for sharing this type of content. But one part of it is still impractical: so much information is baked directly into the application! Organizers really like the application and would like to use it for other events.</p>

<p>The information we needed to coordinate this dance of file-sharing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of file pieces and their checksums.</li>
  <li>Any information we need to find other swarm members. As an example, this could be the URL for our tracker!</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to put this information in a file and modify our application to accept these files, we could now re-use the protocol arbitrarily! This means our application could download and share multiple sources at once.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is exactly what a <code>.torrent</code> file contains (along with other data). These files are encoded using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">Bencode</a> format in order to allow flexibility and offer some size reduction. Everything youâ€™ve read in this post is actually used in the BitTorrent protocol: the process itself, file pieces, checksumming, and trackers (or trackerless via distributed hash tables). Our application is the equivalent to a BitTorrent client!</p>

<p><strong>Well done - we over-engineered a simple file-sharing problem and built BitTorrent from scratch.</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="aside-encouraging-good-behavior">Aside: Encouraging Good Behavior</h3>

<p>We didnâ€™t really cover a) how to select which clients we interact with and b) how to select which file pieces to get first, but these are both …</p></article></div></div>

August 30, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

        <b><time datetime="2020-08-20 23:14:10+0200">2020-08-20 23:14:10 +0200</time></b>
        <p>This is going to be a rather long post, and I cannot add sources for everything right away. I may add sources at any time 
without a notice (my edit policy still applies for other kinds of edits nevertheless). Note that for some things I might 
never be able to provide sources as these are simply things I heard about in public chatrooms.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#os-security:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com">OS Security room on Matrix</a>, 
in which various operating systems are discussed frequently regarding their security. The thing is, it is not that simple, 
as many that have reached widespread use today are much less secure than you would expect (while others which are also widely 
used are <em>more</em> secure than you might think, if not as secure as expected), and those that are secure basically always have 
some other kinds of drawbacks that are not directly related to security, but may be a dealbreaker nevertheless. I will mainly 
focus on desktop and mobile operating systems here, as servers have a very different quantity and quality of attack surface, 
and security should rather be provided by the often well-written, less complex server software, and isolation is done through 
hypervisors anyway, most of the time, as things like clipboard and file sharing are not that important.</p>
<h2>Some basic terms</h2>
<p>It might occur to you that you are not familiar with some of the terms used here. However, I do not know how I could be 
better at explaining them than Wikipedia is (doing so nevertheless seems redundant), so I decided to just link their 
respective pages for you here. (Note: I would normally not explain many of these if they were used in a shorter blogpost 
without all the others, however, the sheer amount of terminology made me deem it appropriate to explain all of them.)</p>

<li>Verified boot: I will actually explain this one myself, because Wikipedia did not appear to have a good definition. Verified boot allows the boot firmware to prevent bootloaders and kernels that do not have a valid cryptographic signature that corresponds to some specified public key to be loaded. These are then supposed to verify the userland, effectively preventing persistent exploits. Now, there has been some criticism, because many devices only allow particular keys, however, good implementations allow you to unlock them, specify your own keys, and then relock them, meaning user freedom is not impacted by this.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine (VM)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux (or GNU/Linux)</h2>
<p>I do not even know where to start here. Linux distros offer easy to use, fast and versatile OSes, however, the security is 
very lacking.</p>
<h3>Sandboxing</h3>
<p>Linux systems by default have no sandboxing of applications at all, meaning a compromise of one app easily leads to full 
system compromise. Now, there are two "solutions" to this: The app distribution systems Snap and Flatpak. Flatpak, however, 
<a href="https://flatkill.org/">has some quite severe issues with its sandbox</a>, and while I cannot state similar things about Snap, I 
have been told it was not much better, and it has its own set of issues, such as only allowing a single, proprietary app store.</p>
<h3>General hardening and memory safety</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel does not incorporate modern hardening techniques such as CFI, it is a monolithic kernel (which makes 
applying the principle of least privilege basically impossible), it is written in non-memory safe languages (mainly C), and 
the situation for desktop programs does not look that much better.</p>
<h3>GUI stack</h3>
<p><ins>Update: I meant the most commonly used GUI stack. Of course, there is no "default", since GNOME, as well as Wayland 
compositors and Lomiri, default to Wayland or Mir, respectively.</ins></p>
<p>The default GUI stack is X11, which has been said to be rather insecure, even by the developers themselves, as it allows any 
program to view and manipulate input and output from any other program. While Wayland is said to be more secure, <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger">keylogging 
through <code>/proc</code> is still possible</a>.</p>
<p><ins>Update: The mentioned exploit does not use <code>/proc</code>.</ins></p>
<h3>But I always thought Linux was super safe and had almost no bugs?</h3>
<p>The kernel alone contains million lines of code. <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">Syzbot, a bot used for testing Linux and other kernels finds plenty bugs 
every month, and many of them are not fixed</a>.</p>
<h3>Hardened Linux distros</h3>
<p><ins>Update: As mentioned above, the Wayland keylogger relies on the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable, meaning properly 
sandboxed applications may not be able to exploit it. However, the issues with the kernel (which does the majority of the 
sandboxing itself through the namespaces feature), as well as the applications themselves remain.</ins></p>
<p>Actually hardened Linux distros like <a href="https://whonix.org/">Whonix</a> or <a href="https://clip-os.org/en/">CLIP OS</a> do provide better 
security, however they come or will come with restrictions like restricted root or not being able to make files executable 
that were not installed by the package manager, or running any app outside of a restrictive sandbox, due to their use of 
restrictive MAC policies. I also consider it likely that none of them can fix the architectural issues with the kernel and 
GUI stacks, as well as the fact most Linux programs are not designed to be run in a sandbox.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>Android is a Linux-based OS by Google that greatly improves on the security of the latter. All apps run in sandboxes confined 
from each other, it has strong SELinux policies, and several devices feature a full verified boot implementation, in the case of the 
Google Pixel line, it is especially good, as it is possible to use custom keys, as well as both unlocking and relocking the 
bootloader. Memory safe languages like Java and Kotlin are commonplace. It also partially fixes the issue with Linux being a 
monolithic kernel, as it often uses stub drivers in the kernel that actually rely on userspace drivers. Nevertheless, one 
should not overlook issues such as the way it has become a closed ecosystem, with many devices being non-repairable, the use 
of a a very specific, apparently hard to port API (as the fact the Anbox compatibility layer for Linux does not work that 
great shows), and the reliance of many apps on proprietary Google services (though, to be fair, this is less common in apps 
that are free and open source software). Another issue is that neither the apps nor the GUI are really desktop friendly; they 
remain focused on the use on small touchscreens. For security, GrapheneOS, which is based on Android, should be considered.</p>
<h2>ChromiumOS</h2>
<p>ChromiumOS is another OS by Google, based on Linux. Like Android, it uses SELinux policies, and offers isolation of 
desktop apps from the main operating system. However, there is one glaring issue with this: The central elemenet of the system, 
prominently featured in the name, and perhaps the one program with the largest attack surface; the web browser, is only 
isolated by its own sandbox as well as said SELinux policies, and not by the stronger isolation that their own KVM-based 
emulator crosvm offers, which is written in Rust and can thus be considered memory safe. It is also one of the worst 
operating systems for privacy due to <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/login">the way how login is handled</a>.</p>
<h2>BSD</h2>
<p>FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, HardenedBSD and so on all promise secure operating systems. While they are probably not as bad as 
Linux, especially on servers, their security is still lacking, and they have no proper desktop security model at all, mainly 
because they use X11 for a GUI stack, and browsers that have sandboxes elsewhere are not sandboxed here. They still use 
memory unsafe languages and monolithic kernels. <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/">Here</a> is some more information on OpenBSD 
specifically, which, while having improved security for various programs, and utilizing quite a bit more hardening than Linux, 
is not actually as secure as it claims, due to aforementioned issues.
<ins> Update: NetBSD runs some drivers in user space by using a special "rump kernel", which should make them more portable. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbsd#Virtualization">Source</a></ins></p>
<h2>MacOS and iOS</h2>
<p>These are partially open source operating systems by Apple. They both have (locked-down) verified boot implementations, and 
both employ a certain degree of sandboxing for apps. There is not much to say, they are rather good, but the only devices where 
they properly run is Apple ones, which are known for rather bad value and low repairability. The security model, while okay, 
is not too interesting to be honest. Privacy-wise, they are fine if telemetry is disabled, especially considering the fact 
that both the Safari web browser and the sandbox try to minimize tracking that can be conducted by websites and apps, 
respectively.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>The main reasons I see this operating system being liked by the security community include the Hyper-V hypervisor, which 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_51">apparently is supposed to be formally verified</a>, as well as 
Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG), which is supposed to run the Microsoft Edge browser and other applications in a 
specialized VM. Microsoft store apps are also sandboxed, however they are… well, mostly stereotypical apps, and less actual, 
common desktop software. Issues with this one include it is slow, cannot be properly used with a GUI (not that you would want 
to anyway, given how much the Windows command line sucks compared to the one on POSIX/UNIX systems), highly targeted, proprietary, 
costs a lot of money if obtained legally, especially if you want the better versions with more security features and such, and 
is a privacy nightmare out of the box, some of which cannot be disabled in the non-Enterprise/Education versions.</p>
<h2>Qubes OS</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a> is actually one of my favorites, and it is what I used to write this post. It has a 
great desktop security model based on isolating different programs into different VMs, good hardware compatibility due to the 
use of a Linux kernel for drivers, and allows you to run instances of the …</p></article></div></div>

									♦ <a href="https://petersmagnusson.org/2009/09/15/why-are-there-5280-feet-in-a-mile/#comments">10 Comments</a>							</p>

			<p>The original Roman mile was 1000 paces (<em>milia passuum</em>), or 5000 feet. The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Hi everyone! Welcome back to part 8 of our <strong>Blazor 2d Gamedev</strong> series. Today we’ll keep refactoring <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-gamedev-part-8-keyboard-control-animations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our last example</a>, cleaning up the code using a <strong>Finite State Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>As usual, you can check out the <a href="https://mizrael.github.io/BlazorCanvas/BlazorCanvas.Example8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results in your browser</a> before moving on. Use left/right arrows to move the player and the space bar to attack.</p>



<h4>So, what’s a <strong>Finite State Machine</strong>? It’s a computational machine, built from a finite list of states and the list of transitions between them. </h4>



<p>An <strong>FSM </strong>can be exactly in only one of the states and can (possibly) transition into another one after receiving some particular input. This input can be state-specific or global. For more details, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">the excellent article</a> on Wikipedia, it will give for sure a lot of food for thoughts.</p>



<p>Now, how can an <strong>FSM</strong> help us with our game? In a lot of ways actually. The first scenario is getting rid of all those nasty <em>if/else</em> blocks:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public override async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
{
	var right = InputSystem.Instance.GetKeyState(Keys.Right);
	var left = InputSystem.Instance.GetKeyState(Keys.Left);

	if (right.State == ButtonState.States.Down)
	{
		_transform.Direction = Vector2.UnitX;
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Run");
	}
	else if (left.State == ButtonState.States.Down)
	{
		_transform.Direction = -Vector2.UnitX;
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Run");
	}
	else if (right.State == ButtonState.States.Up)
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Idle");
	else if (left.State == ButtonState.States.Up)
		_animationComponent.Animation = _animationsSet.GetAnimation("Idle");
}</pre>



<p>If you remember from our last article, that’s the code handling the animation switching. We’re going to replace that entirely with an <strong>FSM</strong>.</p>



<p>The idea is to have a State for each possible animation of our character (“idle”, “running”, “attack” and so on). Then we’ll define the possible transitions between them. A transition occurs when a specific condition is detected: for example, if we’re <em>idle</em> and our speed is &gt; 0.1 then we transition to “running”.</p>



<p>At every update cycle, the current State will loop the list of its transactions and check the conditions for each one. If one of the predicates is satisfied, the transition occurs. We might even decide to get fancy and assign a weight to the transitions: this way if multiple predicates are true, we’ll pick the one with the highest weight.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the code now. This is the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example8/Core/Components/AnimationState.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimationState</a> <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example8/Core/Components/AnimationState.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">class</a>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AnimationState
{
	private readonly List&lt;Transition&gt; _transitions;
	private readonly AnimationCollection.Animation _animation;

	public async ValueTask Update(AnimationController controller)
	{
		var transition = _transitions.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Check(controller));
		if(null != transition)
			controller.SetCurrentState(transition.To);
	}

	public void Enter(AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent animationComponent) =&gt;
		animationComponent.Animation = _animation;
}</pre>



<p>The Transition class instead looks more or less like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class Transition
{
	private readonly IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;&gt; _conditions;

	public Transition(AnimationState to, IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;&gt; conditions)
	{
		To = to;
		_conditions = conditions ?? Enumerable.Empty&lt;Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;&gt;();
	}

	public bool Check(AnimationController controller)
	{
		return _conditions.Any(c =&gt; c(controller));
	}

	public AnimationState To { get; }
}</pre>



<p>As you can see, the list of conditions is a collection of predicates, accepting as input an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/blob/develop/BlazorCanvas.Example8/Core/Components/AnimationController.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimationController class</a>, which represents our FSM:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AnimationController : BaseComponent
{
	private readonly IList&lt;AnimationState&gt; _states;
	private AnimationState _defaultState;
	private AnimationState _currentState;
	private readonly AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent _animationComponent;
	private readonly IDictionary&lt;string, float&gt; _floatParams;
	private readonly IDictionary&lt;string, bool&gt; _boolParams;

	public AnimationController(GameObject owner) : base(owner)
	{
		_states = new List&lt;AnimationState&gt;();
		_animationComponent = owner.Components.Get&lt;AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent&gt;() ??
							  throw new ComponentNotFoundException&lt;AnimatedSpriteRenderComponent&gt;();

		_floatParams = new Dictionary&lt;string, float&gt;();
		_boolParams = new Dictionary&lt;string, bool&gt;();
	}


	public void AddState(AnimationState state)
	{
		if (!_states.Any())
			_defaultState = state;
		_states.Add(state);
	}

	public override async ValueTask Update(GameContext game)
	{
		if (null == _currentState)
		{
			_currentState = _defaultState;
			_currentState.Enter(_animationComponent);
		}

		await _currentState.Update(this);
	}

	public void SetCurrentState(AnimationState state)
	{
		_currentState = state;
		_currentState?.Enter(_animationComponent);
	}

	public float GetFloat(string name) =&gt; _floatParams[name];

	public void SetFloat(string name, float value)
	{
		if(!_floatParams.ContainsKey(name))
			_floatParams.Add(name, 0f);
		_floatParams[name] = value;
	}

	public void SetBool(string name, in bool value)
	{
		if (!_boolParams.ContainsKey(name))
			_boolParams.Add(name, false);
		_boolParams[name] = value;
	}

	public bool GetBool(string name) =&gt; _boolParams[name];
}</pre>



<p>The <em>AnimationController</em> holds the list of States, plus some <em>custom parameters</em>. We can use those to store some relevant information about the current state of the player. Later on, we can leverage them when creating the transition predicates:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">var animationController = new AnimationController(warrior);
animationController.SetFloat("speed", 0f);

var idle = new AnimationState(animationCollection.GetAnimation("Idle"));
animationController.AddState(idle);

var run = new AnimationState(animationCollection.GetAnimation("Run"));
animationController.AddState(run);

idle.AddTransition(run,new Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;[]
{
	ctrl =&gt; ctrl.GetFloat("speed") &gt; .1f
});

run.AddTransition(idle, new Func&lt;AnimationController, bool&gt;[]
{
	ctrl =&gt; ctrl.GetFloat("speed") &lt; .1f
});</pre>



<p>That’s all for today. Next time we’ll see what a Scene Graph is and how we can use it to handle our Game Objects.</p>

<p>Zero To Production focuses on the challenges of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-05-24-zero-to-production-0-foreword/">writing Cloud-native applications with Rust</a>.<br>
Zero To Production is built around the idea of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">problem-based learning</a>: choose a problem you want to solve, let the problem drive the introduction of new concepts and techniques.<br>
Our problem is <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/"><em>building an email newsletter</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first part of <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-08-09-zero-to-production-3-how-to-bootstrap-a-new-rust-web-api-from-scratch/">Chapter 3</a> we covered a fair amount of ground - we set out to implement a <code>/health_check</code> endpoint and that gave us the opportunity to learn more about the fundamentals of our web framework, <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/"><code>actix-web</code></a>, as well as the basics of (integration) testing for Rust APIs.</p>

<p>It is now time to capitalise on what we learned to finally fulfill the <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-06-21-zero-to-production-2-learn-by-building-an-email-newsletter/">first user story of our email newsletter project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect our blog visitors to input their email address in a form embedded on a web page.<br>
The form will trigger a <code>POST</code> <code>/subscribtions</code> call to our backend API that will actually process the information, store it and send back a response.</p>

<p>We will have to dig into:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to read data collected in a HTML form in <code>actix-web</code> (i.e. how do I parse the request body of a <code>POST</code>?);<br></li>
<li>what libraries are available to work with a PostgreSQL database in Rust (<code>diesel</code> vs <code>sqlx</code> vs <code>tokio-postgres</code>);<br></li>
<li>how to setup and manage migrations for our database;<br></li>
<li>how to get our hands on a database connection in our API request handlers;<br></li>
<li>how to test for side-effects (a.k.a. stored data) in our integration tests;<br></li>
<li>how to avoid weird interactions between tests when working with a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all goes well, we should be able to demo the subscription page at the end of the article.<br>
Let’s get started!</p>

<p>The source code of our email newsletter project is on <a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production/">GitHub</a>!<br>

<h2 id="2-1-refining-our-requirements">2.1. Refining Our Requirements</h2>

<p>What information should we collect from a visitor in order to enroll them as a subscriber of our email newsletter?</p>

<p>Well, we certainly need their email addresses (it is an <em>email</em> newsletter after all).<br>
What else?</p>

<p>This would usually spark a conversation among the engineers on the team as well as the product manager in your typical business setup. In this case, we are both the technical leads and the product owners so we get to call the shots!</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, people generally use throwaway or masked emails when subscribing to newsletters (or, at least, most of you did when <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/subscribe/">subscribing to Zero To Production</a>!).<br>
It would thus be nice to collect a <code>name</code> that we could use for our email greetings (the infamous <code>Hey {{subscriber.name}}!</code>) as well as to spot mutuals or people we know in the list of subscribers.<br>
We are not cops, we have no interest in the <code>name</code> field being <em>authentic</em> - we will let people input whatever they feel like using as their identifier in our newsletter system: <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/"><code>DenverCoder9</code></a>, we welcome you.</p>

<p>It is settled then: we want an email address and a name for all new subscribers.</p>

<p>Given that the data is collected via a HTML form, it will be passed to our backend API in the body of a <code>POST</code> request. How is the body going to be encoded?<br>
There are a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">few options available</a> when using HTML forms: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is the most suitable to our usecase.<br>
Quoting MDN web docs, with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the keys and values [in our form] are encoded in key-value tuples separated by ‘&amp;‘, with a ‘=’ between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example: if the name is <code>Le Guin</code> and the email is <code>ursula_le_guin@gmail.com</code> the <code>POST</code> request body should be <code>name=le%20guin&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</code> (spaces are replaced by <code>%20</code> while <code>@</code> becomes <code>%40</code> - a reference conversion table can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP">here</a>).</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>if a valid pair of name and email is supplied using the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format the backend should return a <code>200 OK</code>;<br></li>
<li>if either name or email are missing the backend should return a <code>400 BAD REQUEST</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-2-capturing-our-requirements-as-tests">2.2. Capturing Our Requirements As Tests</h2>

<p>Now that we understand better what needs to happen, let’s encode our expectations in a couple of integration tests.</p>

<p>Let’s add the new tests to the existing <a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production/blob/master/chapter03-0/tests/health_check.rs"><code>tests/health_check.rs</code> file</a> - we will re-organise our test suite folder structure afterwards.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><code>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing</code> is an example of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests"><em>table-driven test</em></a> also known as <em>parametrised test</em>.<br>
It is particularly helpful when dealing with bad inputs - instead of duplicating test logic several times we can simply run the same assertion against a collection of known invalid bodies that we expect to fail in the same way.<br>
With parametrised tests it is important to have good error messages on failures: <code>assertion failed on line XYZ</code> is not great if you cannot tell which specific input is broken! On the flip side, that parametrised test is covering a lot of ground so it makes sense to invest a bit more time in generating a nice failure message.<br>
Test frameworks in other languages sometimes have native support for this testing style (e.g. <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html">parametrised tests in <code>pytest</code></a> or <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-parameterised-tests-in-xunit-with-inlinedata-classdata-and-memberdata/"><code>InlineData</code> in xUnit for C#</a>) - there are a few crates in the Rust ecosystem that extend the basic test framework with similar features, but unfortunately they do not interop very well with the <code>#[actix_rt::test]</code> macro that we need to write asynchronous tests idiomatically (see <a href="https://github.com/la10736/rstest/issues/85"><code>rstest</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/frondeus/test-case/issues/36"><code>test-case</code></a>).</p>

<p>Let’s run our test suite now:</p>

</div>
<p>As expected, all our new tests are failing.<br>
You can immediately spot a limitation of “roll-your-own” parametrised tests: as soon as one test case fails, the execution stops and we do not know the outcome for the following tests cases.</p>

<p>Let’s get started on the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-parsing-form-data-from-a-post-request">2.3. Parsing Form Data From A <code>POST</code> Request</h2>

<p>All tests are failing because the application returns a <code>404 NOT FOUND</code> for <code>POST</code> requests hitting <code>/subscriptions</code>. Legitimate behaviour: we do not have a handler registered for that path.<br>
Let’s fix it by adding a matching route to our <code>App</code> in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

							
<h2>Begin With: Why Do You Need To Build Software?</h2>



<p>There are a many reasons why an organization needs to build and deliver software. Some examples might be:</p>



<ul><li>Grow integrated strategic partnerships</li><li>Improve internal proprietary processes</li><li>Quality assurance and business intelligence</li><li>Build products and tools that customers will use directly</li></ul>



<p>Taking the time to understand the “why” can help you determine how to structure a delivery team and establish long term plans. In many cases an organization may find it has multiple answers to the “why” and this could be a good indicator that a team for each might be a good idea.</p>



<h2>Create Aligned Work Streams vs Functional Groups</h2>



<p><br>Before we can dive into the 4 components that make a delivery team successful, we need to address team structure. For years many organizations structured software development teams by the “how” instead of “why”.&nbsp; For example –&nbsp; QA experts and engineers were divided into groups. I’m sure some of the thought process was to build competency within an organization. Unless you are offering those services directly to customers – your goals shouldn’t be building a stellar “QA” or “Engineering” team. You want a high performing “delivery” teams that just happen to be composed of individuals in these roles. Consider objective first, software creation second. Think diversity of perspectives – putting people with different skill-sets and roles together for a common goal will cultivate continuous improvement.</p>



<h2>The 4 Components</h2>



<p>I’m going to attempt to describe each component and then give examples of ways a team can implement each one. Understand that every organization and workstream may be different – so not all may apply.</p>



<h2><br>Build</h2>



<div><p>Build is traditionally measured by how well your organization can produce technology that can scale, can be maintained cost effectively, and functions consistently.&nbsp; In addition to these considerations I would also include flexibility. A build team that understands how to work iteratively – applying the correct level of technology &amp; effort to deliver what is necessary is key.&nbsp;The ability to produce quality software in a predictable way is the result of multiple aligned efforts.</p><p><strong>Application Portfolio Management &amp; Support:</strong>&nbsp; In order to continue building you have to consider what has been built already. One mistake many organizations make is creating dedicated support teams that are not aligned with a work stream. The result is a disenfranchised team and a pile of technology that eats up resources. A team that doesn’t manage its portfolio will also run into serious tech debt issues – ultimately impacting its ability to deliver. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/itana/TIME+Models" target="_blank">&nbsp;(TIME) Tolerate | Invest | Maintain | Eliminate</a></p></div>



<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> In my mind the greatest contributor to effective delivery is the ability to ship code safely and effortlessly. Thinking back to days when I had to deal with 45 minute builds, complex manual deployment processes, and terrifying testing procedures – this is an easy one in my book. I also believe this is an enabler for organizations with on-prem technology that want to get to the cloud. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf" target="_blank">State Of DevOps (Google)</a></p>



<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> This requires a role that specializes in regression and user acceptance testing. Some of this can also be automated but nothing replaces an individual with domain knowledge that can find bugs. The level of QA necessary for a work stream is dependent on the level of acceptable risk. Ex – financial or healthcare processing will need more QA that a startup still looking for product market fit. <em>Further Reading: </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing_tactics" target="_blank">Software Testing Tactics</a></p>



<p><strong>Software Development: </strong>An obvious component of build – a good development team is critical to executing.&nbsp; Software craftsmanship concepts such as TDD and SOLID are game changers when attempting to deliver high quality software quickly.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a><strong> | </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a></p>



<h2>Learn</h2>



<p>You must inform your build effort, otherwise you will produce technology that is of little value (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://7samurai.dev/2020/08/24/how-to-deliver-meaningful-software/" data-type="post" data-id="20" target="_blank">meaningless</a>). You do this by growing the collective knowledge of the team. It’s important to understand that one person or one role isn’t solely responsible for this on well functioning teams. Every member should have the freedom to contribute. <strong><p>User Experience Research:</p></strong> This role is an absolute must for product focused work streams.&nbsp; Creation of user personas, qualitative &amp; quantitative research, and structured user interviews are all important if an organization wishes to build products that provide real value. This role also places a high emphasis on creating value by understanding the behaviors and needs of users. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions" target="_blank">User Experience Definitions&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><strong>Business Analysis:</strong> While UX focuses on users, BA roles tend to focus on business and process.&nbsp; The type of work stream again determines the importance of this role on the team. Business analysts also tend to retain and build domain knowledge. This can be critical as well if your work stream is heavy on complex business processes. Practices such as process mapping and requirements gathering are extremely valuable when dealing with complex workflows and business needs. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Whys </a><strong>&nbsp;| </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MoSCoW</a></p>



<p><br><strong>Technical Analysis &amp; Design:</strong> Commonly misunderstood or ignored this role is a must have on teams that maintain and enhance large systems or a large number of applications. Sometimes domain knowledge lives within code and the only way to re-discover requires a deep dive into the code.&nbsp; In most cases this needs to be an experienced developer who can translate code into requirements (or at minimum technical specifications). Some organizations attempt to avoid this by producing large volumes of documentation – in many cases it’s not a viable solution.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/not-everything-needs-to-be-a-user-story-using-fdd-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Using FDD Features</a></p>



<h2>Promote</h2>



<p>Once you build something you need to ensure that its value is understood by stakeholders and users. I consider this effort one of the 4 pillars because without it you don’t receive feedback or traction. Unused software is meaningless software – even if it “could” offer value. There is strong overlap in this area with general sales and marketing but this is outside the scope of “software delivery”.</p>



<div><p><strong>Demos</strong>: One way you can promote internally is via “Demo Days”. Showing new functionality to stakeholders and team members creates conversations which generates internal feedback loops. This ensures that everyone understands the value. Also, this also offers an opportunity to team members who wish to build communication and speaking skills. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://dev.acquia.com/blog/how-to-give-a-great-agilescrum-sprint-demo/09/08/2018/19771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Give a Great Agile/Scrum Sprint Demo</a></p><p><strong>Roadmaps</strong>:&nbsp; Communicating the direction of the team to the organization is important. Hopefully it can provide a source of excitement and inspiration for the entire organization. A well communicated roadmap in conjunction with a good company culture should result in aligned efforts and a shared vision.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em>&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HReut5aIndOczY3sD6JQhowRIrmp44RcvjnT28mzfBM/edit#slide=id.g23c0d64254_0_16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department Of Product: Roadmaps</a><br><strong><br>Customer Experience</strong>: Ensuring that customers can easily understand and utilize features the team has created – in conjunction with the offering as a whole ensures that engagement can scale as the product becomes more complex (and/or integrated).&nbsp; I consider this “promotion” because creating a good customer experience is a form of promoting the underlying value provided by the platform.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-cx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Experience vs. Customer Experience</a></p></div>



<h2>Core</h2>



<p>Now we get to the really fun part. Putting it all together. While the other 3 components can vary based on organizational structure and work stream needs – these items are non-negotiable if you wish to successfully deliver meaningful software.</p>



<p><strong>Ownership:&nbsp;</strong> Without strategic direction a team is very likely to focus on small items that don’t line up with larger objectives (although I do think it’s possible for teams to become aligned – a topic for another time). Decision makers need to be responsible for collecting information from all 3 components, weave in considerations from leadership, and set a course. Among the many decisions to be made lies the most critical – platform and feature prioritization.&nbsp; <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams</a></p>



<p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong>&nbsp; A team that wants to deliver meaningful software must strive to be better on both a team and individual level. The only way this works however is if the team defines and measures continuous improvement goals on its own. An autonomous team that has the freedom to test (and fail) in an effort to improve will produce consistently better results long term. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://retromat.org/en/?id=43-133-10-73-60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RetroMat</a></p>



<p><strong>Work Agreements:</strong> Informed by continuous improvement, this can include work visualization, code quality practices, ceremonies, definition of done, and other “contracts” among team members. The importance of mutually agreed upon expectations is it removes frustration from the day to day. A good example of this is user stories. A great format for collecting requirements and managing the work – but the real value is its ability to transfer knowledge among multiple team members and roles in a well understood format. Add the ability to visualize priority and progress and the team finds itself aligned. Also keep in mind, while the agreements may be rigid in  definition your continuous improvement efforts should allow for them to change easily when necessary. <em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/Agile_Meetings_Goals_and_Benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agile Meetings – Goals and Benefits </a>| <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanban vs. Scrum</a></p>

<p>Below is a look at the past 30+ years of San Francisco Bay Area real estate boom and bust cycles. Financial-market cycles have been around for hundreds of years, all the way back to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600’s. While future cycles will vary in their details, the causes, effects and trend lines are often quite similar. Looking at cycles gives us more context to how the market works over time and where it may be going — much more than dwelling in the immediacy of the present with excitable pronouncements of “The market’s crashing and won’t recover in our lifetimes!” or “The market’s crazy hot and the only place it can go is up!”</p>
<p>Note: Most of these charts generally apply to higher-priced Bay Area housing markets, such as those found in much of San Francisco, Marin, Central Contra Costa (Lamorinda &amp; Diablo Valley) and San Mateo Counties. (Different market price segments had bubbles, crashes – or adjustments – and recoveries of differing magnitudes in the last cycle, which is addressed at the end of this report.)</p>
<p><u>Regardless of how recent cycles have played out, it is vital to understand how extremely difficult it is to predict, with any accuracy, when different parts of a cycle will begin or end.</u>&nbsp;Boom times can go on much longer than expected, or get second winds; recessions or crashes can appear with startling suddenness. It should also be noted that all of the major down cycles in the Bay Area in recent decades have been tied to national or international economic factors, i.e. our cycles aren’t simply local events, separated from the rest of the state or country. However, it is true that local factors sometime exacerbate a downturn (the earthquake of 1989; our greater exposure to the dotcom bubble), or supercharge a recovery (the Bay Area high-tech boom of recent years).</p>

Whatever the phase of the cycle, up or down, while it is going on people think it will last forever. Going up, it’s never going to stop! And then every time the market goes down, the consensus becomes that real estate will not recover for decades (or even “in our lifetimes”). But the economy mends, the population grows, people start families, inflation builds up over the years, and repressed demand of those who want to own their own homes builds up. In the early eighties, mid-nineties and in 2012, after about 4 years of a recessionary housing market, this repressed demand jumped back in (or “explodes” might be a good description) and prices started to rise again. (The dotcom bubble adjustment caused no lasting recession in home values.)</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for a big surge in values to occur in the first couple of years after a recovery begins, often quickly exceeding the previous peak value.</p>
<p>All bubbles are ultimately based on irrational exuberance and/or criminal behavior, whether exemplified by junk bonds, Savings &amp; Loan frauds, dotcom stock hysteria, “Dow 30,000” insanity, “the end of the business cycle” nonsense, gorging on unsustainable debt, runaway greed (without any corresponding desire to produce anything of value), predatory lending, or dishonest financial engineering.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the most recent subprime-financing/ loan-fraud bubble was truly abnormal in its scale, and its crash was much greater than other “market adjustments” going back many decades. The pre-2008 bubble was fueled by tens of millions of buyers purchasing (or owners refinancing) homes with loans that they clearly&nbsp;<em>couldn’t afford</em>&nbsp;right from the get go: Liar loans, deceptive teaser rates, promises of non-stop appreciation, and the abysmal decline in underwriting standards. (Since lenders were simply selling the loans, they didn’t care about qualifying buyers anymore.) Sometimes there was no actual investment in the properties being bought, i.e. no down payment, 100%+ loans. Many lenders and mortgage brokers clearly engaged in criminally predatory behavior, convincing people to overload themselves with unsustainable, impossible-to-pay-back levels of debt. (Sadly, something similar has been going on in recent years with college loans.)</p>
<p>The market adjustments of the early 1990’s and that subsequent to the dotcom bubble saw declines in home values in the range of 10% to 11%, which is of a&nbsp;<em>completely different scale</em>&nbsp;from the recent 2008 – 2011 crash and decline, when values plunged by up to 60% around the state and country, depending on area and price segment. The previous crash of a similar magnitude was during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.</p>
<p><u>This is important context when contemplating the next adjustment</u>: It doesn’t have to be a devastating crash. It can be more like some air being let out of an over-pressurized tire instead of a blowout on the highway at high speed. As of early-2017, it appears that the SF economy and housing market have cooled to some degree after 4 years of feverish appreciation. But the change varies by segment: The affordable house segment remains quite hot; more expensive house prices have generally plateaued; the condo market has cooled much more and seen price declines, and the luxury condo market has cooled the most. The condo market has been affected by the surge of new-construction condos hitting the market recently. We will have to wait and see the scale and speed of any further adjustment, but so far, we don’t see local or macro-economic conditions for a 2008-like crash. Adjustment, yes; devastating crash, no.

<p>The light blue columns in the above chart graph the home-value appreciation that occurred in the&nbsp;<u>first three years</u>&nbsp;of each recovery – our latest rebound has been somewhat quicker than other recoveries, probably due to 1) the depth of the previous market decline, and 2) the huge, high-tech employment, population and wealth boom that has played out in San Francisco and nearby counties. The gray columns chart the appreciation of past recoveries from the beginning to&nbsp;<em>peak value</em>&nbsp;for each cycle (except for the latest cycle, for which the peak has not yet been defined), and the red bars delineate the percentage declines from those peaks, pursuant to the market adjustments that occurred. As always, note that market appreciation and depreciation rates can vary widely by county, community and neighborhood.</p>
<p>Over the past 30+ years, the period between a recovery beginning and a bubble popping (or a lesser adjustment occurring) has run 5 to 7 years. We are currently about 5 years into the current recovery, which started in early 2012 (in San Francisco; later in outlying Bay Area counties). Periods of market recession/doldrums following the popping of a bubble have typically lasted about 3-4 years. (The 2001 dotcom bubble/ 9-11 crisis drop being the exception.) Generally speaking, within about 2-3 years of a new recovery commencing, previous peak values (i.e. those at the height of the previous bubble) are re-attained — among other reasons, there is the recapture of inflation during the doldrums years. In this current recovery, those homes hit hardest by the subprime loan crisis — typically housing at the lowest end of the price scale in the less affluent neighborhoods, which experienced by far the biggest bubble and biggest crash — are appreciating quickly now, but taking longer to re-attain peak values. However, communities with higher priced homes — such as in San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo and Central Contra Costa Counties (Diablo Valley &amp; Lamorinda) — have surged well past their previous peaks.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these recently recurring time periods necessarily reflect some natural law in housing market cycles, or that they can be relied upon to predict the future. Real estate markets can be affected by a bewildering number of local, national and international economic, political and even natural-event factors that are exceedingly difficult or even impossible to predict with any accuracy.</p>
<p>In the 2 charts below tracking the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for the 5-County San Francisco Metro Area, the data points refer to home values as a percentage of those in January 2000. January 2000 equals 100 on the trend line: 66 means prices were 66% of those in January 2000; 175 signifies prices 75% higher.</p>

<p>In the above chart, the country is just coming out of the late seventies, early eighties recession featuring terrible inflation, stagnant economy (“stagflation”) and incredibly high interest rates (hitting 18%). As the economy recovered, the housing market started to appreciate and this surge in values began to accelerate deeper into the decade. Over 6 years, the market appreciated about 100%. Finally, the late eighties “Greed is good!” version of irrational exuberance — junk bonds, stock market swindles, the Savings &amp; Loan implosion, as well as the late 1989 earthquake here in the Bay Area — ended the party.</p>
<p>Recession arrived, home prices sank about 11%, sales activity plunged and the market stayed basically flat for 4 to 5 years. Still, even after the decline, home values were 70% higher than when the boom began in 1984.</p>

<p><i>Me when I have something more important I need to do</i></p>

<p>I am a serial procrastinator. If I have something I want to do, like work on a side project or write something, I will find ways to anything else except that. I go through phases where I can keep myself somewhat focused, but I always seem to drift back into my old bad habits after awhile. Recently though, I’ve started finding ways to turn this procrastination time into something better, what I’ll call “productive procrastination”.</p>

<p>My usual activity when I’m wasting time is watching people play video games on Twitch, or just watching whatever comes up in my Youtube feed. This time is completely useless. I don’t learn any new skills, I don’t grow as a person, and I can’t even discuss it later with friends because nobody I know watches this stuff. This is just pure time annihilation, that time just disappears from my life leaving me nothing to show for it, as if it never existed to begin with.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve started finding ways to channel my brain’s craving for distraction and avoidance into activities that <em>do</em> have some benefits. I’d still rather I could stay focused on what I want to work on, but this time it isn’t a complete waste, and might even have the potential to be life-changing. My new addictions are learning Ukulele and cycling, although not at the same time (yet!).</p>

<p>My newfound love of Ukulele came as a real surprise to me. My girlfriend bought me a cheap Ukulele about a month ago almost as a joke gift, and I started watching some Youtube videos to see if I could at least learn how to to play something really basic. I’ve never played a musical instrument before, and I always assumed I just never would. Growing up there were people who did music, and those who didn’t, and I was always firmly in the latter camp. But for whatever reason, I’ve found Ukulele really addicting. Whenever I feel that wall of mental resistance to doing the task at hand, I just pick up the Ukulele and start trying to learn some new chords, or try playing a new song. It’s a perfect size to be able to just have next to me whenever I’m at my apartment, and I can see progress really quickly. Most importantly, my brain treats it as a fun distraction, so I’ve been able to sneak Ukulele practice in instead of my usual binge Twitch watching. Now while I’m procrastinating I’m learning a real skill, and feel like there’s a whole world of music that might be just around the corner if I keep it up. Who knows, maybe I could even join a band someday!</p>

<p>My other new distraction has been cycling. Cycling was something I used to love years ago, but since moving around and living in tiny apartments I’ve never owned a bike. Now, with the covid lockdowns and my reaching the limits of my sanity staying inside my tiny apartment all day every day, I decided to get a tiny folding bike. Since then biking has become my go-to way of distracting myself when I should be doing something else. Now at least I’m getting good exercise and discovering all sorts of new places around me I’ve never even known exist. I can go on rides with friends and who knows, maybe I’ll even join a biking group once things start calming down and get some social contact out of it. Instead of feeling sick and disgusted with myself laying on the couch watching hours of Youtube nonsense with glazed over eyes, I can come back from a several hour long ride feeling refreshed and amazing. Still, I’d rather I could keep myself focused, but if not at least I can stay healthy in the process!</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize not all time spent procrastinating is equal. There’s definitely a hierarchy of how I can spend my time while still distracting my brain, and I’ve started trying to nudge myself into these higher-value activities when I need a break. I’m still procrastinating, but I’m doing it productively!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"> <article>   <p>When I started managing about a decade ago I was terrible for the reasons many founders are: I’m my own biggest critic. I have extremely high expectations for myself, and as a result have high expectations for others. The frustration of incompetence blinded me from seeing the problem for what it was.</p> <p>It took me years to learn that there’s a separation between the words you <em>want</em> to say and the words that <em>get the job done</em>. I realized humans are systems, and if someone isn’t performing, I needed to fix the root cause, not complain about the proximal issue. Also, while actions might be globally irrational, they are always locally rational to the actor. The employee thinks they’re doing the right thing.</p> <p>Rage doesn’t work. What I learned does work (after years of trying) is curiosity. Curiosity about what caused the person to make a mistake.</p> <ul> <li>“Not productive enough” -&gt; Do they feel too restricted in their role to be productive?</li> <li>“Too distracted” -&gt; How clear is it to them what <em>you</em> want them to do?</li> <li>“Demoralizing the team” -&gt; Why are they unhappy, in general?</li> </ul> <p>It becomes interesting not just to understand the deeper issue, but to brainstorm how you might construct the most compelling reality <em>for them</em>. A CEO is like a dream architect in Inception, and your “IC work” is designing a thrilling environment for everyone to dream in.</p> <p>A good prompt I use is just that – “How can I make this <em>awesome</em> for X?”. Try it next time instead of complaining. It works!</p> <h3 id="millennials">Millennials</h3> <p>I’ve also swung in the opposite direction, constantly feeling insecure that – <em>heaven forbid</em> – an engineer might find their work boring for an hour or two.</p> <p>While you do need to direct a movie for your team that’s broadly exciting, it does not need to be a Christopher Nolan $500M epic thriller. Even the CEO does boring work. Boring work is fine.</p> <p>It took me a while to understand that I’m allowed to say things like “I need you to do X for me”. This is even ideal at certain moments. People want a leader that comports themselves with gravitas and authority. (These “sudo” moments have a certain cost to them. It shouldn’t be the majority of your interactions, but it certainly can be some.)</p> <p>And if not, there is plenty of capable engineering talent around the world that will happily be paid to do the work. Silicon Valley, while mostly being a tremendously positive cultural exporter, has also bred a generation of talent that has an adversarial relationship with work. A cohort of developers that grew up with so much excess, it views work as something to do the bare minimum of, instead of take pride in. (I find these people very easy to screen for: they’re simply unhappy in general.)</p> <h3 id="closing">Closing</h3> <p>If they aren’t performing, take a breath, quell the rage, and ask yourself “why”. And feel free to ask people to work if you employ them.</p> </article>   </div></div>]]>

				<div>
			<p>Every few months I have to delete my twitter app off my phone. Otherwise I might fall prey to ‘Social Media Empathy Burnout Fatigue Syndrome’. This isn’t really a thing. It’s a combination of ‘<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-made-practical/201911/how-avoid-empathy-burnout">empathy burnout</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/are-we-suffering-from-social-media-fatigue-573f99b5df30">social media fatigue</a>‘. Two terms that I’ve come across to describe the fallout of constantly checking our social media feeds. We can’t help but feel empathy and a significant degree of fatigue as we scan every update and reaction. Right now with emotions about to reach fever pitch at election time, it’s going to get a lot worse. There are good reasons to love social media. For instance if I need to immediate information (like how bad the fires are in the bay area), I can get a real time feed like no other source. Many times you can sneak a heads up on something important and get ahead of it, e.g. stocking up on toilet paper in a pandemic. But on the flip side we have good reasons to hate it. Any medium that encourages quick fire, short, gut reactions that you can’t take back become quite ugly. And it can come at a high personal cost too.</p>
<h4>Watch out for any medium that stores initial reactions forever</h4>
<p>I tend not to post that often especially if a story is unfolding and I don’t know all the facts. Not so for some people on social media. If you want to see a steady stream of no holds barred gut reactions on display take a look at trending topics, then click on the top or latest tab. You’ll see the unfiltered musings of anyone who happens to be posting about that topic in a snapshot of time. It’s like being in a very large hall with everybody shouting opinions, facts, and cries for help. All of which you can hear them all as you scroll down the feed. But we know first reactions aren’t always right. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Daniel Kahneman’s bestselling book on fast and slow brain thinking</a>. The fast brain is the initial reaction, fast, intuitive and emotional. We need that kind of thinking sometimes when we have to react suddenly and our brain will naturally behave that way like first impressions of a new person. In that type of scenario your brain plays a helpful role in assessing the situation. But you’re rarely in a flight or fight when you’re choosing to post on social media. Sometimes we need the ‘<a href="https://suebehaviouraldesign.com/kahneman-fast-slow-thinking/">slow brain</a>‘ which is deliberate and more logical.</p>
<h4>You can’t help but pick a side</h4>
<p>Most situations don’t demand an instant reaction yet we are enticed into it, even with only sparse background information to hand. Your words are recorded and very possibly amplified. What’s worse is that it’s hard to rescind that first reaction. In fact it’s natural to double down instead. Take for example a new trending story on twitter e.g. shootings at protests. Here are the inevitable turn of events which I’ve based on my own experience when spending too much time on trending topics. A shooting is reported. First the reports claim an initial viewpoint which is usually backed up by videos. It’s easy to believe this is the ultimate story. At this stage you instinctively choose a side maybe biased by a previous political leaning. Other videos emerge maybe from another angle that make you question that initial assessment. Too late you’ve already liked or commented. Once you’ve reacted you’re backed into a corner. Depending on the audience you could be cancelled or you could be celebrated. This could change in a second if even more new contradictory information comes to light. For some people there is confusion and fatigue as you try to reconcile what is really happening. If you didn’t react online, phew, you can save yourself the embarrassment. For others I suspect, it’s a question of searching for information that will corroborate your view because your mind is already made up and you’ve backed a horse.</p>
<h4>How sure can we be of anything online?</h4>
<p>What’s missing for sure is a chance to evaluate with all the real facts presented before you. There’s just no time for that. The medium functions like a trap. The casual remarks you might make with a few people around are not able to be tested in a safe environment. It’s out there for anybody to see and we might come to regret it. We all are prone to form an incorrect and untruthful opinion based on the knowledge we had at that time. The best philosophers throughout history have argued that we can’t be sure we know anything at all. Yet here we are expressing opinions on a medium that preserves our every word and may even amplify it. It can come at a great cost. Twitter famously doesn’t allow you to edit once it’s posted. You can delete but not edit. Unfortunately anyone can screenshot your post so once it’s up there, it’s up there and very difficult to deny. Many have experienced the humiliation of an objectionable long posted tweet which resurfaces years later.</p>
<h4>In real life you can gauge reaction</h4>
<p>In real life you have other indicators alongside an opinion. Perhaps the person has had a few drinks or they look like they’re not fully concentrating – things we can see. Online, all we have is the words, lacking context. After all who checks to see all the great things that person said before or diligently checks their qualifications in an internet minute. In person you have the opportunity to refine what you say in real time as you see the faces and body language of early reactions. It’s a safe place to offer an opinion especially if you’re uncertain and the group is small and close. Online, all those affordances are gone. We’re already suffering from lack of real life interactions in the pandemic and the consequences will become apparent. Being able to discuss and challenge in a face to face situation has been irreplaceable in some creative environments. This might be one of the things that set us back. The same hasty judgements and context lacking comments that we see on social media may seep into our every day work. It might be a smaller hall full of people shouting but it will still have the same distractions and traps. Once you’ve reacted online for work (be it slack or another internal feed), you could still fall prey to back an idea that you feel compelled to defend to the death. Even after new evidence emerges that should sway your opinion. Work or personal, our online behavior plays out in a similar way.</p>
<h4>The burnout and fatigue will make you unproductive</h4>
<p>I’m always more productive once I’ve taken a break from social media – always. It’s hard to stop watching a car crash and it’s hard to stop refreshing a feed when a big event is happening. So without thinking you refresh and scroll in any empty moment. However, your brain needs quiet time to be creative and productive. Filling that time up with the consumption of updates, tidbits of news, opinions, even if harmless and amusing takes away that quiet time to reflect. We’re starting to understand that open desk working is having negative impacts (and it will be interesting to see how home working has served to reverse that). We also need to understand that a busy mind filled with social media distractions in not conducive to productivity. How can we think of new things when our minds are busy processing the constant stream of updates, much of which makes us none the wiser? Empathy burnout and social media fatigue are real things.</p>
<h4>Go on, take a Social Media holiday</h4>
<p>I advocate social media holidays. If you’re at home during this pandemic, and finding it difficult to kick off new projects that you might have the unique opportunity to do while working at home. Ensure you’ve taken steps to create a distraction free working environment. I expect I will install Twitter back on my phone very soon. Until then I will enjoy the freedom of leaving a loud busy hall, full of shouting people into a calm side space for at least a little while.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/4-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>Today CenturyLink/Level(3), a major ISP and Internet bandwidth provider, experienced a significant outage that impacted some of Cloudflare’s customers as well as a significant number of other services and providers across the Internet. While we’re waiting for a post mortem from CenturyLink/Level(3), I wanted to write up the timeline of what we saw, how Cloudflare’s systems routed around the problem, why some of our customers were still impacted in spite of our mitigations, and what appears to be the likely root cause of the issue.</p>
<h3>Increase In Errors</h3>
<p>At 10:03 UTC our monitoring systems started to observe an increased number of errors reaching our customers’ origin servers. These show up as â€œ522 Errorsâ€� and indicate that there is an issue connecting from Cloudflare’s network to wherever our customers’ applications are hosted. </p>
<p>Cloudflare is connected to CenturyLink/Level(3) among a large and diverse set of network providers. When we see an increase in errors from one network provider, our systems automatically attempt to reach customers’ applications across alternative providers. Given the number of providers we have access to, we are generally able to continue to route traffic even when one provider has an issue.</p>

<p>The diverse set of network providers Cloudflare connects to. Source: https://bgp.he.net/AS13335#_asinfo</p>
<h3>Automatic Mitigations</h3>
<p>In this case, beginning within seconds of the increase in 522 errors, our systems automatically rerouted traffic from CenturyLink/Level(3) to alternate network providers we connect to including Cogent, NTT, GTT, Telia, and Tata.</p>
<p>Our Network Operations Center was also alerted and our team began taking additional steps to mitigate any issues our automated systems weren’t automatically able to address beginning at 10:09 UTC. We were successful in keeping traffic flowing across our network for most customers and end users even with the loss of CenturyLink/Level(3) as one of our network providers.</p>

<p>Dashboard Cloudflare’s automated systems recognizing the damage to the Internet caused by the CenturyLink/Level(3) failure and automatically routing around it.</p>
<p>The graph below shows traffic between Cloudflare’s network and six major tier-1 networks that are among the network providers we connect to. The red portion shows CenturyLink/Level(3) traffic, which dropped to near-zero during the incident. You can also see how we automatically shifted traffic to other network providers during the incident to mitigate the impact and ensure traffic continued to flow.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/4-2.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>The sharp spike up at 10:03 UTC was the CenturyLink/Level(3) network failing. Our automated systems immediately kicked in to attempt to reroute and rebalance traffic across alternative network providers, causing the errors to drop in half immediately and then fall to approximately 25 percent of the peak as those paths were automatically optimized.</p>
<p>Between 10:03 UTC and 10:11 UTC our systems automatically disabled CenturyLink/Level(3) in the 48 cities where we’re connected to them and rerouted traffic across alternate network providers. Our systems take into account capacity on other providers before shifting out traffic in order to prevent cascading failures. This is why the failover, while automatic, isn’t instantaneous in all locations. Our team was able to apply additional manual mitigations to reduce the number of errors another 5 percent.</p>
<h3>Why Did the Errors Not Drop to Zero?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there were still an elevated number of errors indicating we were still unable to reach some customers. CenturyLink/Level(3) is among the largest network providers in the world. As a result, many hosting providers only have single-homed connectivity to the Internet through their network.</p>
<p>To use the old Internet as a â€œsuperhighwayâ€� analogy, that’s like only having a single offramp to a town. If the offramp is blocked, then there’s no way to reach the town. This was exacerbated in some cases because CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network was not honoring route withdrawals and continued to advertise routes to networks like Cloudflare’s even after they’d been withdrawn. In the case of customers whose only connectivity to the Internet is via CenturyLink/Level(3), there was no way for us to reach their applications and they continued to see 522 errors until CenturyLink/Level(3) resolved their issue around 14:30 UTC.</p>
<p>The same was a problem on the other (â€œeyeballâ€�) side of the network. Individuals need to have an onramp onto the Internet’s superhighway. An onramp to the Internet is essentially what your ISP provides. CenturyLink is one of the largest ISPs in the United States.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/5-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<p>Source: https://broadbandnow.com/CenturyLink</p>
<p>Because this outage appeared to take all of the CenturyLink/Level(3) network offline, individuals who are CenturyLink customers would not have been able to reach Cloudflare or any other Internet provider until the issue was resolved. Globally, we saw a 3.5% drop in global traffic during the outage, nearly all of which was due to a nearly complete outage of CenturyLink’s ISP service across the United States.</p>
<h3>So What Likely Happened Here?</h3>
<p>While we will not know exactly what happened until CenturyLink/Level(3) issue a post mortem, we can see clues from BGP announcements and how they propagated across the Internet during the outage. BGP is the Border Gateway Protocol. It is how routers on the Internet announce to each other what IPs sit behind them and therefore what traffic they should receive.</p>
<p>Starting at 10:04 UTC, there were a significant number of BGP updates. A BGP update is the signal a router makes to say that a route has changed or is no longer available. Under normal conditions, the Internet sees about 1.5MBs â€“ 2MBs of BGP updates every 15 minutes. At the start of the incident, the number of BGP updates spiked to more than 26MBs of BGP updates per 15 minute period and stayed elevated throughout the incident.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/6-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage">Source: http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/2020.08/UPDATES/</p>
<p>These updates show the instability of BGP routes inside the CenturyLink/Level(3) backbone. The question is what would have caused this instability. The CenturyLink/Level(3) status update offers some hints and points at a flowspec update as the root cause.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-cloudflare-com-assets.storage.googleapis.com/2020/08/7-1.png" alt="Analysis of Today's CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage"></p>
<h3>What’s Flowspec?</h3>
<p>In CenturyLink/Level(3)’s update they mention that a bad Flowspec rule caused the issue. So what is Flowspec? Flowspec is an extension to BGP, which allows firewall rules to be easily distributed across a network, or even between networks, using BGP. Flowspec is a powerful tool. It allows you to efficiently push rules across an entire network almost instantly. It is great when you are trying to quickly respond to something like an attack, but it can be dangerous if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>At Cloudflare, early in our history, we used to use Flowspec ourselves to push out firewall rules in order to, for instance, mitigate large network-layer DDoS attacks. We suffered our own Flowspec-induced outage more than 7 years ago. We no longer use Flowspec ourselves, but it remains a common protocol for pushing out network firewall rules.</p>
<p>We can only speculate what happened at CenturyLink/Level(3), but one plausible scenario is that they issued a Flowspec command to try to block an attack or other abuse directed at their network. The status report indicates that the Flowspec rule prevented BGP itself from being announced. We have no way of knowing what that Flowspec rule was, but here’s one in Juniper’s format that would have blocked all BGP communications across their network.</p>
<pre><code>route DISCARD-BGP {
   match {
      protocol tcp;
      destination-port 179;
   }
 then discard;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Why So Many Updates?</h3>
<p>A mystery remains, however, why global BGP updates stayed elevated throughout the incident. If the rule blocked BGP then you would expect to see an increase in BGP announcements initially and then they would fall back to normal.</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that the offending Flowspec rule came near the end of a long list of BGP updates. If that were the case, what may have happened is that every router in CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network would receive the Flowspec rule. They would then block BGP. That would cause them to stop receiving the rule. They would start back up again, working their way through all the BGP rules until they got to the offending Flowspec rule again. BGP would be dropped again. The Flowspec rule would no longer be received. And the loop would continue, over and over.</p>
<p>One challenge of this is that on every cycle, the queue of BGP updates would continue to increase within CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network. This may have gotten to a point where the memory and CPU of their routers was overloaded, causing an additional set of challenges to getting their network back online.</p>
<h3>Why Did It Take So Long to Fix?</h3>
<p>This was a significant global Internet outage and, undoubtedly, the CenturyLink/Level(3) team received immediate alerts. They are a very sophisticated network operator with a world class Network Operations Center (NOC). So why did it take more than four hours to resolve?</p>
<p>Again, we can only speculate. First, it may have been that the Flowspec rule and the significant load that large number of BGP updates imposed on their routers made it difficult for them to login to their own interfaces. Several of the other tier-1 providers took action, it appears at CenturyLink/Level(3)’s request, to de-peer their networks. This would have limited the number of BGP announcements being received by the CenturyLink/Level(3) network and helped give it time to catch up.</p>
<p>Second, it also may have been that the …</p></div></div>

				<div>
					<div><p>When it comes to online advertising, it’s our experience that digital marketers like you should be using both Google Ads and Display and Video 360 for optimum advertising performance. </p>

<p>After all, many of you have likely seen a positive ROI from your Google Ads campaigns, and we all know that this staple of CPC advertising is a must-have for any business. However, we can safely say that to improve on that ROI, you need to be adding Display and Video 360 to your Google Ads account. </p>

<p>Not only does DV360 allow you to access more advertising networks and third-party data providers, but it gives you more versatility in the advertising campaigns you create. Its powerful creative tools can help you craft stunning ads that you can put in front of your exact target audience, given that it allows you to target more metrics than Google Ads.</p>

<p>In addition, DV360 gives you more control over your advertising budget. You can customize all of your bidding based on your goals, and the ability to input a budget and have the Bid Manager stop when that budget is reached means you’ll always know what you’re spending on your ad campaigns. </p>

<p>However, it would be unrealistic for us to say that DV360 is the perfect solution for every business. </p>

<p>As with any new part of your marketing strategy, we recommend that you test DV360 in parallel to your other advertising campaigns, and in particular to Google Ads, to determine each platform’s ability to deliver a positive ROI. Only then will you be able to determine which advertising platform is the best for your business.

August 30, 2020 | https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A few week ago, I finished implementing support for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md">the WebAssembly reference
types proposal</a> in Wasmtime. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a> is a standalone,
outside-the-Web WebAssembly runtime, and the reference types proposal is
WebAssembly’s first foray beyond simple integers and floating point numbers,
into the exciting world of garbage-collected references. This article will
explain what the reference types proposal enables, what it leaves for future
proposals, and how it is implemented in Wasmtime.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-reference-types">What are Reference Types?</h2>

<p>Without the reference types proposal, WebAssembly can only manipulate simple
integer and floating point values. It can’t take or return references to the
host’s objects like, for example, a DOM node on a Web page or an open connection
on a server. There are workarounds: for example, you can store the host objects
in a side table and refere to them by index, but this adds an extra indirection
and implementing the side table requires cooperating glue code on the host
side. That glue code, in particular, is annoying because it is outside of the
Wasm sandbox, diluting Wasm’s safety guarantees, and it is host-specific. If you
want to use your Wasm module on the Web, in a Rust host, and in a Python host,
you’ll need three separate glue code implementations. This makes WebAssembly
less attractive as a universal binary format.</p>

<p>With the reference types proposal, you don’t need glue code to interact with
host references. The proposal has three main parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code>externref</code> type, representing an opaque, unforgable reference to a
host object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension to WebAssembly tables, allowing them to hold <code>externref</code>s in
addition to function references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New instructions for manipulating tables and their entries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these new capabilities, Wasm modules can talk about host references
directly, rather than requiring external glue code running in the host.</p>

<p><code>externref</code>s play nice with WebAssembly’s sandboxing properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>opaque</em>: a Wasm module cannot observe an <code>externref</code> value’s bit
pattern. Passing a reference to a host object into a Wasm module doesn’t
reveal any information about the host’s address space and the layout of host

    <p>They are <em>unforgable</em>: a Wasm module can’t create a fake host reference out of
thin air. It can only return either a reference you already gave it or the
null reference. It <em>cannot</em> pretend like the integer value <code>0x1bad2bad</code> is a
valid host reference, return it to you, and trick you into dereferencing this
invalid pointer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s a Wasm module that exports a <code>hello</code> function which takes, as an
<code>externref</code> parameter, a reference to an open file and writes “Hello, Reference
Types!” to the file. This module imports the <code>write</code> syscall from a hypothetical
future version of <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, the WebAssembly System Interface, that leverages
reference types.</p>

<p>This Wasm module will run in <em>any</em> WebAssembly environment where WASI is
available.<sup id="back-ref-wasi-available"><a href="#foot-ref-wasi-available">0</a></sup> We don’t need glue code that is
maintaining a side table, mapping host references to indices.</p>

<p>For example, we can run <code>hello.wat</code> from <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/">a Python host

<p>Running <code>hello.wat</code> — once again, without module-specific glue code
— is just as easy in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet/">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a> host
environments, and is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h3>

<p>Unlike the other host environments we’ve considered, WASI isn’t natively
implemented on the Web. There’s nothing stopping us, however, from polyfilling
WASI APIs with a little bit of JavaScript and a couple DOM methods! This is
still an improvement because there is overall less module-specific glue
code. Once one person has written the polyfills, everyone’s Wasm modules can
reuse them.</p>

<p>There are many different things an “open file” could be modeled by on the
Web. For this demo, we’ll use a DOM node: writing to it will append text
nodes. This works well because we know our module is only writing text data. If
we were working with binary data, we would choose another polyfilling approach,
like in-memory array buffers backing the file data.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript code to run our <code>hello.wat</code> module and polyfill our
<code>future-wasi.write</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The DOM node we will use as an "open file".</span>

<p>You can view a live demo of this code in the iframe below. It should work in
Firefox 79+, or any other browser that supports reference types (at the time of
writing, Chrome has support for an older version of the reference types proposal
behind the <code>--experimental-wasm-anyref</code> flag, and Safari has in-progress support
behind the <code>JSC_useWebAssemblyReferences</code> flag.)</p>



<h2 id="what-comes-after-the-reference-types-proposal">What Comes After the Reference Types Proposal?</h2>

<p>The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposal-type-imports/blob/master/proposals/type-imports/Overview.md">WebAssembly type imports proposal</a> builds on
reference types to let you distinguish between different kinds of host objects:
database connections and open files would be separate types. Or, on the Web,
Wasm would distinguish JavaScript <code>Promise</code>s from DOM nodes. It also adds
references that point to types defined by other Wasm modules, not just host
objects.</p>

<p>WASI will want to adopt unforgable reference types for file handles, as the
examples above suggest, instead of using integers. It might make sense for WASI
to wait for type imports, however, so it can use separate types for, say, an
open file and a source of entropy. This is a decision for the WASI subgroup of
the WebAssembly Community Group. Either way, when WASI does make this switch, it
will continue to support integer file descriptors, but implemented inside the
Wasm sandbox as indices into an <code>externref</code> Wasm table.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">interface types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/master/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md">module linking</a> proposals promise to remove even more
glue code and bindings. The interface …</p></div></div>

A lot has changed since I last published my post on handling long-running async tasks in Python using celery. Last time we used it to run a few async tasks to fetch data from some service which took around 1-5 minutes. You can read more about it in the post below.</p>

Although I will still use celery for these types of long-running tasks, there is a subset of tasks that are better handled inside the execution thread itself. Today we will discuss a way of handling such operations.</p>

<p>
To the people who know me, I switched to a new role which allowed me to write Node.js over a year ago and I have been working on it since then. During my time working and building APIs using it, I have started falling for the way in which Node handles Async behavior and long-running tasks.</p>
<p>
The idea is simple, if the task is waiting for some IO, we can run some other task in the mean-time. Only the part that needs it, will wait for it.</p><p>
I wanted to use the same concept in Python. Fortunately, in Python version <code>3.4</code>, they have introduced <code>asyncio</code> for the same purpose. In this post, we are going to talk a little about it and try to understand its importance.</p><p>
By the end of the post, you will be able to understand the importance of async functions and will be able to start using them into your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2><p>
I am using <code>Python 3.8</code> for this tutorial and you might want to use the same to run and try out the examples. You can try them <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">online as well</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-async-function-in-python">Basic async function in Python</h2><p>
This is how we write a basic async function in Python.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>
You have to start by importing the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
Async functions are defined just like a normal function, you just have to add the keyword, <code>async</code>. If you want to wait for the execution of some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines">coroutine</a>, you have to use the keyword, <code>await</code>.</p><p>
Finally, you can run the function using <code>asyncio.run</code> method.</p>
<blockquote>
Anytime you use the await keyword inside the async function, the thread will not move forward until we get a response from the called function.
</blockquote><p>
This simple implementation will not help you understand the advantage of using async functions. In the next section, we will talk about the time taken for the execution and there you will really start to see the difference.</p>
<h2 id="time-taken-for-the-full-execution">Time taken for the full execution</h2><p>
To understand the benefits of using <code>async</code> functions, we will compare the time taken to run the same code in <code>async</code> and <code>sync</code> behavior.</p><p>
Letâ€™s first write the async code.</p>

I have defined 4 different functions doing almost the same thing. Letâ€™s assume there is a long-running function called <code>async_sleep</code> which is doing some IO operation. For example: Fetching data from the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<code>asyncio.gather()</code> is used to run the tasks passed to it concurrently.
</blockquote><p>
The response after running this code is as follows.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>1.1852593421936035</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The function completes the execution somewhere between 1-2 seconds for every execution. (Ran it 5 times to check).</p><p>
Now letâ€™s try to run the <code>sync</code> version of the same code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>


<span>def</span> <span>sync_sleep</span><span>():</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 2: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 3: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 4: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>


<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Completed after: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>))</span>

<span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response that we got after executing this was:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>4.168870687484741</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This saved us <code>~3</code> seconds for executing 4 functions. Now if we wanted to run 10000 such functions, we would save ourselves <code>~2000</code> seconds/ i.e. <code>35-40</code> minutes.</p><p>
Thatâ€™s awesome, right.</p><p>
Even if we are just running 2-3 such functions in each iteration these small savings can be very important to provide better user experience to your customers.</p><p>
Now that we have understood the advantage of using <code>async</code> functions, we must know a few more things about it.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-execution-for-async-functions">Order of execution for async functions</h2><p>
We should understand that while running the functions in async mode, we donâ€™t really know about the order in which functions are executed. Letâ€™s understand the concept with an example.</p><p>
The functions will return as soon as the execution is completed.</p><p>
We can mock the different execution time by sleeping for a random time between 0 and 1 using, <code>random.randint(0, 10) * 0.1</code>.</p><p>
Here is the full code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response to the following code is,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>

<h2 id="practical-usage">Practical Usage</h2><p>
After the release of Python 3.8, which moved the <code>asyncio.run()</code> method to stable API, you can start using it without any problem.</p><p>
The only issue with moving from a <code>synchronous</code> approach to an async one, is to change the way of thinking about the problems. You have to change the way you think about every little detail. Once you reach that point of thinking in terms of async functions, believe me, you will love it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work-under-the-hood">How does it work under the hood?</h2><p>
Letâ€™s check the type of the async function.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span># &lt;class 'coroutine'&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>
So, the async function is of type <code>coroutine</code>.</p><p>
This <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coroutine-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks article</a> does a very good job of explaining coroutines.</p><p>
To sum up what they wrote in the post, <strong>subroutines</strong> are the set of instructions that have one entry point and are executed serially.</p><p>
On the other hand, <strong>Coroutines</strong> can suspend or give away the control to other Coroutines, allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time.</p><p>
Python uses this concept to allow async behavior.</p>
<h2 id="handling-timeout-in-async-functions">Handling timeout in async functions</h2><p>
It is necessary to have a timeout for waiting for the task to get completed. We are not supposed to wait forever for it to complete. <code>asyncio</code> also provided the ability to add a timeout to the async function so that you can skip the execution before its completion.</p><p>
A practical application of this can be a case when you are calling a third party API in your application and the third party itself is down. In that case, you donâ€™t want to wait for a long time.</p><p>
You can use the <code>timeout</code> method to solve your problem. See the code for example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>async_sleep</span><span>():</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Execution completed'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>async_sleep</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Timeout error'</span><span>)</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The async function will raise <code>TimeoutError</code> if the coroutine doesnâ€™t return before the given <code>timeout</code> is passed.</p><p>
Response after executing the above code is</p>
<p>
There are other awesome methods in the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
You can check them at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">pythonâ€™s official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>
If you want to provide a better and faster experience to your users, you can start using the <code>asyncio</code> module in your application. This will definitely help you find cases in which you can reduce the execution time of your API or whatever else that you are doing.</p><p>
Just forcing yourself to write in this way for a few months can yield big returns in the future.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<p>With the increased amount of time I’ve spent in my apartment over the last few months and my new found electronics hobby, I thought it’d be fun to try and automate my studio apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of the apartment (above) in all of it’s 450 square foot glory. </p>



<p>I spend most of my time in the area with my desk, bed, sofa, and television. So, it made sense to focus on making this area as comfortable and usable as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take note of the robotic vacuum cleaner, the standing fan, and the television. I use these devices daily, but more importantly, they all respond to IR signals.</p>



<p>Consequently, I knew if I could decode the signal their IR remotes were sending, I’d be able to create a circuit that could broadcast an identical signal thereby controlling the device. Additionally, with an Amazon Alexa integration, I’d conceivably be able to make all of these devices voice-controlled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Demo</h2>



<p>Here’s a brief demo of the finished project. If you’re interested in seeing the circuit, code, and other implementation details, read on! Not only can I control my TV through Alexa, but also my standing fan and my robot vacuum cleaner. </p>



<figure><p>

<p>Here’s a demo of the fan. Triggering the sleep timer command cycles through the different delay options until the 1, 2, and 4 hour options are all enabled. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, here’s a demo of the robot cleaner returning to the home station when the “dock” command is triggered. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>The first step was identifying the correct IR codes to send which was by far the most involved part of this project. I had seen some other examples online of people trying to reverse engineer the IR codes their remote controls were sending and they were getting back a single clear value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t so lucky. Any remote control key I pressed would give me a slew of possible signal codes – not just one discrete value. </p>



<p>So, in order to find the correct one, I’d press the button I was trying to decode a few times to build up a potential list of valid IR signals. Then, I’d programmatically loop through them slowly to try and identify which IR signal was actually triggering the device. </p>



<blockquote><p>Figuring out what IR encoding the signals were using was another time and research-intensive task.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s the schematic for the IR receiver:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9aIHnUoDInPSudNujmBCmDYByZtYpPrH8BlIoplioo65dvTrtOjfLCUuR3TtyPTuCDumUsERv2tS1FzRuXFZjUmZgkSg8sF2G2Sp0Mh9wuFjmTXxU3RdjseWvq0N9dgRimRriktr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The final circuit is rather simple – an ESP8266 (for WiFi capabilities), a PN2222 transistor, and two IR LEDs. You certainly don’t need 2 IR LEDs, but I wanted greater coverage in the apartment and I had some parts to spare. </p>



<p>You can easily find the parts on Amazon and they’re all just soldered to a spare piece of perfboard.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyV0pAaK6x43Sfc4dHxRnqnMbKefIvrq3aYbgWemNlb22-Bc6VTeGZM-2RPrdC5DaH6xXPZEan9rVfp-V07plvFNwAiNoBELJK1SzJ2k0T7rxlg5dHMmCPN7r3NQhxNmpvs9HeLA" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Though it’s hard to tell in the photo, the two IR LEDs are angled slightly away from one another to increase coverage of the apartment. </p>

<blockquote><p>A few tips if you’re trying to replicate this yourself. </p><p>For a while, I was getting a lot of noise or absolutely no IR values back at all from the IR receiver. I realized that the ambient light was interfering with the IR receiver. So, the simplest solution was just to hide the circuit and the remote control under a blanket while trying to record IR signals to eliminate any noise from ambient light.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure to replace the placeholders in the following code. This code is meant for an ESP8266, but should also be compatible with an ESP32. &nbsp;There’s certainly cleaner ways of writing this code, but my focus was on creating a proof of concept. </p>







<blockquote><p>For the “clean up” and “dock” commands, I repeat the signal at regular intervals in the hopes that the robot vacuum cleaner is in the line of sight of the circuit at one of those time intervals. Unlike all of the other devices, the location of the robot isn’t static.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, I had a circuit that was capable of controlling the main devices in my apartment. The next step was the Alexa integration. </p>



<h2>Alexa Integration</h2>



<p>The first issue I ran into was how to establish a connection between the Alexa and the ESP8266. Both were on the same local network, but I couldn’t find a way of setting up Alexa to make a local web request. Initially, it seemed like configuring port forwarding on my router was the only option and I wasn’t too keen on doing that. </p>



<p>Eventually, after a bit more research, I realized that Alexa could talk to <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IFTTT</a> and that IFTTT had an <a href="http://adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruit</a> integration. This meant I could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a> protocol to pass commands from Alexa to my circuit through Adafruit.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The MQTT protocol, in essence, is a publisher/subscriber model often used by IoT devices. In this use case, Alexa would publish different messages (turn on tv, turn on fan, clean up) and the circuit would subscribe to Alexa’s broadcast and trigger the correct IR signal.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Tutorial</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in replicating this same flow, start off by <a href="http://io.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">creating a free Adafruit account.</a></p>



<p>Once you’re logged in, go to Feeds and create a new Feed. In my case, I titled it <code>smartStudio</code>.  This Feed will be a running list of all messages sent to this topic over the MQTT protocol. As you can see, a log of all the voice commands I’ve used in the last month appear in this Feed.</p>

<p>Click on <code>This</code> and select Amazon Alexa. Then, select the Alexa “say a specific phrase” integration.</p>



<blockquote><p>You’ll be asked to complete a small authorization flow if this is the first time you’re integrating these services.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, whenever we say the phrase we define here, Alexa will trigger the “that” portion of your IFTTT integration.</p>

<p>Now, we can send a message to our Adafruit Feed with a custom payload, in this case <code>hbo</code>. All that’s remaining is to handle this case in the code and fire off the right IR signal.</p>



<p>Once you’ve created a few more triggers, your IFTTT dashboard should look something like this: </p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>Because the MQTT framework doesn’t guarantee delivery of a message, sometimes I would give Alexa a command, but the ESP8266 chip would never receive it. </p>



<p>It’s a fairly rare occurrence and since Adafruit doesn’t allow me to customize the quality of service settings for the MQTT implementation, there’s no immediate solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Some finishing touches</h2>



<p>Now, we’re on the home stretch. We’re able to issue a command to Alexa, which gets forwarded to IFTTT, then to Adafruit, and finally to my circuit which sends out the correct IR signal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final issue, however, was that even though saying “Alexa, trigger clean up” and having my robot vacuum cleaner spin up was pretty cool, I really disliked the sound of the robot bumping into everything as it cleaned. The noise is very noticeable in such a small apartment. </p>



<p>Eventually, I stumbled upon the “Routines” feature in the Amazon Alexa iOS app which allowed me to set up a few location-based triggers. </p>



<p>So, whenever I left my apartment, Alexa would trigger the “clean up” command. The robot would start up, and then 15 minutes later, Alexa would trigger the “dock” routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, my apartment would consistently stay clean and I wouldn’t have to hear the robot bumping around everywhere. Additionally,&nbsp; I added another routine that monitored my location to detect when I was heading back to my apartment and would preempt the cleaning with a “dock” command.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solving first world problems, I know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more useable experience, I’d also recommend enabling “follow up” mode (allows you to issue multiple commands at once) and “brief responses” on Alexa.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had this installed for a couple months, I wanted to see how often I actually used it. After pulling the logs from Adafruit, I’ve used this over 800 times in this month alone [August 2020], an average of almost 30 times a day.</p>

    <h2>Good Software Engineers Are Rare</h2>
<p>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mastering the skills is not enough to become a good engineer. If it were, the good software engineer would be no rarer than the hardworking, motivated engineer. Having the essential hard/technical skills mastered is only the start. To become great, the software engineer must adopt a mindset that often operates in opposition to the philosophical structure of the western world.</p>
<h2>Software Products Are Unique</h2>
<p>My development as an engineer began outside of the software world. I studied electrical engineering where I spent countless hours of my life in the lab: designing circuits, prototyping on breadboards, acid bathing PCBs. All of these efforts led to a finished, permanent product. Whether it be a power supply I could plug my computer into, a multimeter, an antenna, or some mostly useless gadget, I always had something I could hold in my hands that gave me a sense of pride and satisfaction. Productive societal activity tends to operate similarly. There is the expectation of tangible end results, and the success of an activity or task is contingent on the end result. For example, there are few companies or teams that do not set KRs (key results) each quarter, half, year. Developing software products, peskily enough, is decidedly unlike this. A software product is ephemeral. It can't be held or touched. There is no definitive "end result" or "finished product". What's more, the work done is impermanent. These traits aren't just unique, they clash with many fundamental expectations about the way we believe work/productive activity should behave. Whether consciously or subconsciously all good software engineers have had to internalize some sort of framework to allow themselves to reckon with this cognitive dissonance.</p>
<h2>Look To The East</h2>
<p>So what must a software engineer do if they can't rely on societal norms of the west to help them build the skills, temperance, and mindset to become competent, productive, and successful? They must <a href="https://www.theculturium.com/hermann-hesse-the-journey-to-the-east/">look to the east</a>. The western concepts that the software engineer must cast aside are:</p>
<pre><code> attachment
 permanence
 duality
 reason
</code></pre>

<p>The philosophy of Zen Buddhism rejects these cornerstones of western life. So it is in the delightful riddles/stories that the Zen Buddhists call <a href="http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html">Koans</a> that we might look for answers. The following are three of my favourite Koans that have been helpful on my path to becoming that rare and golden, madly productive, madly exact engineer.</p>
<h2>Non-Attachment</h2>
<pre><code>"Kitano Gempo, Abbot of Eihei temple, was ninety-two years old when he passed away in the year 1933. He endeavored his whole life not to be attached to anything. As a wandering mendicant when he was twenty he happened to meet a traveler who smoked tobacco. As they walked together down a mountain road, they stopped under a tree to rest. The traveler offered Kitano a smoke, which he accepted, as he was very hungry at the time.

"How pleasant this smoking is," he commented. The other gave him an extra pipe and tobacco and they parted.

Kitano felt: "Such pleasant things may disturb meditation. Before this goes too far, I will stop now." So he threw the smoking outfit away.

When he was twenty-three years old he studied I-King, the most profound doctrine of the universe. It was winter at the time and he needed some heavy clothes. He wrote his teacher, who lived a hundred miles away, telling him of his need, and gave the letter to a traveler to deliver. Almost the whole winter passed and neither answer nor clothes arrived. So Kitano resorted to the prescience of I-King, which also teaches the art of divination, to determine whether or not his letter had miscarried. He found that this had been the case. A letter afterward from his teacher made no mention of clothes.

"If I perform such accurate determinative work with I-King, I may neglect my meditation," felt Kitano. So he gave up this marvelous teaching and never resorted to its powers again.

When he was twenty-eight he studied Chinese calligraphy and poetry. He grew so skillful in these arts that his teacher praised him. Kitano mused: "If I don't stop now, I'll be a poet, not a Zen teacher." So he never wrote another poem. "
</code></pre>

<p>In this koan, Kitano displays an ability that every software engineer should find enviable: a relentless non-attachment to all things outside of the pursuit of Zen. A software project is in constant flux. So is the state of tools, technology, and frameworks in the field. There is a serious lack of permanence in software development, and the best way to cope with that impermanence is to become a solid practitioner of non-attachment.</p>
<p>The inability for ICs to remain unattached to particular pieces of work completed, or particular technologies is probably one of the most common and detrimental problems software development teams encounter. Features that have had blood, sweat, and tears poured into them but do not serve a purpose fail to get removed, technologies invested in that end up being duds do not get replaced. All of this results in projects and companies suffering major setbacks. Ben Horowitz frames the problem well in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Things about Hard Things</a>: "Early in my career as an engineer, I'd learned that all decisions were objective until the first line of code is written. After that, all decisions were emotional." The less attached a team of engineers is to their own work, the less emotional the decisions about a project will be. Good engineers are happy to delete their own code. A leaner code base is an easier codebase to work in. Good engineers are excited when a teammate finds a more robust, easier-to-work-with solution to the problem they have been working on. They don't create inertia and waste time by resisting switching to that solution, no matter how much work they have sunk into their own implementation. Good engineers are like Kitano.</p>
<h2>It Will Pass</h2>
<pre><code>A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling asleep. It's just horrible!"

"It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly.

A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!'

"It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.
</code></pre>

<p>Mmm, such a beautiful dialogue. Reading it quells the destructive flames of pride and ego that flare-up in my stomach whenever I am on a productive kick. Many engineers thrive off of the energy of this fire, but it can be dangerous if untempered. Engineers, it has been said, are natural optimists. Engineers are also, I will posit, naturally prideful. When they are assigned a project or ticket and are asked to estimate how long it will take, they almost certainly will imagine themselves at their most productive when making the estimate. This results in the unenlightened engineer wreaking no small havoc on the logistics of managing a project. No engineer is at their most productive at all times; the productive fervor of a great session is fickle. The engineers who assess their own skills and compare themselves to their colleagues as if they are, hurt themselves and their team. They stunt their growth (by believing they are already outperforming all their colleagues), are hard to manage, and are hard to work with.</p>
<p>Recently, while working on extending our application's backend to be accessible via a GraphQL API, I came across a few blogposts by an engineer named Marc-Andre Giroux. Clearly, a quite talented engineer, I noticed a neat little feature on his <a href="http://mgiroux.me/">site's homepage</a>. As a play on the 10x engineer motif, he describes himself as an "Nx platform interface engineer", the N flitting randomly between decimal numbers from 0 to 10. Marc-Andre is clearly a talented engineer, yet is zen enough to appreciate that he is not always in the state of ultra-productive. Admittedly, sometimes he is even less than 1x engineer. He understands "It will pass" and is most likely a factor in his success.</p>
<p>Avoiding overestimation of yourself is not the only lesson to be learned. This koan helps me to avoid taking productive times for granted. Understanding that quieter seas and lulls in productivity and focus may be just around the corner is good motivation to keep pushing for more while you are in the zone. Zen has taught me to never let a good session go to waste.</p>
<p>Finally, this koan helps me during the unproductive and unfocused times as well. I often experience a quite intense physical aching and pain during those hours where I can't seem to get any code written, or worse when I can only seem to produce poor, convoluted, messy solutions. Knowing that such a state is somewhat inevitable and that It Will Pass, is a medicative and constructive mindset to have.</p>
<h2>First There is a Mountain</h2>
<pre><code>At the first level on the path, he saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.

On the second level of the path, he saw that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers.

And at a third level, he saw once again mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.

<p>This koan is a description of the Zen student <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/#OveDua">overcoming dualism</a>. In Zen, the idea is called "Not Two". The student first sees the river as discrete from the mountains. The student then sees that …</p></div></div>

	<p>During my years as a software engineer, I got exposed to more and more
data-based projects where data engineering and model research were
major aspects of the system.</p>

<p>Over time, one main pattern became apparent: the functional programming
paradigm helps a lot when working with data-oriented systems.</p>

<p>For a regular data scientist or a data engineer, they will be quite familiar
with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. However, not all data scientists
and data engineers are familiar with functional programming and its
benefits.</p>



<p>I’ll remind again, that according to Uncle Bob, 
the essence of functional programming is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variables in functional languages do not vary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functional programming is disciple imposed upon variable assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements that change the state of the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you can assign variables a new value, but existing values cannot change.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'b'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>
<span># or 
</span><span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'c'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>

<span># GOOD
</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>my_var</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>)</span>

<span># or
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'new_value'</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>using functions</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>input_dict</span><span>[</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'var'</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>

<span># GOOD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>input_dict</span><span>,</span> <span>new_value</span><span>=</span><span>'var'</span><span>)</span>    

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has a few important implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you receive value, you can be sure that it won’t change mid-processing because it was modified
 in another thread</li>
  <li>as a function caller, you can be sure that after calling the function passed in arguments
 haven’t changed and you can use them the same way before calling the function</li>
  <li>as a function writer, you can do whatever you want with the data, as long as you do not change
 the original value and return results in the new one</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it reduces surprises and eases the cognitional context load of the programmer as
we do not  need to worry about the state of the entire program but just the 
local state (input)
of the function.</p>

<p>There is a common expectation that if you call the function with the same arguments, it will
return the same results. However, that is not always the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reading the same file, with the same filename, might produce a different result if the file was updated</li>
  <li>calling function that returns current time should return different time during each call</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>These edge cases usually creep in from the environment (boundaries with the environment) and a keen
functional practitioner could work around these by introducing Environment or Context
states but for practical purposes it is more work than it is worth.</p>

<p>The implications above often lead to code structure that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>)</span>
<span>b3</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>,</span> <span>x2</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easier to reason about the calls step-by-step as the context of each function call is
always limited.</p>

<p>As it usually happens, in data engineering data processing flows are often quite simple, and
the pipeline above looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>
<p>One missing, but quite important, piece of this puzzle is that the functions should be cohesive (
one responsibility) and loosely coupled. What does it mean to be loosely coupled?</p>

<p>Let’s compare these two examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What will happen, if <em>we</em> do not need to call <code>another_call</code>? In the first case, we could remove it
from the <code>third_call</code> function, but that would break functionality for all the other
users of <code>third_call</code> function.</p>

<p>Clearly, the latter case is more loosely coupled, because we can just drop the <code>x = another_call(x)</code>
line, we will achieve our goals, and the code won’t be broken for the other users.</p>

<p>The other nice thing is that nested function calls build this mental complexity hierarchy that
becomes harder to follow with each function. You can’t really understand what each function does
without traversing the hierarchy up and investigating all the other calls.</p>



<p>Now, we now know how to write nice “functional” functions. What can we do with that?</p>

<p>In the examples above we had a pipeline that processed just a single value. In most of the cases,
we operate on the lists. Those lists can be anything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lists of lists</li>
  <li>lists of byte arrays</li>
  <li>lists of tuples that are made of other objects and other lists</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>but we usually get some kind of list first. In Python, it means a specific type of array-like collection
but in reality, we just need some kind of Iterable.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-map">Enter the map</h2>

<p>When we are processing a list of items, it is extremely easy to use the functions that we’ve defined
above to process the list using a <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>On Python, the call would look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>my_function_one</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>another_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>third_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="reduce-it">Reduce it</h2>

<p>What if we want to get a single value as a result? Functional programming toolset has 
this function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">reduce</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>reduce</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually, <code>reduce(lambda c, i: c + i, x)</code> is the same as
<code>reduce(operators.add, x)</code>. It is also equivalent to <code>sum(x)</code> on Python,
so the same above could be expressed as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is important to note here, that <code>lambda c, i: c + i</code> is a function
and could be replaced with anything. For example, calculating is not
that difficult either (but there are better ways):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>accumulate</span><span>(</span><span>cumulative</span><span>,</span> <span>current_item</span><span>):</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>cumulative</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>+</span> <span>current_item</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>accumulate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>initial</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>average</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="composing-functions">Composing functions</h2>
<p>I’ve just used (introduced?) an extremely important concept in FP -  function composition. It deserves
a special mention.</p>

<p>In the part <code>reduce(accumulate, ...)</code> you can see that we are calling a function, that takes another
function as the argument. To be used inside <code>reduce</code> the <code>accumulate</code> function has to satisfy 
the same signature requirements (if such a thing exists in Python at all…) - it takes two arguments
and returns a single value. The first argument and the return value should be (preferably) of the same 
type.</p>

<p>Then, when the time comes, <code>reduce</code> will call our supplied function to accumulate the stream of values
into a single value (it will get <em>reduced</em>). 
For developers who know their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, 
it is the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>.</p>

<p>We can use the same idea in our functions as well. For example, let’s say we are writing a 
function to normalize some input data, but we want to let our users choose if the text
should be processed uppercased or lowercased. We could implement that like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>noop</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span> <span># default function that does nothing
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>first_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>)</span>
<span>second_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>)</span>
<span>third_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="factory-functions">Factory functions</h3>

<p>The version of the <code>clean_text</code> above can be unwieldy to use with <code>map</code> so it is often beneficial
to create a factory function, that creates the version of <code>clean_text</code> that has only a single
argument but you still get to choose which text processing function to use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is also a perfect way to create configurable functions.</p>

<h3 id="better-composition-examples">Better composition examples</h3>
<p>In the example above, we could move the text_processor to the pipeline itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so a better example would be a randomizing post-processing function, to augment 
text examples for your neural network. We will make this augment function configurable,
so the users of the function can choose the possible augmentations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>augment</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>augmentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>choice</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>augmentation</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>augment</span><span>([</span><span>noop</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>]),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Often, I get to see functions that look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>some_big_function</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>"a"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>z</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

            <span>i</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>counter</span>

<p>while the specific example above is not that bad because it is rather clear 
what’s happening just because it is ~10 lines long, I am not happy when I find
code like this.</p>

<p>This big function can be deconstructed in a few smaller functions (let’s pretend
that this code is 100 lines long) and those functions can then become a part
of the pipeline.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>is_empty</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>e</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span>

<span>def</span> <span>is_it_a</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>e</span> <span>==</span> <span>"a"</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598813964607/cahJGXdrf.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>That's a pretty daring question considering Rust has been around for a fairly short amount of time and in that time has become the most loved language for 5 years in a row, according to the Stack Overflow <a target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved">Developer Surveys</a>.</p>
<p>It is very clear that developers love working with Rust, many big companies have been adopting it to fix many of the memory issues C and C++ have caused by taking advantage of Rust's memory safety capabilities. Microsoft recently started rewriting <a target="_blank" href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/11/07/using-rust-in-windows/">core components</a> of Windows in Rust and the folks in charge of Linux have been talking about integrating Rust to the <a target="_blank" href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">kernel</a>. That's a big step for Rust.</p>
<p>But the question remains... should we trust Rust with the future of systems programming?</p>

<p>As much as it costs to admit, Rust is still a young language compared to C, which has been around for over 48 years and still is the preferred language for <strong>systems programming</strong>, every major operating system in the world is written in C/C++, as well as their drivers, utilities and built-in software.</p>
<p>But is Rust up to the challenge? Many developers have been rewriting software written in C with Rust, demonstrating that it is not only capable of competing with it but also of generating faster, more reliable software by taking advantage of Rust's modern features.</p>
<p>Here's a small <a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/">list</a> of projects to check out:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#bat">bat</a> -&gt; is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#exa">exa</a> -&gt;  is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#starship">starship</a> -&gt; is a minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/#ripgrep">ripgrep</a> -&gt; is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code></li>
</ol>

<p>While having programs rewritten in Rust is pretty cool, being able to write low-level components is a must-have for a language that intends to become #1 for systems programming, things such as the kernel and drivers. There are no immediate plans to rewrite current operating systems in Rust, but there is a project created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller">Jeremy Soller</a>, System76 Principal Engineer called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redox-os.org/">RedoxOS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redox aims to demonstrate Rust's systems programming capabilities to a full extent, having written not only the kernel in Rust but also every piece of software that it ships with it. One of those is <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc/-/blob/master/README.md">relibc</a>, a portable POSIX C standard library compatible with Redox and Linux. Redox isn't currently going to replace your existing OS, but it's a fun thing to try.</p>
<p>Rust still has a long way to go before it can compete with a language like C, but the future is looking very promising.</p>

<p>While Rust has come a long way but it still lacks many of the features that C/C++ programmers take for granted, just to name a few:</p>
<p><strong>Compile-time code/type generation and verification</strong> -&gt; Rust does have a procedural macro system that can be used to accomplish these things but it's not remotely the same.</p>
<p><strong>Static Analysis</strong> -&gt; There may be more tools available for C++ but the quality of the static analysis built right into Rust's type system blows all of them away, no tool can reliably prevent dangling references or data races in C++. As far as only using safe Rust, static analysis is in a way better shape than C++ because it has nothing as powerful as the borrow checker.</p>
<p><strong>Sanitizers</strong> -&gt; Due to the type system, safe Rust code has much less need for sanitizers, when it comes to unsafe code, C++ has the advantage as it has more tools available.</p>
<p>There's also safe transmutation (safely cast “plain old data” types to and from raw bytes), safe support for C style unions, and fallible allocation (fail gracefully from allocation failure, rather than panic) as stated by Microsoft.</p>

<p>As many missing features Rust has, its safe to say that, in time, Rust may become the language of choice for systems programming. Rust has an amazing community of developers that work hard every day to bring new features to the language, especially now that Microsoft supports Rust into becoming a better and more useful language. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We at Microsoft will be able to help in these endeavors to shape the future of the language to improve its usefulness [...]. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonmcintosh_facebooks-kenosha-guard-militia-event-was-activity-6705852062460084224-G5e9">posted the following note to my LinkedIn page</a> earlier today, where I also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/29/facebook-kenosha-guard-455-times">linked to this Daring Fireball article</a>.</em></p>

<p>A note to my friends who still work at Facebook:</p>

<p>You are at the top of your career. The very fact of your job at Facebook demonstrates a level of technical acumen that would allow you to work anywhere you wish within the technology sector.</p>

<p>The time has come for you to take advantage of this. Your employer has become unworthy of your talent. Please quit. Work for a company doing literally anything else.</p>

<p>From promoting hateful conspiracy theories to favoring Trump’s re-election, <a href="https://fogknife.com/2019-05-23-i-read-ruined-by-design.html">Facebook’s drive for emotionally fueled “engagement” over all else</a> steals the light from our shared human future in order to enrich a handful of people.</p>

<p>I know that you do not identify as a white supremacist. Facebook, however, funnels most of your talent directly into growing and empowering white supremacy’s most significant technological ally in spreading hate.</p>

<p>I urge you to think of your own career prospects, as well. The peak of Facebook’s positive reputation already lay in the past. After this year, employers will justifiably assume that hiring someone from Facebook would risk bringing in a culture of division, deception, and algorithmically optimized racism.</p>

<p>Please, for your own sake, if not for the sake of the future: leave Facebook. Do it today, before it ruins you.</p>

    <p>Saturday, 2pm. Kids are sleeping. Wife is sleeping. Had to stop preparing for the upcoming travel to make sure the rest of the family can rest in absolute silence. Looks the right time to take a break and sit down to write a piece. I have a short time and lot to say, so forgive me if the form is not perfect and let’s focus on content!</p>

<p>I recently heard the same question over and over: “<strong>How it working at Grafana Labs?</strong>”. My inner reaction is always the same: “<strong>Oh, I would have so much to say</strong>”, but I always lack the time to properly answer it and I limit my answer to a simple: “<strong>It’s amazing!</strong>”. But it’s more than that. There’s so much to say and in this article I would like to share a little bit of Grafana Labs from inside. Are you ready? Let’s go!</p>

<h2 id="lets-start-from-the-beginning">Let’s start from the beginning</h2>

<p>I joined Grafana 10 months ago, in October 2019. It was a difficult choice at that time. After 10 years, I was leaving a company I co-founded (<a href="https://spreaker.com/">Spreaker</a> which later became <a href="https://voxnest.com/">Voxnest</a>) to get back to an individual contributor role. I was excited to exit my comfort zone and do something new, but at the same time <strong>I was scared</strong>.</p>

<p>Many questions were running through my head: I know products are great, but how will people be? The company is growing fast, how much organizational chaos there will be? What if I don’t like it? What’s the stress level? And the work-life balance? Is people burning out? And so on. All legit questions. Whenever you change your job, either you’re leaving a terribly bad situation and you’ve nothing to loose (but was not my case) or stakes are high.</p>

<p>At the same time, I really wanted to exit my comfort zone, I really wanted Spreaker to not be my only significative working experience, and I wanted so badly that… I took my leap.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcement time!</p><p>I'm super excited to announce I will join <a href="https://twitter.com/grafana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@grafana</a> in less than two weeks! Can't wait to work on all things observability and the LGTM stack!</p><p>Stay tuned for more news! <a href="https://t.co/DM9W1mce1B">pic.twitter.com/DM9W1mce1B</a></p></div>— Marco Pracucci 🇮🇹🇪🇺 (@pracucci) <a href="https://twitter.com/pracucci/status/1178933608771440640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2019</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="the-leap">The leap</h2>

<p>I spent my first week in Stockholm where, coincidence, the bootcamp was happening. We were something around 50 people. It’s not something happening every month (and now, with an on-going pandemic, it’s a virtual event) and I felt super lucky to start my career at Grafana meeting people, sharing ideas, getting a feel of what’s being a Grafanista. A couple of days were structured in a conference-like fashion and has been one of the best “conferences” I ever attended.</p>

<p><strong>One day to forget my fears</strong>. Only one day. All my fears went away as soon as I’ve met the people. People is fantasic. Really. I know none will publicly say “my colleagues are dumbs” but, really, the quality level of people at Grafana is incredibly high.</p>

<p>At Grafana I found a concentrate of the <strong>smartest and kindest persons I’ve ever worked with</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-is-working-at-grafana-labs">So, how is working at Grafana Labs?</h2>

<p>If it’s true I have many things to mention when people asks me that question, this is the right time to share it! And this moves the conversation to <strong>what I love about working at Grafana</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-people">The people</h3>

<p>Yes, I’m cheating a bit because I already mentioned it. However, I wanna be cristal clear. People is fantastic. It’s not just that their smart and skilled, but it’s also <strong>a pleasure to work with</strong>.</p>

<p>The friction level is extremely low, nearly zero. It’s very unfrequent seeing people heating up. Even in stressful situations, people is calm, down to the earth and never pointing fingers.</p>

<p>My perspective is not a global view of the company. I daily closely interact with about 15 people, there are probably another 25-30 people with which I have unfrequent contacts, and then there’s the rest I’ve never met, excluding random chats on Slack or during calls.</p>

<p>Even if my view is not a global view, whatever I’m sharing has been confirmed every time I meet a new person in the company, so I have no reason to believe the “dark side of Grafana” to be completely different then what I’ve seen so far.</p>

<h3 id="fast-growing-company-controlled-chaos">Fast growing company, controlled chaos</h3>

<p>Grafana is growing <strong>fast</strong>. The company announced a <a href="https://grafana.com/about/press/2019-10-24-grafana-closes-series-a/">$24M Series A funding</a> in October 2019 and subsequent <a href="https://grafana.com/about/press/2020-08-17-series-b-announcement/">$50M Series B</a> a couple of weeks ago. When I joined, 10 months ago, we were about 110 headcounts. Today we’re 180+ and keep counting. I think it’s fair to call it a fast-growing company.</p>

<p>Whenever I think to a fast-growing company, I have an image in my mind: chaos. How can you grow a company unorganically, without introducing chaos? I don’t know, but didn’t happen. Chaos is under control, the company went through few re-orgs including a recent large one already <a href="https://gouthamve.dev/my-first-re-org/">covered very well by my colleague Goutham</a>.</p>

<p>Big shout out to how they managed the re-org: privately announcing to everyone during 1:1s before having an all-hands, being clear no layoffs were involved, the transparency while answering questions, are all important details that make you feel Grafana cares about people. A lot.</p>

<h3 id="the-culture">The culture</h3>

<p>Grafana has an incredibly <strong>open culture</strong>.</p>

<p>Since day zero you can access to a lot of business critical information and the level of trust is very high. There are obviously decisions taken behind closed doors (as it should be) and there are surely information not circulating to the whole company until the right time (as it should be), but some days I’ve the feeling I access to more critical information now than when I was a co-founder. Really.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long it will last. As the company will continue to grow it’s likely to be difficult to keep this level of transparency and openness (and if so, I will totally understand it), but so far the level of transparency is admirable.</p>

<h3 id="great-managers">Great managers</h3>

<p>I changed two managers so far, Tom and David. They’re both great. Managers can make an huge difference in the company. The most valuable 30 minutes slot of my week, is the 1:1 I’m having with my manager.</p>

<p>When I met David for the first time a couple of months ago, I asked him: “What should I expect from our 1:1?”. And he told me: “I don’t want to talk about projects”. And so we did.</p>

<p>The weekly 1:1 I’m having with my manager is <strong>focused on me</strong>. I’m receiving invaluable feedback during our 1:1s, from how to grow on my career path to how to structure a good tech talk. We talk and share ideas about productivity, mentoring, open-source, but everything we talk about is focused on me, how to improve and how to make Grafana a better place for me.</p>

<p>David now, and Tom before, showed me that great manager can make an huge difference in your career path ❤️.</p>

<h3 id="teams-and-squads-not-silos">Teams and squads, not silos</h3>

<p>But how is Grafana organized internally?</p>

<p>To keep it simple. We’re grouped into teams (I’m in the Cloud team), which are broad groups of people working on a specific business area, in my case the <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/">hosted solutions offering</a> like Hosted metrics or Hosted logs.</p>

<p>Each team can have multiple squads, which is a smaller group of people (5-10) working on a specific project, in my case <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> which is the system powering Hosted metrics. Each squad usually have a tech lead. Managers are usually assigned to people based on timezone, cross squad boundaries, but usually don’t cross team boundaries.</p>

<p>On a daily basis, we have an high interaction within the squad, a moderate iteraction within the team and a lower one with the rest of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Squads are not silos</strong>. We’re encouraged to interact with the rest of the company (and we do it) and I’ve never heard someone saying “oh, I don’t care, it’s not my job”.</p>

<p><strong>We all care about making the whole company successful</strong>, we do pair with sales and solutions engineers to on-board customers, we share feedback to areas outside the one of our competence, but it’s inevitable (and also desiderable) that we spend most of our time within the squad.</p>

<h3 id="no-micro-management">No micro management</h3>

<p>Oh, I love this thing. There’s no micro management at Grafana Labs.</p>

<p>None will tell you what you have to do on a daily basis. You’re expected to diligently organize yourself. I autonomously plan my week and my day, as I recently shared in the talk “<a href="https://pracucci.com/the-path-to-being-an-effective-engineer.html">The path to being an effective engineer</a>”.</p>

<p>So, how we align to the company goals? The management shares company-wide OKRs on a quarter basis. They’re very high level. Based on that, each team leader defines the team-level OKRs aligned with the company ones. And then, each individual contributor works, along with their manager, to define their own OKRs for the quarter.</p>

<p>Finally, execution time! We’re expected to organize ourself to execute our OKRs. None plans the month, week or day for you. We obviosuly frequently sync with the team, squad and manager, we raise flags if anything is going unexpected, we change our plans when priorities change, but we’re given an high degree of freedom and responsability at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="strong-opinions-loosely-held">Strong opinions, loosely held</h3>

<p>Yes, there’re strong opinions here. Stronger than what I was used before. And you know what? I like it.</p>

<p>People has strong opinions. You’re encouraged to have strong opinions, but loosely held. I’ve been involved in conversations during which people with strong opinions changed their mind in a heartbeat once new data points were brought to the table.</p>

<p>Whatever are your strong opinions, the goal is not to be right, but to take the right decision. And in case of stall, we disagree and commit. There’s nothing worth than a stall, in a decisional process. A suboptimal decision is better than no decision at all.</p>

<h2 id="oh-wow-so-all-rainbows-and-unicorns">Oh wow, so all rainbows and unicorns?</h2>

<p>Nah, it’s not all rainbows and unicorns. The perfect working place doesn’t even exist and, I believe, it’s not even desiderable. Some days are really enjoyable, others are tougher. Sometimes I end the day mentally exhausted, others the pager doesn’t stop ringing, but <strong>I don’t feel stressed</strong>. I’m hard working, but not burning out.</p>

<p>I start the day with a smile and I end the day with the same smile, whatever happened in between. And this, to me, is the best signal to know I’m in the right place, at the right time.</p>

		<p><em>So far I’ve only written about human systems and the unintended consequences that arise from them. But the “natural world” is complex also. We are just beginning to understand the interconnections of living and non-living things. Environmental ecosystems can also be pushed in one direction or another by human intervention and other activity. That means plenty of second-order effects.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Ecosystems are often complex beyond our ability to appreciate them, but on the surface they can seem simple. Maybe this is why there have been so many attempts to alter ecosystems by adding to them or subtracting from them. The impact of those additions or subtractions can tough to know in advance, but the impact can be estimated and controlled. Beyond intentionally changing an ecosystem, there are also all of the non-human changes that occur.</p>
<p><span id="more-344"></span>There’s a blurry line between invasive or introduced species and native or indigenous species. To be counted as invasive or introduced, there needs to be human intervention — a distinction without a difference if the result ends up the same. Species move around the world on their own all the time (wind, sea, on or in the bodies of their hosts). Then there are gray areas, such as species that navigate to new environments by floating on plastic in the ocean. They can hitch a ride on floating material that is only there because of human activity, but it wasn’t humans who brought the species to any specific place.</p>

<p>While it might seem odd today to intentionally introduce and spread species from other parts of the world, <strong>in the 1800s, this interventionist&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/stream/cihm_22920#page/n7/mode/2up">attitude</a> was <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1877/11/15/80669466.pdf">common</a>&nbsp;in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatisation_society">acclimatization societies</a></strong>.</p>
<p>From a “<a href="https://archive.org/stream/acclimatisation00unkngoog#page/n8/mode/2up">Lecture on Acclimatisation</a>” in Australia: The societies were about “the acclimatisation or art of introducing the mammalia, birds, fishes, and insects into countries to which they are foreign, utilising them in places where they were formerly unknown, and in such congenial localities as may conduce to their being reared and propagated with success — thus reducing our scientific knowledge to useful and practical purposes.”</p>
<p>Two factors encouraged this work. First there were food shocks felt around the world, including for example the effects of the potato blight in Ireland. One ideas supporting species introduction was to lower the risk of dependence on only local foods.</p>
<p>The other factor encouraged — or at least that didn’t stop — these societies is the lack of understanding of the risks they were creating.&nbsp;It was apparently rare in these societies to debate the impact species introduction might have on local ecosystems and how to introduce species in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>Here are ways that ecosystems change by the addition or subtraction of just one species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Intentional introduction for food.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Rabbits in Australia.&nbsp;</em>Feral pigs in the Americas.</p>
<p>Introduced as a food source in the 1800s, rabbits have caused ecological damage by multiplying so quickly that the food they ate depleted plant life and led to soil erosion.&nbsp;Rabbits in Australia are an example of just how fast things can change when a small number of fast reproducing, fast-moving, versatile animals are introduced into a suitable environment.</p>
<p>Rabbits can bread only in Spring and Summer in Europe, but year round in much of Australia. They were a good candidate to cause environmental&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/anything-at-scale/">scaling effects</a>&nbsp;in Australia. And they did. Rabbits are the fastest reproducing mammal in the world.</p>
<p>Multiple efforts to eradicate or control them, from germ warfare to a fence spanning the western part of Australia, have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Pigs were introduced into the Americas multiple <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rh0LmDWdEI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wild+Pigs+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VOF2Uc-sBsXH4APJwoGgAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">times</a>. First by Columbus, who brought eight pigs on his voyage to Cuba in 1493. Then by Hernando de Soto who brought 13 pigs to Florida in 1539. Apparently, by 1542 that pig herd grew to 700, not including those that escaped. Hernando Cortez brought pigs to New Mexico in 1600. Sir Walter Raleigh brought pigs to Jamestown in 1607. Pigs were even introduced from Europe as late as the 1930s. In some <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-cobra-effect-redesigned/">locations</a>, the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-cobra-effect-redesigned/">wild pigs</a> are a nuisance with repeated attempts to eradicate or control their populations. So far, control has not worked. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069/">Feral pig</a> populations can <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/operational-activities/feral-swine/sa-fs-history">expand quickly</a>, even with efforts at control. Generalist eaters suited for many different environments and too big for most predators, they are mostly considered a nuisance today.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intentional introduction to combat another species. </em></strong><em>Cane toads in Australia.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/c/cane-toad/">Cane toads</a> are native to Latin America but were introduced to Australia to combat a beetle that ate sugar cane roots. The Australian sugar cane plantations were themselves a new experiment. And the cane toads never did eat many of those beetles.</p>
<p>Native species in Australia, “unaware” that cane toads are also poisonous, die <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_monitor">trying</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_quoll">eat</a> them. Predators seem to be learning though. Some birds learned to attack the toads’ underbelly and avoid the poison glands on its back, while some snakes with <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/49/17150">smaller jaws</a> (which don’t enable them to eat the large cane toad) succeeded in reproducing and passing on that trait.</p>
<p>Efforts at cane toad control include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canetoadsinoz.com/">training</a> potential predators like water monitors, quolls, and bluetongue lizards to avoid the cane toads by administering manageable amounts of toad, which convinces the would-be predators to stay away.</p>
<p>There was <a href="https://theconversation.com/everyone-agreed-cane-toads-would-be-a-winner-for-australia-19881">broad approval</a> in the 1930s of the plan to introduce this species to Australia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intentional introduction as art.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Starlings in the US.</em></p>
<p>It’s not every day that we can blame the Bard of Avon and his fans for an unintended consequence. But Eugene Schieffelin “hoped to introduce into North America <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/01/opinion/100-years-of-the-starling.html?src=pm">every bird</a> mentioned by Shakespeare.” He imported starlings from England and released them in Manhattan in 1890 and 1891. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/01/opinion/100-years-of-the-starling.html?src=pm">Starlings</a> soon started to drive native birds out of their habitats, ate massive amounts of crops, and spread disease. By the 1940s, starlings had reached California. They now number in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering, Shakespeare only mentioned starlings in&nbsp;Henry IV Part I. A list of all the other birds is <a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/faq/birdsshakespeare.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Accidental introduction.</strong>&nbsp;The brown tree snake in Guam and other islands in the South Pacific.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_tree_snake">brown tree snake</a>, native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia, was accidentally introduced into Guam. The theories are that the snakes hitched a ride on ships or aircraft landing gear after WWII. Guam was an easy location for the snakes to colonize quickly since the island didn’t have natural predators for them. What followed was the local or total extinction of many bird species, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam_flycatcher">Guam Flycatcher</a>.</p>
<p>Guam, as a transportation hub, became the staging ground for the brown tree snake’s entrance to many other environments which suited it. The attempt to kill off the brown tree snake population starting in <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2010/10/navy-airdrops-dead-drugged-mice/">2010</a> (60 years after its introduction) was to drop mice stuffed with Tylenol (poisonous to the snakes) in trees where the snakes would eat them. This kill technique’s&nbsp;design seems well targeted at brown tree snakes (well, we’ll see). As one of the few snakes that will also scavenge for food (and will therefore eat the poisoned dead mice), the program has a chance. I can’t find much detail related to how well the program has reduced the brown tree snake population. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intentional reintroduction of “native species” that went extinct.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Beavers in UK.</em></p>
<p>Beavers went extinct in UK in the 1600s. A few years ago they were <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286869238_Reintroducing_the_European_Beaver_in_Britain">reintroduced</a> into Scotland and England for reasons including flood control and beavers’ encouragement of greater species diversity in places they inhabit.&nbsp;When beavers were reintroduced, people revolted. But&nbsp;these releases have apparently been controlled and studied in the small scale and it looks like the reintroduction has (so far) been beneficial. Again, we’ll see.</p>
<p><span>The estimate is that there are </span><a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=nwrcinvasive">50,000 introduced species</a><span> in the US (out of 750,000 species present here).&nbsp;The examples above are just a handful of the more noticeable ones. </span></p>

<p>Years ago someone told me a story about a big media company. They had to rip up part of the floor in one of their offices to make repairs and discovered a tangled mass of communications cables snaking underneath. What did they do? Replace and reconnect the cables? No. When they saw that tangled mass, they touched nothing down there and carefully replaced the floorboards. Who knows where each cable led and what content it carried? Better just to leave things as they were.</p>
<p>In a complicated system, unless you understand how your change make things better, better just to leave things as is.</p>
<p>And if you want to read about a system falling apart in something as predictable as a pocket watch, see <a href="http://www.pocketwatchrepair.com/histories/twain2.html">Mark Twain</a>.</p>

          <div>
            <p><span>Automated Product Research</span></p><p>AMZ Snagger was birthed from the perspective of an amazon dropshipper. After months of grinding it out, putting in 100hr weeks looking for winning products and being able to scale into a 6 figure store. We knew that product research was an issue and it needed to be simplified.</p>
            <p>No one believed it could be done but we always did. So we got to work and designed YOU a bot from the mind of an amazon dropshipper.</p>
            <p>We designed a proprietary algorithm that mines, scrapes, sorts and filters winning products for you on autopilot. So that you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.</p>
            <p>Now we want you to experience what we experienced: The redemption of our time!</p>

          <div>
            <p><span>Sort Through Qualified Products</span></p><p>We designed the app to filter and weed out the diamonds in the rough. This has virtually never been done before, since we ourselves our dropshippers we knew exactly What the amazon dropshipping community wanted to experience.</p>
            <p> Sorting Options like: price, category, sellers on listings, buyBox Eligibility and the potential for profit</p>
            <p>The most exciting part of this all, is that you are able to download all of the Winning products that are profitable and export them as a CSV.</p>

The approach known as <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fajp.psychiatryonline.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2020.19080886&amp;t=MDNhODhkMjRjMWEwMWRkMDY1NWJhMjJmYjQ3OTZmY2M2OWZhNjRiZixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">‘exposure therapy’, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, was more effective and reduced symptoms more as time went on, compared with stress-management therapy</a>, also known as SMT.</p><p>But when the researchers looked back at the brain scans taken before the patients began therapy, and linked them to individual treatment response, they found striking patterns.</p><p>The brain scans were taken while patients performed a simple cognitive task and responded to a small monetary reward if they did the task correctly.</p><p>Those who started out with more activation in brain circuits for processing cognitive demands and reward during the tests were more likely to respond to CBT – but those who started out with less activation in those same areas during the same tests were more likely to respond well to SMT.</p><p>“We found that the more OCD-specific form of therapy, the one based on exposure to the focus of obsession and compulsion, was better for relieving symptoms, which in itself is a valuable finding from this head-to-head randomized comparison of two treatment options,” says <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.umich.edu%2Fdept%2Fpsychiatry%2Fstephan-taylor-md&amp;t=NTU2MzA1YjgyMDQzZjIwY2VhMzc0Yjg3NzRjNzMzNzQ0Njk4ZGZkZixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">Stephan Taylor, M.D.</a>, the study’s senior author and a professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine, U-M’s academic medical center. “But when we looked at the brain to see what was behind that response, we found that the more strength patients had in certain brain areas were linked to a greater chance of responding to exposure-based CBT.”</p><h2><b>Key brain regions involved in studying OCD</b></h2><p>The brain regions and circuits that had the strongest links to treatment have already been identified as important to OCD – and have even been targets for treatment with an emerging therapy called transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p><p>Specifically, stronger activity in the circuit called the cinguloopercular network during the cognitive task, and stronger activity in the orbitostriato-thalamic network when the reward was at stake, was associated with better response to exposure-based CBT. But lower activity in both regions was associated with better response to the stress-reduction SMT. The effects didn’t vary across age groups.</p><p>“These findings speak to a mechanism for therapy’s effects, because the brain regions associated with those effects overlap substantially with those implicated previously in this disorder,” says Luke Norman, Ph.D., who led the work as a U-M neuroscience postdoctoral fellow and is now a scientist at the National Institutes of Health. “This suggests we need to draw upon the most-affected networks during therapy itself, but further research is needed to confirm.”</p><p>The brain scans were done while patients underwent a test that required them to correctly pick the correct letter out of a display, and offered a potential monetary reward if they performed the task correctly. This measured both their ability to exert control over their cognitive processes in picking out the right letter, and the extent to which the promise of a reward motivated them.</p><figure data-orig-width="850" data-orig-height="478"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f606c03e13777957afd9b7ca52f1da45/ce424dd158826732-61/s1280x1920/c861a16fef139b4cd7b17f72683ee3a830e74f38.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="850" data-orig-height="478" width="850" height="478"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The colorful brain regions show where differences in activation were associated with differences in OCD treatment response.

Past research has already linked it to OCD and treatment response in general, and it’s thought to play a key role in self-regulation of response to OCD triggers. Previously, the U-M team had shown that in general, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flabblog.uofmhealth.org%2Flab-report%2Fstuck-a-loop-of-wrongness-brain-study-shows-roots-of-ocd&amp;t=MTU1MTA4ZDhhNjI0OWFlMmE3OTFjOWNhNzdlNGUxNjRlZjcxMTg3NixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">people with OCD tend to have reduced activation in the rACC</a> when asked to perform tasks that involve cognitive control.</p><p>Among those who responded best to CBT, the researchers saw stronger pre-treatment activation in areas of the brain associated with learning how to extinguish fear-based responses to something that has caused fear in the past. Because exposure therapy for OCD involves facing the thing or situation that provokes obsessive and fearful responses, having a stronger ability to be motivated by rewards might help someone stick with therapy despite having to face their triggers.</p><h2><b>Personalizing OCD treatment</b></h2><p>The findings suggest a path to personalizing the choice of therapy not by doing brain scans on everyone with OCD – which would be impractical – but by using everyday tests that measure the kinds of characteristics that might predict better success with one therapy or the other.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uofmhealth.org%2Fprofile%2F576%2Fkate-dimond-fitzgerald-md&amp;t=ODZmYmRjMWY1ZjNkMzkzZTAzZWUxNjBhNDM1Yjc1MzY2ZDEyNTI0ZixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">Kate Fitzgerald, M.D.</a>, a pediatric OCD specialist at Michigan Medicine who is co-senior author of the paper and leads multiple studies of OCD therapy for children and adolescents, explains that easily administered behavioral tests could be developed to help therapists recommend CBT to those who have the most cognitive control and reward responsiveness, and SMT to those who would benefit most from being taught to relax and use problem-solving techniques to improve their response to stressors.</p><p>But computer-based brain-training exercises that can strengthen these tendencies, and rewards for exposing oneself to the thing or action that triggers OCD symptoms, may hold the potential to improve therapy response, she says.</p><p>“This kind of research may help inform efforts to do cognitive control training and ramp up the circuits that help patients overcome conflict between obsessive fears and insight that these fears don’t make sense so that patients can dismiss the fear as improbable, rather than trying to make it go away with compulsive behaviors,” she says. “Our research shows that different brains respond to different treatments, and if we can build on this knowledge we could move toward a more precision-medicine approach for OCD.”</p><p>In children and teens, whose brains are still maturing, there’s an especially good chance of helping them improve their brains’ control functions.</p><h2><b>New research to advance OCD understanding</b></h2><p>Fitzgerald and her team are currently recruiting <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT03584945%3Frecrs%3Dab%26cond%3Dobsessive%2Bcompulsive%2Bdisorder%26age%3D0%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D7&amp;t=YzE4YjBmZDI1OGQ0MDE3ZTAwMWZmYTdmNjlhMTVlMTk4YmI3NDQyOSxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">young people with diagnosed OCD, and OCD-like tendencies, for a clinical trial that provides CBT</a> and includes brain scanning before and after therapy.</p><p>Since OCD symptoms typically start in the tween years, though diagnosis may not occur until the teen or young adult years, it’s important to study children with sub-clinical symptoms, she notes.</p><p>Though the study involves in-person interactions for the brain scans, the CBT exposure therapy is done through video chat. In fact, Fitzgerald says, this can make it easier for children and teens to confront the item or situation that triggers their OCD-like impulses, because these are often found in the home environment.</p><p>“We need families and patients to engage with researchers in studies like these,” says Fitzgerald. “Only through research can we understand what works best for different groups of patients. And perhaps by doing so we can expand the availability of the most evidence-based OCD therapies – including by engaging psychologists and clinical social workers in leading treatment programs, in addition to psychiatrists at specialized centers.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flabblog.uofmhealth.org%2Fbody-work%2Fwhich-ocd-treatment-works-best-new-brain-study-could-lead-to-more-personalized-choices&amp;t=ZjQ5ZTZiMjg4ODMzZGZmNjlkYzFjMDdkNzBmOTY4MzBmMjg5NmYzNixnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">University of Michigan</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Treatment-Specific Associations Between Brain Activation and Symptom Reduction in OCD Following CBT: A Randomized fMRI Trial”,&nbsp;<i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2020.19080886&amp;t=ZmQ2Y2QzYjJhZTAxY2NkNWFiOGI5NjliNjhkZDliNDhlNWIyMTA1YSxnOWo3RE1BWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627900402450497536%2Fpersonalized-ocd-treatment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599063882">https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19080886</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/180354004837/smartphone-app-for-ocd">Simple smartphone app that could help OCD sufferers</a></p>

August 30, 2020 | https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><em>This is part 1 of a series by the data visualization tool <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a> that explains log scales. Visit <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">part 2</a> or <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale3/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<p>As promised <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-scatterplotlinechart">last week</a>, we have a closer look at the logarithmic scale this week. I won’t get into mathematical details to explain what a logarithm is – I won’t even explain when we should use log scales instead of linear scales. This and next week, I’ll explain what log scales can tell us.</p>
<p>We start slowly. Here’s a chart that’s not on a log scale –&nbsp;not yet:</p>
<hr>

<p>We will transform it to a chart with a log scale in a minute (in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a>, it’s as easy as clicking on a checkbox). First, let’s learn some basics about log scales, to understand what they tell us:</p>
<h3 id="Log-scales-show-relative-values">Log scales show relative values</h3>
<p><strong>Log scales show relative values instead of absolute ones.</strong> Log scales don’t care that 101 minus 100 equals the same as 2 minus 1. Instead, they are concerned with percentages: the difference between 100 and 101 is a 1% increase, while the difference between 1 and 2 is a 100% increase. So on a log scale, the distance between 100 and 101 is roughly 1% of the distance between 1 and 2:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log6.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log6.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log6.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-same-distance-on-a-log-scale-shows-the-same-rate">The same distance on a log scale shows the same rate</h3>
<p>So what do same distances on a log scale show? They show the same percentage growth or decline. Imagine you eat candy for money and your business grows yearly by 100%. That means every year you eat twice as many candies than you ate the previous year.</p>
<p>In year zero, you start by eating <strong>1</strong> candy.</p>
<p>In the 1st year, you eat <strong>2</strong> candies. The year after that, you eat <strong>4</strong> candies. In the 3rd year, you eat <strong>8</strong> candies. By year 5, you eat <strong>32</strong> candies, and on your 25th anniversary, you would be eating <strong>33.5 million</strong> candies.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, a line chart plotting these numbers would go insanely high very quickly. On a log scale, each of these amounts takes up the same space, because, in each year, the number of candies <strong>grows at a fixed rate (100%)</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log1.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log1.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log1.png"></p>
<h3 id="How-to-read-a-log-scaled-chart">How to read a log scaled chart</h3>
<p>Let’s see what that means for our chart. Here, the log scale can show us two things that the linear scale can’t show us: First, the <strong>drop of short-term arrivals in the Second World War</strong>. There wasn’t a stark drop in <em>absolute</em> numbers (that’s why we can’t see it in the chart up there), but it was a stark drop in <em>relative</em> numbers:</p>

<p><strong>How stark?</strong> Well, we know by now that the same unit on a log scale represents the same growth rate. Looking closer, we see that the drop during the Second World War is almost as “deep” as the growth afterward is “high”. In April 1942, only 40 people visited New Zealand. Three years earlier, there were 33 times as many tourists: 1,310 in total. It took ten years to get back to that number of 1,300 tourists (for April) – that’s the brown range in our chart. But the growth didn’t stop there. Within 32 years, the number of tourists in New Zealand grew again by 33 times and reached 45,700 tourists in 1984 – that’s the blue range.</p>
<p>The <strong>blue range has the same height as the brown range because both ranges represent a 33-fold increase</strong>; no matter their absolute values. So during the Second World War, the arrivals in New Zealand dropped almost by the same rate between 1939 and 1942 as they increased between 1952 and 1984. That’s something the log scale can tell us and the linear scale can’t.</p>
<p>The log scale also shows us something about the arrivals each season. We can see that the ups and downs get smaller over time. So we can conclude that <strong>seasonal increase and decrease of arrivals each year happened at a higher rate</strong> before the Second World War than after the Second World War, and at an even lower rate since approximately 1985.</p>

<p><em>Next week, we’ll explore magnitudes, and how log scales are ideal to show exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">Visit the article here.</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is the most comprehensive guide to Captive Portal on the planet.</p><p>I’m going to show you how you can build your own Captive Portal Software for Hacking, Business Security, and Growth.</p><p>In short: if you want to leverage WiFi Captive Portals for improving your Business, you’ll love this guide.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p><note>Sharpen your Network Security skills with <b>rootsh3ll Labs</b>, right from your browser. Click to <a href="https://labs.rootsh3ll.com/?ref=" captive-portal-guide"="">start you first lab</a></note></p><p>Operating in an Enterprise, studying in a college or sitting in Starbucks, you must have encountered a login screen like this once.</p><p>You connect to the WiFi network and it greets with you a similar login screen. That page is called a captive portal.</p><p>But, what is a captive portal exactly, How does it work and how the system knows where the captive portal is?</p><p>These are all the questions you are going to uncover from this guide and take-away the knowledge to build your own captive portal for your company, institute etc and use it for fun and profit.</p><p>Technically speaking, an authentication screen is displayed when a wireless user is not authorized to access the network resources. The authentication page is called a captive portal login.</p><p>1. DNS Redirection<br>
2. Splash page</p><p>DNS redirection works as the simple DNS hijacking where all the user DNS requests are hijacked and resolved to the captive portal login page. But, after widespread use of HSTS header implementation, DNS redirection hits a low success ratio providing no better service to the users.</p><p>Whereas, a Splash Page works in a little different fashion. It also uses DNS redirections but, it responds to the requests acc. to the operating systems which trick the O.S in believing there is a captive portal login in place and forcing the O.S to automatically trigger the login page to the user.</p><p>When a client device is connected to the WiFi, If unauthorized to access the Internet, A screen automatically pops up to display the captive portal.</p><p>A Splash page not only bypasses HSTS implementations on most websites but also gives you the flexibility of showing O.S specific login pages.</p><div>

<p>The only difference in regular captive portal and splash page is that splash page pulls up the captive portal login page automatically. Whereas, the DNS redirection based method requires a user to manually open up a website.</p>
<p>Imagine if a user is using a mobile app only, how would a user know he needs to log in? If you are a hacker you will lose your victim because the device will automatically disconnect upon no Internet access. So, this leads us to the much better and flexible option for triggering captive portal login page, the Splash Screen.</p>
<p>As a business operator, you can show a different kind of services to different client devices, whereas as an attacker you can identify victim machine automatically and serve the payload accordingly. I’ll showcase its crux, and leave implementation upon your creativity and requirement.</p>

<h2>Different Client Behaviours</h2>
<p>Now comes the technical theory part of this guide. It is important for you to understand the theory behind a captive portal before diving into the practical aspect of it.<br>
<a href="#start-ap">Click here</a> to skip the theory and jump into action</p>
<h3>Basic Strategy behind portal detection</h3>
<p>Every operating system has its own different way of detecting Internet access.</p>
<p>The mechanism is this basically:</p>
<pre>GET/POST http://foo.com/bar.html
If bar.html == [expected content] &gt; Open Internet
If bar.html != [expected content] &gt; Captive Portal
If bar.html[status] != SUCCESS &gt; No Network
</pre>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A%20Practical%20step-by-step%20Guide%20to%20Captive%20Portals%20%23WiFiHacking&amp;url=https://rootsh3ll.com/captive-portal-guide&amp;via=rootsh3ll&amp;original_referer=https://rootsh3ll.com/captive-portal-guide%20%26via%3Drootsh3ll" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span>Tweet this Captive Portal Guide</span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></a></p>
<p>If a Captive Portal is not in place, the result will match the expected one and the OS will know that there is full access to the Internet.</p>
<p>If the URL returns a result other than the expected one, then the OS will detect that there is a Captive Portal in place and that it’s needed to proceed with authentication in order to get full access to the Internet: In this case, the OS will open the Splash Page automatically.</p>
<p>All client devices use the above-described strategy to find out if they are behind a captive portal, but the URL might vary depending on the specific model of smartphone, tablet, laptop and depending on the specific OS version. In the following, you can find the list of domains that are contacted by each model in order to detect the captive portal.</p>
<h3>Captive Portal Detection method by various Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>Android 4 – 9</h4>
<p>Android devices look for an HTTP 204 response for a file named generate_204 from the following domain.</p>
<pre><code>clients3.google.com
connectivitycheck.android.com
connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code></pre>
<p>HTTP Status 204 means the file exists but, is empty. This lets Android know that the Internet is accessible. If the request receives HTTP Status 302 (temporary redirect) instead of HTTP 204, Android will follow the redirection URL to display the Captive Portal to the user.</p>
<p>In its nature, all the domains serve on HTTP and not HTTPS which makes the captive portal mechanism possible. Also, it allows an attacker to use the redirection to bypass security.</p>
<p>Unlike Apple Devices, Android is very fragmented acc. to the install base. Which leaves us with a wide variety of attack surface as an attacker. Have a look at the current install base of Android devices acc. to Google.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<h2>Apple’s secret “WISPr” request</h2>
<p>WISPr (pronounced “whisper”) or Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming used by every Apple device for captive portal detection. This technology allows users to roam between wireless internet service providers in a fashion similar to that which allows cell phone users to roam between carriers.</p>
<p>Another question is whether this is an attack vector. The answer is “probably yes”. There is more to the functionality than a simple HTTP request. If you look up the keyword “wispr” from the User-Agent string in apache logs, you’ll find out why.</p>
<p>The idea is that smart Wi-Fi portals will detect that this is a WISPr-supporting device, and send back a WISPr message in XML. This allows the iDevice(s) to then log in with cached credentials via another XML message. This means, for example, you might be able to grab somebody’s credentials with a properly configured Wi-Fi access-point.</p>
<p>When an iDevice connects to a Wi-Fi network, the first thing it does is make a request to the URL captive.apple.com or apple.com/test/success.html.</p>
<p>With iOS 7 onwards, Apple began to use the User Agent “<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport</strong>“, though it’s not as common as the URL method that Android and Windows uses.</p>
<p>The reason Apple does this is that you may be using an app other than the web browser. For example, the only thing you might be doing is syncing your e-mail. In such situations, no auto-redirection would work as no browser is in use and you would never see the portal page, and your app will mysteriously fail to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Therefore, before your app has a chance to access the network, Apple does this for you. It sends out a request to the above URL. If the request gets redirected, then Apple knows there is a portal. It then launches a dialog box, containing Safari, to give you a chance to log in.</p>
<p>When reading apache logs (<b>/var/logs/apache2/access.log</b>) for apple devices, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre>10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET /hotspot-detect.html HTTP/1.0" 302 487 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"
10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2004 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="start-ap">Access Point Configuration</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo apt update</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq apache2 -y</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<h4>Configure hostapd</h4>
<p>Create a directory for saved configuration files. Open Terminal and create a hostapd config file.</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi hostapd.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>hostapd.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>       # Desired Interface name
driver=nl80211
ssid=<span>Captive Portal</span>   # Desired AP name
hw_mode=g
channel=<span>6</span>
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
</pre>
<p>Make sure you edit the changes accordingly every time you perform an attack.</p>
<p>Operating Channel number can cause issues if not chosen properly.</p>
<h4>Configure dnsmasq</h4>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi dnsmasq.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>dnsmasq.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>   # Desired Interface name
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,255.255.255.0,12h
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1
server=8.8.8.8
log-queries
listen-address=127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Make sure to define proper interface in dnsmasq.conf file.</p>
<h4>Parameter Breakdown:</h4>
<pre><strong>dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,12h</strong>:  Client IP address will range from 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.250 and default lease time is 12 hours.
<strong>dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1</strong>:  3 is code for Default Gateway followed by IP of D.G i.e. 10.0.0.1
<strong>dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1</strong>:  6 for DNS Server followed by IP address</pre>
<p>Kill network-manager utility before running hostapd. Because when you start hostapd, network-manager tries to take control of the wireless device and put it into managed mode. whereas hostapd needs the card to be set to Master mode (Access Point mode). So, kill network-manager and other interfering processes before you begin</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo killall network-manager wpa_supplicant dnsmasq</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo hostapd hostapd.conf</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<p>To allocate IP addresses to victims, run dnsmasq.<br>
Before that, set IP address for wlan0 interface to enable IP networking, so that dnsmasq can process the incoming requests and direct the traffic accordingly.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal for dnsmasq:</p>
<pre>ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1       # Set class-A IP address to wlan0
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d    # -C: configuration file. -d: daemon (as a process) mode
</pre>
<p>as soon as victim connects you should see similar output for hostapd and dnsmasq Terminal windows:</p>
<p><file>[ <strong>hostapd</strong> ]</file></p>
<pre>Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 00:c0:ca:5a:34:b7 and ssid "rootsh3ll"
wlan0: interface state …</pre></div></div>

This is wonderful news for us to test this functionality in our labs, or in case we are using Linux storage with MinIO for production.</p><p>In this blog entry, we’re going to jump into the pool and see: how to install and configure MinIO with Erasure Coding Enabled, Immutability, Let’s Encrypt, and finally, we’ll see how to configure it in Veeam. As it has gone out of my hands, I leave you with a menu to move faster:</p><ol><li><a href="#requerimientos"><strong>MinIO System Requirements</strong></a><ol><li><a href="#que"><strong>What is MinIO Erasure Coding?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#util"><strong>Why use MinIO Erasure Coding?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#configuracion"><strong>Disk Configuration to use MinIO Erasure Coding</strong></a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#desplegar"><strong>How-to Deploy, and Configure MinIO, including object Immutability, and Let’s Encrypt</strong></a><ol><li><a href="#confminio"><strong>How-to configure&nbsp; Let’s Encrypt for MinIO</strong></a></li><li><a href="#arrancar"><strong>Run MinIO with Erasure Coding</strong></a></li><li><a href="#crear"><strong>Creating a new Bucket in MinIO with the Immutability attribute</strong></a></li></ol></li><li><strong><a href="#veeam">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication Configuration with Immutable Storage</a> </strong><ol><li><a href="#repo"><strong>Backup Repository Creation – Object Storage</strong></a></li><li><a href="#sobr"><strong>Scale-out Backup Repository Creation – with MinIO Immutable as Capacity Tier</strong></a></li><li><a href="#backupcopy"><strong>Backup Copy Job creation, pointing to this new SOBR with Immutability</strong></a></li><li><a href="#eliminar"><strong>Trying to delete Backups from an Object Storage with Immutability Enabled</strong></a></li></ol></li></ol><h2><a name="requerimientos"></a> MinIO System Requirements</h2><p>In this guide, we are not going to try to deploy MinIO in production, as it usually requires about 96GB of RAM, certain cores, etc. In my case I am deploying everything in 4vCPU and 16GB of RAM since I will have only one VBR sending backups, so nothing serious.</p><p>One of the most important things to be able to run Immutability in MinIO, and that it is supported by Veeam, is that we need the MinIO RELEASE.2020-07-12T19-14-17Z version or higher, and also we need the MinIO server to be running with Erasure Coding.</p><h3><a name="que"></a>What is MinIO Erasure Coding?</h3><p>MinIO Erasure Coding is a mathematical algorithm to reconstruct lost or corrupted data. MinIO uses Reed-Solomon code to fragment objects into variable data and parity blocks. For example, in a 12-unit configuration, an object can be split into a variable number of data and parity blocks in all units – from six data and six parity blocks to ten data and two parity blocks.</p><p>By default, MinIO divides objects into N/2 data and parity units. However, you can use storage classes to use a custom configuration. We recommend the N/2 data and parity blocks, as this ensures the best protection against drive failure.</p><p>In the 12-drive example above, with the MinIO server running at the default settings, you can lose any of the six drives and still reliably rebuild data from the remaining drives.</p><h3><a name="util"></a>Why use MinIO Erasure Coding?</h3><p>MinIO Erasure Coding protects data from multiple drive failures, unlike RAID or replication. For example, RAID6 can protect against the failure of two drives, while MinIO Erasure Coding can lose up to half of the drives and still keep the data safe. In addition, MinIO Erasure Coding is at the object level and can recover one object at a time. In the case of RAID, recovery can only be done at the volume level, resulting in high downtime. Since MinIO encodes each object individually, it can cure objects incrementally. Storage servers, once deployed, should not require disk replacement or healing for the life of the server. MinIO’s Erasure Coding backend is designed for operational efficiency and takes full advantage of hardware acceleration whenever available.<a

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Sergei is a veteran of the early days of the computing industry as it was developing in the Soviet Union. I had the pleasure of working and learning from him over the past year, and in that time I picked up more important lessons about both life and embedded programming than any amount of school could ever teach. The most striking lesson is the story of how and why, in late summer of 1986, Sergei decided to move his family out of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, my mentor Sergei was writing software for an SM-1800, a Soviet clone of the PDP-11.  The microcomputer was just installed at a railroad station near Sverdlovsk, a major shipping center for the U.S.S.R. at the time. The new system was designed to route train cars and cargo to their intended destinations, but there was a nasty bug that was causing random failures and crashes. The crashes would always occur once everyone had gone home for the night, but despite extensive investigation, the computer always performed flawlessly during manual and automatic testing procedures the next day. Usually this indicates a race condition or some other concurrency bug that only manifests itself under certain circumstances. Tired of late night phone calls from the station, Sergei decided to get to the bottom of it, and his first step was to learn exactly which conditions in the rail yard were causing the computer to crash.</p>
<p>He first compiled a history of all occurrences of the unexplained crashes and plotted their dates and times on a calendar. Sure enough, a pattern was clearly visible.  By observing the behavior for several more days, Sergei saw he could easily predict the timing of future system failures.</p>
<p>He soon figured out that the rail yard computer malfunctioned only when the cargo being processed was live cattle coming in from northern Ukraine and western Russia heading to a nearby slaughterhouse. In and of itself this was strange, as the local slaughterhouse had in the past been supplied with livestock from farms located much closer, in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>As you may know, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster occurred in 1986 and spread deadly levels of radiation which to this day make the nearby area uninhabitable. The radioactivity caused broad contamination in the surrounding areas, including northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.  Suspicious of possibly high levels of radiation in the incoming train cars, Sergei devised a method to test his theory. Possession of personal Geiger counters was restricted by the Soviet government, so he went drinking with a few military personnel stationed at the rail yard. After a few shots of vodka, he was able to convince a soldier to measure one of the suspected rail cars, and they discovered the radiation levels were orders of magnitude above normal.</p>
<p>Not only were the cattle shipments highly contaminated with radiation, the levels were high enough to randomly flip bits in the memory of the SM-1800, which was located in a building close to the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>There were often significant food shortages in the Soviet Union, and the government plan was to mix the meat from Chernobyl-area cattle with the uncontaminated meat from the rest of the country. This would lower the average radiation levels of the meat without wasting valuable resources. Upon discovering this, Sergei immediately filed immigration papers with any country that would listen. The computer crashes resolved themselves as radiation levels dropped over time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humans have been terrible stewards of the environment. Mining, deforestation, pollution, overuse of freshwater, sprawl, depletion of natural resources—even before the threat of global warming became apparent, the authors of the book <em>The Limits of Growth</em>, almost 50 years ago, tried to warn humanity that the planet’s ecosystems could not survive under the assault of development without a consciously planned restructuring of society. Now both calamities, of ecosystem destruction and climate catastrophe, are feeding each other and accelerating the extinction of species—including, perhaps, humans as well.</p>
<p>We can turn back toward long-term survival, but only if we reconstruct a civilization that mimics nature in one important area that we have only barely initiated—the large-scale recycling and reusing of almost everything we produce. Since no one wants to reuse pollution, if enforced this principle would eliminate air and water pollution as well. Thus, when we manufacture, as explained in the section about manufacturing, the goods produced must be recyclable and reusable, so that we can eliminate most mining, and the attendant ecosystem destruction. One big advantage of replacing all fossil fuels is that the environmental destruction caused by the extraction of oil, coal, and natural gas will also be eliminated. In addition, we can manufacture everything, including chemicals, without pollution, and if we can’t, then we won’t produce it.</p>
<p>Agriculture, instead of mimicking the cycles of ecosystems, has also been set up in such a way that the inputs, like pesticides and artificial fertilizer, cause further environmental havoc, and the outputs, water pollution and unhealthy food, cause problems at the other end. Humans have been warping these natural ecosystems in order to maximize short-term efficiency—but as so often happens in our modern civilization, this short-term productivity leads to long-term collapse. The destruction of soil, which is the very foundation of terrestrial life, is proceeding apace, as is the pollution of water sources. Global warming will make things worse, and indeed the deforestation and destruction of critical ecosystems, including prairies and wetlands, is contributing to global warming in what is called a “positive feedback loop,” one increasing the other, until there will be no way to grow food for billions of people.</p>
<p>Misuse of ecosystems in general, including agriculture and deforestation, contributes about 12.5% and 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions respectively—that is, about 28% in total, and other sources from land misuse, such as methane from landfills, adds another 2.5%, so fully 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed directly to destroying ecosystems. The landfill part can be dealt with by recycling and reusing, including for food products which can be used for compost, for example, and thus our program includes a Recycling Corps. For agriculture and deforestation, we need to add other solutions.</p>
<p>Much of deforestation comes about simply to give livestock, particularly cattle, pasture to feed, as in the Amazon, and much of the rest comes from clearing forest to grow crops, such as palm oil in Borneo. As part of the Global Green New Deal, much of this could be stopped by exchanging green machinery from rich countries for preservation of critical ecosystems in poor ones. In addition, reforestation will be a necessary part of a path to making the planet habitable. In the United States, reforestation actually already decreases the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions. A new Civilian Conservation Corps can have as its main objectives two core tasks: to restore ecosystems, and to plant trees. Both will help to decrease emissions and to rebuild ecosystems that are critical to health and well-being.</p>
<p>Restoring ecosystems and planting trees will also help the agricultural sector, which needs trees and healthy ecosystems to provide services like minimizing flooding, cleaning air and water, and providing a place for beneficial organisms like insects and birds to grow. We must move towards an agricultural system that does not use pesticides, which are hazardous, not only to the health of humans, but as we are discovering, also to the existence of critical insect and other populations. These pesticides are getting into everything, even mother’s milk. The federal government needs to spend hundreds of billions to convert the nation’s farms to grow organic food that will be cheaper, better tasting, and healthier than what we have now.</p>
<p>Artificial fertilizer kills the soil, and the runoff ruins river and ocean ecosystems. We need to rebuild the soil in order to draw down carbon as well. Soil should be considered a strategic national resource, like oil is today.</p>
<p>Livestock, if allowed to rotate throughout parts of a well-functioning ecosystem, can benefit agricultural ecosystems. This sustainable livestock must replace the horrible factory-farmed livestock system, which makes the general population ill, partly because of the miserable existence of the livestock. In addition, we need to make fruits, vegetables, and healthy grains much cheaper and more available so that people can easily try alternatives to meat.</p>
<p>Another aspect of a global Green New Deal should be to patrol the world’s oceans and ensure that fishing stocks are allowed to expand to the point where they are sustainable. Currently humans are embarking on the insane venture of wiping out most edible wild fish. A sustainable world will be one where people get much of their protein from well-protected ocean and river sources.</p>
<p>The transformation to organic agriculture will make it more practical for people to choose a diet richer in vegetables and plant-based proteins, including those who are vegetarians and vegans for health, environmental, and ethical reasons.</p>
<p>The transformation of agriculture can even benefit from the expansion of walkable neighborhoods in cities, which can be used to establish networks of urban gardens. In addition, a Green New Deal should encourage the establishment of farm belts around urban regions to encourage local food production.</p>
<p>There is much to be done to prevent ecosystem collapse, and there are many benefits to doing so. A healthy agricultural system leads to healthy people, eating better-tasting food. Restored ecosystems can be left for future generations to enjoy, provided such “ecotourism” takes place in a sustainable and caring way. By restoring forests, wetlands, and soil, we can have a fighting chance of drawing down enough carbon dioxide to avert climate catastrophe. Why should humanity be denied the wonders of forests so a few oligarchs can buy more mansions and yachts?</p>

    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
      By 2018,
      Pannini will be the object of serious study.
      But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini will be almost unknown in
      the West.
      This means that Pannini will have no direct effect
      on the other events in this timeline.

    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly distinguish programming a computer (software)
    as a separate field from
    building the computer itself (hardware).<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question 
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application to language
      of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      publishes his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach will
      dominate American lingustics for
      over two decades.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bloomfield's "Postulates" defines a "language" as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      [t]he totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that there is no reference in this definition to the usual view --
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language
      because he wants linguistics to be taken
      seriously as science.
      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This will be important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      in 1945 and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      is different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser works on
      the design of what we will come to call a compiler<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p>
    
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    
    <p>Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning very close to one of its traditional senses:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      will acquire a different meaning,
      one specific to the computer field.
      By 1956, programs like Hoppers will
      no longer be called
      <term>compilers</term><a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Kleene discovers regular languages<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>.
      Kleene does not use regular expression notation,
      but his regular languages are the idea behind
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Glennie discovers what Knuth will later
      call the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>
      compiler.
      (By this Knuth will mean that
      AUTOCODE was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.)
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      is very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It does not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE is hard-to-use,
      and apparently sees little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie works for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      are routinely classified,</p></div>

As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think.

These include, for example:</p><ul><li>Finding the <strong>shared properties</strong> of similar polynomials</li><li>Formalizing the <strong>general pattern</strong> of a sequence</li><li>Establishing a <a href="#otoc"><strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong></a> between two sets</li><li>Constructing an alternate <a href="#axiom"><strong>axiomatic system</strong></a> for Euclidean geometry</li></ul><p>At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a <strong>broaden applicability</strong> to a field — along with some <strong>unification</strong> in between the fields.</p><div><p>Did You Know?</p><p>While abstraction is involved in pretty much all subfields of mathematics, it is particularly well-represented in fields such as <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, <strong>model theory</strong>, <strong>axiomatic set theory</strong> and <a href="#nonsense"><strong>category theory</strong></a>.</p></div><h2 id="nonsense"><a href="#toc">Abstract Nonsense</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18333"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram.png" alt="Category Theory: A Category with Objects and Morphisms" width="325" height="325" title="Category Theory Diagram"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18333">A category with objects $A$, $B$, $C$ and a series of morphisms.</figcaption></figure><p>A colloquial term for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">category theory</a></strong> (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of <a href="#structure">mathematical structures</a>), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.</p><p><span>Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a category, category theory can be regarded as a <strong>unifying theory</strong> of mathematics — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p>In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found. And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" title="Dart and Board"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</figcaption></figure><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., <strong>linear ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (<strong>exponential ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (<strong>ansatz of particular solution</strong>).</li></ul><p>Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a <strong>framework</strong>, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.</p><h2 id="arbitrarily"><a href="#toc">Arbitrarily</a></h2><p>An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “<strong>X with little limitation or restraint</strong>.” For example:</p><ul><li>An <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily small</strong> positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily long</strong> progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number — regardless the size of the latter.</li></ul><p>In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of <strong>degree</strong> and <strong>ordering</strong> are involved (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polynomial ring</a>).</p><div><p>Caution</p><p>Don’t make the mistake in assuming that “arbitrarily” means “infinitely”! If anything, “arbitrarily” usually carries a sense of being “without bound within the finite realm.”</p></div><h2 id="arbitrary"><a href="#toc">Arbitrary</a></h2><p>An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence). It corresponds to the term “<strong>any</strong>” and the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/logic-symbols/#Quantifiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical quantifier</a> $\forall$, and hints at an element of generality in the phrase where it’s found (e.g., statement $P$ holds for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$).&nbsp;</p><div><p>Arbitrary vs. Random</p><p>While “random” and “arbitrary” are often used interchangeably in informal discourses, in mathematics, “random” — unlike “arbitrary” — usually presupposes that the outcomes follow a <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a>, and as such might have predictable probabilities even if the outcomes are subject to chance and unpredictability.</p></div><h2 id="axiom"><a href="#toc">Axiom</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18546" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18546"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Parallel-Postulate.png" alt="Illustration of Parallel Postulate" width="320" height="240" title="Parallel Postulate"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18546">Pictorial representation of the parallel postulate</figcaption></figure><p>Axioms, also known as postulates, are mathematical premises which are assumed to be<strong>&nbsp;true</strong> and along with <a href="#def">definitions</a>, form the foundation of a <a href="#theory">mathematical <span>theory</span></a>.</p><p>In general, axioms can be divided into two types: <strong>logica</strong>l and <strong>non-logical</strong>.

I didn't know it at the time, but this was going to be one of the most impactful experiences in my life.</p><figure><p><img alt="Rat infested office" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef609325c969f70601c7074/5ef60adf83cbb075d3c38022_image-asset.jpeg"></p><figcaption>Rat infested office</figcaption></figure><p>Hockey stick growth, constant change, and incredibly high pressure. I was hired to manage the SDR team that was responsible for generating every meeting conducted by the account executives. My team started with 3 and quickly grew to a team of 12 SDRs fighting daily to hit aggressive metrics.</p><p>I loved every second of it.</p><p>We started in a small office with rats... literally. In under two years, the company grew by 600%+ and achieved a 21 million dollar series B funding round.</p><p>Yes, we did upgrade the office situation along the way.</p><p>Every deal closed by the account executives had come from the SDR team. Managing and scaling the SDR team was not easy, but I am proud of how we did it and what the team achieved.</p><p>In this article, I'll share some of my story and what I learned along the way.</p><h2><strong>Learning #1: The core of our success was daily motivation. Not incentives.</strong></h2><p>There was one situation during my startup experience that really stands out and illustrates the power of motivation. There was less than a week left in the month and my team was behind on their quota by a significant amount, it basically wasn't going to happen. Morale was down and despite my efforts of cheering up the team, they felt down on their luck. Then something special happened.</p><p>The entire company was packed in our small conference room for an "all hands" meeting. There wasn't enough space in the room and 10 people had to stand outside and cup their hands over their ears just to hear. I was one of those people.</p><p>My boss was giving his update and said: "As for the SDR team, they are not going to get close to hitting quota this month."</p><p>My jaw hit the floor, you never claim defeat before the final bell tolls.</p><p>I quickly said "hey!" a little too loud as I squeezed passed my colleagues to get into the conference room. The entire company was staring at me and you could hear a pin drop.</p><p>I wasn't thinking, I was reacting.</p><p>"Don't count us out. Does it look like we will hit quota? No. Not even close. But what I can tell you is that if ANY team can do it, its this one. Do NOT count us out."</p><p>The next day I pulled my team aside in the morning and addressed what happened the day before. We all agreed. We were going to make them eat their words.</p><p>What happened next was nothing short of amazing. I had never seen my team so fired up. They were cheering each other on, laughing together, and booking more meetings than they even thought possible.</p><p>Over the next four days, they broke their "most meetings booked in a day" record twice.</p><p>And when the final bell tolled, we were short by one meeting.</p><p>You would have thought we had beat our quota by 200%. They didn't care that we missed our team quota by one. They were ecstatic that when everyone in the company thought we couldn't get close, we did.</p><p><strong>Incentives are important but they do not replace the ability to motivate a team around an objective.</strong></p><p>A team is a group of individuals rallied around a specific objective. Unfortunately, the daily work often has a way of causing the individual to lose sight of that objective. This is very prevalent in SDR teams because the daily work comes with rejection, repetitive tasks, and variables outside of their control.</p><p>After that experience, I started spending 10 minutes every morning with my team reminding them of why we are doing this. Pointing at our previous successes and pointing to the potential successes on the horizon. I never stopped motivating the team. I never stopped reminding them of what we accomplished and challenging them to repeat it.</p><p>The next month was the biggest one we had ever had.</p><p>Incentives are important but they do not replace the ability to motivate a team around an objective.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Create a schedule with daily objectives. Share it with the team and motivate them by connecting each daily objective with a larger goal.</p><h2>Learning #2: Motivation is about narratives, you must create compelling ones.</h2><p>Motivating my team was necessary because we had to make changes so frequently. There was one change in particular that really stands out. We decided to change our entire target market. yeah, a big decision. Because of this, my team was going to have fewer leads and entirely different messaging. Needless to say, they were going to be less than thrilled. In order for us to be able to execute, I needed to get them excited about the change.</p><p>The first step was, I had to be on board. The team leader must believe in the initiative. Fortunately, that was easy. I was totally on board and ready to tackle the challenge.</p><p>The second step was, the team needed to understand the reason behind the change and agree that it was necessary.</p><p>The third and final step was the most challenging. I needed to motivate the team to execute. This required a strong narrative.</p><p>When it came time to tell my team about the change they jumped on board quickly. There were a few concerns that I addressed and then we shifted our focus quickly. I attribute how well received it was to the type of people we hired and to the work I did planning how to deliver the message.</p><p>Here is the template I used to construct the message and successfully motivate the team to execute.</p><p><strong>The "why" behind this change:</strong></p><p><strong>Why us:</strong></p><p><strong>What happens when this change is successful:</strong></p><p><strong>What this means for them:</strong></p><p><strong>How we can exceed expectations:</strong></p><p>Startups change a lot. This requires employees to adapt quickly and often. It can be exhausting. Building a narrative around every change is how you can motivate the team and get them on board. This results in them adapting more quickly with less change fatigue.</p><p><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Expect change, don't just react to it. Create a plan that covers "what to do" and "how to communicate it" for major outcomes (new leadership, hirings/firings, etc).</p><h2>Learning #3: Take ownership of everything.</h2><p>When my team was at its peak of 12 people I was managing a lot of different personalities. One rep, in particular, was always late to meetings, skipped out of our one on ones, and intentionally isolated themselves from the team. It was very challenging for me because I liked them a lot as a person but as a member of the team, they were very tough to manage. As their performance slipped I tried to help but it kept getting worse. Finally, they told me that they felt "better than the role" and it all made sense. They were embarrassed to be an SDR because they viewed it as a step back in their career.</p><p>Due to poor performance, I ended up having to let go of this employee, something I take very seriously. I reflected on this for a long time as it was my first experience firing someone. It hit me hard.</p><p>I wanted to chalk it up to them feeling "better than the role" but I had to take ownership of something to learn and grow from the experience. I reflected on what was in my control and determined that I enabled their belief that they were better than the role. The truth is, at the time I felt that they had more experience than me. My own insecurities were exposed through my actions. I didn't hold them accountable, I didn't effectively communicate my concerns, and frankly...</p><p>I didn't do a great job as their leader.</p><p>There will always be things outside of your control, it's inevitable. It's easy to point to the uncontrollable variables and assign blame. While scaling an SDR team you must take ownership of everything and focus your energy on what is/was in your control.</p><p>I learned from that experience and have never let it happen again.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Regardless of the situation take ownership of the result. Find what was in your control, identify what you could of done better, and improve.</p><h2>Learning #4: Cut poor performers.</h2><p>While leading the SDR team I got extremely close to each and every one. I felt invested in them as SDRs and as people. I wanted everyone to succeed and I would go to great lengths to help them improve.</p><p>But when it came time to cut ties, I would clam up. I tied so much of my success as a manager to the success of each individual on the team, remember the whole "take ownership of everything" thing from above? The idea of accepting defeat by letting go of an SDR crushed me.</p><p>Once you've been in a leadership position for a long enough time you learn that the team itself should be looked at as an individual. Once the repetitive actions of one team member hurt the team as a whole a leader must act.</p><p>I now follow a simple rule. I put a lot of energy into helping a struggling SDR improve. If they do not take action on my support and continue to perform poorly, I let them go. If they do take action on my support, and still perform poorly, I try to get them a different role at the company. James Collins, in his book Good to Great, says "put the right person in the right seat." If you have a great employee who is struggling in the role, you should find the right role for them.</p><p><strong>Action tip:</strong> Do not hesitate to cut poor performers. Additionally, if you have the right person make sure that they are in "the right seat."</p><h2>Learning #5: Hire the right people.</h2><p>The first group of SDRs I hired was an eclectic group. An international policy expert, Alaskan snowmobile racer, capital investment analyst, and a kid who almost flunked out of college because his kidney exploded. They all shared two things in common. They were very hard working and had a quirky personality that made them stand out.</p><p>Hiring is very challenging, especially when you are a startup. A wrong hire costs money but also another valuable resource for startups. Time. There is no debate about the importance of hiring the right people.</p><p>My hiring philosophy - Hire hardworking people with unique personalities.</p><p>If you are able …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-141518467573597169" itemprop="articleBody">

<p><img data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1176" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8iAON90hE8/X0u6DaURFlI/AAAAAAAAEzI/dENaZvr7StEWfYHQXURz4wBd_D_XA73bACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/multitenancy.png" width="640"></p>


<p>Multi-tenancy Application Deployment Architecture could be modeled in 4 broad ways:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no right or wrong here. It's about choice and consequence that you should consider taking into your business context and constraints. In this post I intend to jot down a some key points to keep in mind for each of these multi-tenant architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Easiest to implement from development and deployment stand-point.</li>
		<li>Just automate the deployment infrastructure for every tenant for quick set-up.</li>
		<li>Most expensive of all the models from infrastructure cost stand-point.</li><li>Relatively longer deployment time for newer application versions, at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>More wastage from infrastructure resource utilization point of view.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:
			<ul><li>not holding user-request data</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Suitability:
		<ul>
			<li>This is the best way to begin your SAAS platform, for product-market fitment until stability and growth.</li>
			<li>When you provide SAAS as white-labelled product.</li>
			<li>When you deploy your SAAS product at client infrastructure, maybe for compliance reasons.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Challenges:
		<ul>
			<li>How do you optimize resources for cost?</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>The most complex beast of all the multi-tenancy architectures.</li>
		<li>Maximizing infra utilization every bit for maximum profitability.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customizations on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A model where tenant specific configuration are tied to deployed instances, but all share a common database. The data isolation per client is achieved by prefixing database schema with tenant info.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You got many web-frameworks and web-plugins supporting this model of prefixing-queries with tenant specific data, to hit the right datasource. For example, <a href="https://github.com/influitive/apartment" target="_blank">apartment</a> (rails/ruby), <a href="https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant" target="_blank">multi-tenant</a> (laravel/php), springboot (java), etc.</li>
		<li>Relational database instances are expensive. It way pricier than your application instances and is not as disposable as your compute instances can are. You got to do a bit of forward looking into future for its capacity planning.</li>
		<li>When you are managing your database instance as a SaaS provider and want to optimize on the overall cost, often the easiest thing to do is use shared database.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
</div>
<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A request can hit any of the available application instance.</li>
		<li>Tenant specific configuration is got dynamically with every request.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding tenant's configuration</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you hit the right database dynamically on a per request basis? How do you do it optimally for latency? Think&nbsp; of Atlassian suite of products like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile" target="_blank">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a>etc.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customization on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul><p>Hope that helps you in your design choice for your SAAS architecture...</p>

<section itemprop="text">
<p>Hugging Face recently released <a href="https://huggingface.co/models?search=Helsinki-NLP%2Fopus-mt">1008 translation models</a> for almost 140 languages on their model hub.</p>
<p>These models were originally trained by <a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/j%C3%B6rg-tiedemann">Jörg Tiedemann</a> of the <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/">Language Technology Research Group at the University of Helsinki</a>. They were trained on the <a href="http://opus.nlpl.eu/">Open Parallel Corpus(OPUS)</a> using a neural machine translation framework called <a href="https://marian-nmt.github.io/">MarianNMT</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain how you can use the MarianMT models to augment data text data.</p>
<h2 id="back-translation">Back Translation</h2>
<p>We will use a data augmentation technique called “Back Translation”. In this, we take an original text written in English. Then, we convert it into another language (eg. French) using MarianMT. We translate the French text back into English using MarianMT. We keep the back-translated English text if it is different from the original English sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/back-translation-marianmt.png" alt="Backtranslation with MarianMT"></p>
<h2 id="augmentation-process-">Augmentation Process <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J_KpNYj03gecT0p9s6YeDcDJHKgPn1Hh?usp=sharing"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a></h2>
<p>First, we need to install Hugging Face transformers and Moses Tokenizers with the following command</p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> transformers 
pip <span>install </span>mosestokenizer
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After installation, we can now import the MarianMT model and tokenizer.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>,</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, we can create a initialize the model that can translate from English to Romance languages. This is a single model that can translate to any of the romance languages()</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>target_model_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ROMANCE'</span>
<span>target_tokenizer</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>target_model_name</span><span>)</span>
<span>target_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>target_model_name</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similarly, we can initialize models that can translate Romance languages to English.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_model_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ROMANCE-en'</span>
<span>en_tokenizer</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianTokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>en_model_name</span><span>)</span>
<span>en_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>MarianMTModel</span><span>.</span><span>from_pretrained</span><span>(</span><span>en_model_name</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we write a helper function to translate a batch of text given the machine translation model, tokenizer and the target romance language.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>,</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>,</span> <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Prepare the text data into appropriate format for the model
</span>    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>text</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>if</span> <span>language</span> <span>==</span> <span>"en"</span> <span>else</span> <span>f"</span><span>{</span><span>language</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;&lt; </span><span>{</span><span>text</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>src_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>template</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>text</span> <span>in</span> <span>texts</span><span>]</span>

    <span># Tokenize the texts
</span>    <span>encoded</span> <span>=</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>prepare_translation_batch</span><span>(</span><span>src_texts</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span># Generate translation using model
</span>    <span>translated</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>encoded</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Convert the generated tokens indices back into text
</span>    <span>translated_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>tokenizer</span><span>.</span><span>batch_decode</span><span>(</span><span>translated</span><span>,</span> <span>skip_special_tokens</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>translated_texts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, we will prepare a function to use the above <code>translate()</code> function to perform back translation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Translate from source to target language
</span>    <span>fr_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>texts</span><span>,</span> <span>target_model</span><span>,</span> <span>target_tokenizer</span><span>,</span> 
                         <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>target_lang</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Translate from target language back to source language
</span>    <span>back_translated_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>fr_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>en_model</span><span>,</span> <span>en_tokenizer</span><span>,</span> 
                                      <span>language</span><span>=</span><span>source_lang</span><span>)</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>back_translated_texts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, we can perform data augmentation using back-translation from English to Spanish on a list of sentences as shown below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>

<span>aug_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"es"</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"Yeah, it's so cool."</span><span>,</span> <span>"It's the food I hated."</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were of great help.'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Similarly, we can perform augmentation using English to French as shown below with the exact same helper method.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>
<span>aug_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>back_translate</span><span>(</span><span>en_texts</span><span>,</span> <span>source_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>,</span> <span>target_lang</span><span>=</span><span>"fr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>aug_texts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"It's so cool."</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated food.'</span><span>,</span> <span>"They've been very helpful."</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="chained-back-translation">Chained Back Translation</h2>
<p>You can also run back translation in a chain to get more diversity. For example, <code>English -&gt; Spanish -&gt; English -&gt; French -&gt; English</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>en_texts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'This is so cool'</span><span>,</span> <span>'I hated the food'</span><span>,</span> <span>'They were very helpful'</span><span>]</span>

<h2 id="alternative-applications">Alternative Applications</h2>
<p>Besides data augmentation, the back translation process can also be used for text paraphrasing.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can also use it as an adversarial attack. Suppose we have a training dataset on which we trained an NLP model. Then, we can augment the training dataset and generate prediction from our model on augmented texts. If the predictions are different than our ground-truth labels, then we have a list of texts where our model fails. We can get good insights by analyzing those responses.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, MarianMT is a decent free and offline alternative to Google Translate for back-translation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598677527863/dI1P7tXJc.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Do you write blogs?  Have you ever struggled to create cover images for your blogs? 
Well, I did. So I have made a tool that will help you create awesome cover images for your blogs quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598169671591/BKzp2hZnU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="frame_chrome_mac_dark (1).png"></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">🗃 The problem</h2>
<p>I started blogging a few months back. It's one of the best decisions I have ever made. But every time I wanted to write a post, I had to create and edit a cover image for it. I mean I love creating creative cover images but sometimes I feel I just spend too much time designing it.</p>
<p>And then I saw these comments on my posts.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598092132300/CLWYZEN_X.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="comments.png"></p>
<p>I use <em>canva</em>. It's a nice tool. But I thought I need something minimal so that creating those cover images won't be any hassle. Coincidently I just started learning <strong>react</strong>. I knew some basics and I thought why not implement my knowledge of react and make something out of it. Also, it might help someone else too. And that's how I came up with the idea of this project.  </p>
<h2 id="the-process">🛠 The process</h2>
<p>I started working on this as a fun project. I had an exact visualization of what I wanted to create. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598290323414/bt061ZVRr.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="coverview layout.png"></p>
<p>So I first created a design of a cover image that can be used as the template user can edit. I asked my self what things I would like to add or what can I do to make the cover image more appealing. And I started playing with it. It was fun. After spending a lot of time, solving problems and finding solutions, this is what I came up with the first build.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598290972723/9vlpR1JTN.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="cover.gif"></p>
<h2 id="the-final-outcome">📦 The final outcome</h2>
<p>I shared it on Twitter and Linkedin and I got a really good response from the developer community. I always wanted to contribute to open source. There are multiple ways to contribute and one of which is creating open-source projects. I open-sourced it. This is my first open-source project with react.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rutikwankhade/CoverView"><img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=rutikwankhade&amp;repo=CoverView" alt="ReadMe Card"></a> </p>
<p>And within a few hours, I got my first pull request. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/asish_io">Asish Raju</a> made his first open-source contribution by contributing to my project. He added a few more customizable options and refactored the code.</p>
<p>For the first time, I was on the other side of a project. I learned how to manage pull requests, review code, and merged his pull request. <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.guide/">Open Source Guides</a> is a great resource to learn.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Then I improved it little by little and added some more features. Here are a few noteworthy features of <a target="_blank" href="https://coverview.now.sh/">CoverView</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>🛠 Create awesome cover images for your blogs quickly and easily</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>🌈 Choose different colors for background, foreground, border, and text</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>✨ Choose from 15+ different background patterns</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598343038364/Gl097ze-t.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="patterns bg sm.gif"></p>
<ul>
<li>👨‍💻 Add dev icons and author name for personal branding</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>💾 Download cover images in <code>.png</code> as well as <code>.jpeg</code> format</li>
</ul>
<p>I just had a lot of fun making this. You might not be able to create a lot more creative images But having a nice cover is always better than having some random image or no cover image at all.</p>

<p>So check out <a target="_blank" href="https://coverview.now.sh/">CoverView</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The important lesson I learned while building this is that you don't need to learn a language or framework completely to start making projects. You can start applying while learning it. I feel this way we can learn from our mistakes and understand the importance of one concept over others. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the moment Kubernetes is one of the most exciting technologies in the world of DevOps. Recently a lot of hype has formed around it for one simple reason, and this reason is the mighty containers.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-2.JPG" alt="Infrastructure"></p>
<p>Once upon a time, and it wasn't so long ago, we still ran applications on server hardware. We had a website that spins on a hardware server and a database that stores the website's state. Users visit the site, everything was cool, everything worked.</p>
<p>The website become successful and our company grows. Then the website becomes more and more complex and evolves into a platform with a <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/thoughts-on-microservices">bunch of services</a>.</p>
<p>Then along came virtual machines (VMs), and we could run multiple operating systems and applications on a single machine. This empowered company to run ten times or more server instances on a single server. But what if we could run even more server programs on a single server if we left behind the bulk of the VM's operating system? That would give us, even bigger cost savings and flexibility. And the containers came along.</p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DbqFymX.png" alt="How Docker was born"></p><p>Docker containers have been the de facto development standard for quite some time now, but interestingly enough, Docker is not a pioneer in the container world.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-3.JPG" alt="History"></p>
<p>Docker is based on namespaces and cgroups technologies (the first one provides isolation, the second one provides process grouping and resource limitation), so in terms of virtualization, it's not much different from LXC/OpenVZ which historically came first. Same native speed, same isolation methods based on Linux kernel machinery. However, at a higher level, it's a very different story. The highlight of Docker is that it allows you to deploy a fully virtual environment, run an application on it, and easily manage it.</p>
<p>Like a virtual machine, the Docker runs its processes in its own pre-configured operating system. However, all the docker processes run on a physical host server sharing the processors and available memory with all the other processes running in the host system. The approach used by the Docker is in the middle between running everything on the physical server and full virtualization offered by virtual machines. This approach is called <em>containerization</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-4.JPG" alt="Docker internals"></p>
<p>Starting with Linux containers, the excitement moved to Docker containers, while increasing the need for <em>container orchestration</em>.</p>
<p>Back to our story. At some point, the company has realized that the current server is not sufficient, no matter how big it is (vertical scaling). The history moves to the next phase — the company buys more servers and divides the load between them (horizontal scaling).</p>
<p>The IT team tasks are getting harder and harder. They need to bother harder with problems like updates, patches, monitoring, security, backups, durability, reliability, resiliency... which means pagerduty at 6 am on Sunday...</p>
<p>Cloud!</p>
<p>Cool, now all we have to worry about is application logic. But the complexity of the highly available distributed system didn't go anywhere — it's just moved to the complexity of orchestrating and connecting the infrastructure components. Deployments, service discovery, gateway configurations, monitoring, replication, consistency...</p>
<p>It was a short story as we have come to this day. Now we have a distributed system with a bunch of services inside a bunch of containers in the cloud.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p><em>Don't flatter yourself, even though I've been working with Kubernetes I only know the tip of the iceberg. So here will be not a deep dive, but rather a smooth flight over existing subsystems and concepts.</em></p>
<p>Kubernetes is a sophisticated mechanism designed to make systems scalable, resilient, and easy to deploy. It allows us to automate container orchestration — starting, scaling, managing containerized applications including cluster management, scheduling, service discovery, monitoring, secrets management, and more.</p>
<p>Kubernetes allows to automate the start and rollback of deployments, Kubernetes manages the resources and can scale the required resources for the applications depending on how much they need in order to avoid waste of resources. So k8s essentially is <strong>process automation</strong>. Applications in k8s are rolled out and tested without administrators. The developer writes a script and then the cloud magic happens. So, in the ideal world of Kubernetes, all operational support of the software lies on the shoulders of programmers, and administrators make sure that the layer of cloud infrastructure — that is, Kubernetes itself - works steadily. That's why companies go to the clouds to completely remove the routine of their administration and do only development.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the coolest features of Kubernetes is that it helps <strong>standardize the work with Cloud Service Provider</strong>. No matter which CSP we are talking about, working with Kubernetes always looks the same. The developer, in a <strong>declarative manner</strong>, tells the Kubernetes what he needs, and Kubernetes works with system resources, helping the developer to abstract from the implementation details of the platform.</p>
<p>Originally, Kubernetes was a Google project that took into account the shortcomings of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>, the ancestor of Kubernetes. Google uses Kubernetes to manage its gigantic infrastructure of millions of containers. At some point, Google gave the Kubernetes to the world, namely the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. So far, Docker has added the Kubernetes as one of the orchestrators — Kubernetes is now part of the Docker Community and Docker Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has many names among which are <em>kube</em> or <em>k8s</em> (I like cool acronyms with numbers and will use it further).</p>
<p>The Kubernetes itself is one huge piece of abstraction. These abstractions are mapped to virtual or physical infrastructure. To understand how it works, we must first understand its basic components.</p>
<h3>Pod</h3>
<p>The pod is the smallest unit that can be launched on a cluster node. It is a group of containers that should work together for some reason. The containers in the pod share port numbers, Linux kernel namespaces, and network stack settings. So when you scale your application within k8s, you should increase the number of pods rather than the number of containers in one particular pod. By <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy">default</a> containers inside pods are restarted automatically fixing intermittent problems for you. So even on these basic level k8s keeps your containers running and with a little additional effort, you can tune it to get even more reliability.</p>
<p>Quite often (but not always) there is only one container underneath the pod. But pod abstraction provides additional flexibility when, for example, two containers need to share the same data warehouse, or if there is a connection between them using interprocess communication, or if they are closely connected for some other reason, all this can be implemented by running them in the same pod.</p>
<p>Thus, you can easily draw parallels with existing code primitives and distributed primitives in k8s. Class is a container image, an object is a container instance, a pod is a deployment unit, the composition can be achieved via sidecar pattern, etc.</p>
<p>Another flexibility of pods is that they do not require the use of Docker containers. If necessary, you can also use other application containerization technologies, such as <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a>.</p>
<h3>Desired state</h3>
<p>The desired state is one of the basic concepts of k8s. You can specify the required state of running pods instead of writing how to achieve that state. For example, if a pod stops working for some reason, k8s will recreate the pod based on the specified desired state.</p>
<p>K8s always checks the state of the containers in the cluster, and this is done by the control loops on the so-called Kubernetes Master, which is part of the control plane. We'll talk about it a bit later.</p>
<h3>Objects in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>An object in k8s is a record of intent — the desired cluster state. And after the object is created, the k8s will constantly check for this object state. In addition, the objects also serve as an additional abstraction layer above the container interface. You can interact with the objects' entities instead of interacting directly with containers.</p>
<p>Almost every k8s object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status.</p>
<p><strong>Pod</strong> that we talked about earlier is just one of the k8s objects.</p>
<p>Pods are mortal — they are born and die but in order to be able to communicate with pods and for them to be able to communicate with each other abstraction of the <strong>Service</strong> has been introduced. Service plays the role of an access point to sets of pods that provide the same functionality as the underlying pods. There are different types of services, ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName. By default k8s use ClusterIP — it exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, so you can only access it using the Kubernetes proxy.</p>
<p>Also for exposing services you can use <strong>Ingress</strong> object. Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as an entry point for your cluster. Ingress is a description of how traffic should flow from outside the cluster to your services, it acts as a "smart router" or ALB. It allows you to consolidate routing rules into a single resource, as it can aggregate multiple services under a single IP address.</p>
<p>For example, the web application can have a home page at <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com</a> and a shopping cart at <a href="https://example.com/cart">https://example.com/cart</a> and an API at <a href="https://example.com/api">https://example.com/api</a>. We could implement all of them in one pod, but in order for all of them to scale independently, we could decouple them into different pods and connect to Ingress.</p>
<p>K8s also has a huge number of controllers, such as <strong>ReplicaSet</strong> — it checks that a certain number of copies of pods are running, <strong>StatefulSet</strong> is used with stateful applications and distributed systems, <strong>DemonSet</strong> is used to copy pods to all nodes in the cluster or only to specified nodes, etc. They all implement a control loop — a non-terminating loop that monitors the state of its subsystems, then makes or requests …</p></div></div>

Here's the path as I see it:</p><p>The platform you choose is dependent on the medium you create in. </p><p>If you're a photographer or visual designer, Instagram is a great place to start. If you're a writer, then your own blog and a strong <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/twitter" target="_blank">presence on Twitter</a> maybe your first moves. If you're a videographer or actor, then YouTube is where you should build.</p><p>I started scaling my ideas through writing. I have three main platforms: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Squarespace</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Mailchimp</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Twitter</strong></p></li></ul><p>Squarespace hosts this site. I chose it because it's relatively easy to learn, and has a built-in "blog" function that makes writing and publishing content intuitive. Mailchimp handles my weekly <a href="https://www.wealest.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Quick-Reads newsletter</a>, which is also writing based. And Twitter is a natural complement for any writer because it's a word-based platform with 280 characters per tweet. </p><p>What's impressive about Twitter is that the algorithm helps you scale your ideas. You can start Tweeting and almost immediately begin to get impressions (the number of times people see your tweet) and profile visits (the number of people visiting your profile).</p><p>I recently wrote about the power of Twitter to <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/twitter" target="_blank">scale your personality</a> - you can read that article <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/twitter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595629321792_101159"><div>

</div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595629321792_105034"><div><h3>You Don’t Need A Technical Background To Build.</h3><p>The best thing about these platforms is that you don't need any kind of technical (coding) background to build on them. I didn't have one when I started, and I still don't. </p><p>For example, you can be up and running on Twitter in less than 10 minutes with very little technical knowledge. It will take a little longer to build a custom Squarespace site yourself, but nothing crazy. It took me about three weeks to make this version of <a href="https://wealest.com/" target="_blank">Wealest.com</a>, and it hasn't had a significant overhaul since it went live (even though it probably needs one!). </p><p>Squarespace has loads of built-in templates. Once you know the design basics, you can make big changes quickly. Or, you can just pay someone else to build it for you and focus on creating and publishing your work. </p><h3>There Are No-Code Platforms For Almost Everything. </h3><p>If you can imagine it, there is probably a software already built that does it for you. </p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/" target="_blank">Mighty Networks</a> is a platform that lets you to build entire forum communities around your content. You can even create custom courses (video and written) for your audience to purchase.</p><p><a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a> let's independent writers make a living off their writing with a newsletter / subscription package.</p><p>And <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> lets graphic designers build almost any design from scratch or pre-built templates.</p><p>You don't need to know how to code - just choose software and start creating.</p><h3>You Can Expand Your Platforms Over Time.</h3><p>I do recommend starting with just one or two platforms to make it easier to publish consistently. But you can always expand your platforms over time. </p><p>While I only have three main platforms right now, mostly text-based, I plan on adding Instagram, YouTube, and a Podcast in the next year.</p><p>To build an audience, you need to publish. What kinds of stuff should you post?</p><h3>Pick A Niche You’re Interested In Learning More About.</h3><p>You've probably heard the phrase, "write what you know." This is wrong (mostly).</p><p>Yes, you should always try and filter ideas through your unique experience. But that doesn't mean you can't just create content about the cool things you're learning in a particular field.</p><p>That's where I started. Wealest was born out of my hunger to learn the ideas of wealth creators. I didn't know anything about wealth creation before 2016. I just read a lot, filtered those ideas through my unique personality, and wrote about it. </p><p>So, pick something you're interested in and want to learn more about. Then create content around what you learn and how it applies to you.</p><h3>Production Is Better Than Perfection. </h3><p>Your first piece of content probably won't be great. That's ok! </p><p>When you publish consistently, you'll get feedback on what works and what doesn't. This will make your work better over time. Here's what that looks like:</p><p>Create → Publish →  Get Feedback → Iterate → Publish → Get Feedback → Iterate → Publish … and the cycle continues.  </p><p>The key is to keep publishing despite feeling like your work is not good enough. Production is better than perfection. You will get better.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595629321792_179684"><div><h3>How Often Should You Publish?</h3><p>It depends on what you're creating. I publish one long-form blog post a week, and it takes me about 5 hours from beginning to end. My newsletter also goes out once a week and takes about an hour. </p><p>You don't need to dedicated 20 hours a week to creating stuff and publishing. Find a pace that works for you, and stick with it. Consistency is the key.</p><h3>The Media You Create Has a Zero Marginal Cost of Reproduction.</h3><p>Internet media has a critical intrinsic characteristic that creates an enormous opportunity for creators: there's<strong> no marginal cost to reproduce it. </strong></p><p>Whether one person reads this article, or one million, the cost for me to write it is the same (about 5 hours of my time). Then it<em> </em><strong>scales</strong> without any cost of reproduction on my end to anyone with an internet connection. I write it once, and can then "ship it" to anyone around the world for free. This is the power of internet media. </p><p>No matter what you're interested in, there's someone else who's interested in the same thing you are. That's the incredible power of the internet. So, how do like-minded people find your work?</p><h2>Google Search</h2><p>Google Search is the most effective way to get traffic to your content. Once you start publishing consistently, Google will begin to rank you in their search results. Be warned: <strong>it takes a long time</strong> (six months to a year) to start ranking consistently. But it's well worth it. </p><p>Here's an example from my site: go search "asymmetric opportunity" on Google. What's the first result? </p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="40.65934065934066" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595546194912_44911"><div>

        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I do a fair amount of interviews, 60+ during the six months prior to COVID and during those I have noticed some common mistakes candidates make during the interview that are highly avoidable, so I thought I’d spend just a little bit of time writing those down and share them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1---not-asking-clarification-questions">#1 - Not Asking Clarification Questions</h3>
<p>Normally all tech companies make candidates go through at least one round of technical interview, where a problem is presented and the candidate needs to address it and solve it. This interviews can vary in form, ie. coding challenges where the candidate needs to do hands-on coding, architectural interviews where the candidate would need to design some “bigger” system and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of technical question you may be asked, it is very important to ask clarifying questions <strong>always</strong>. And I can’t stress enought the <strong>always</strong> here, even if you think the problem given is trivial, it is not, take a bit of time to think about it and questions will pop up in your mind. For instance, if I asked you during an coding interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>given a list of numbers, return two numbers such that one times the other results in 220</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think that this two-sentence problem is very clear. However questions that I would ask are “<em>is the list sorted</em>…<em>are the numbers unique</em>…<em>can I multiply a number to itself</em>…<em>what shall I return if there are multiple numbers meeting the criteria</em>”.</p>
<p>Asking clarifying questions is however not only important for you to provide the best solution possible. It is also important because it is what I would expect you to do in real life when coming in to my team and you’re given a problem to solve. I would expect you to ask questions to further scope the problem, discover corner cases, etc. and not just go back to your desk and start coding.</p>
<p>I normally tell candidates upfront “<em>feel free to ask any question that helps you clarify</em>”. If you are given that cue, it is because it is important for the process. Stop, think, and ask the questions that will surely pop up.</p>
<h3 id="2---not-keeping-your-interviewer-engaged">#2 - Not keeping your interviewer engaged</h3>
<p>There was a time where I found this sentence just be BS. I thought that the interview process was just about me solving or answering questions. I was dead wrong. Any good interview process is a two-way street, a process where the interviewer and the candidate <strong>collaborate</strong> during however long the interview is. And because they are collaborating, it is very important to keep the other party engaged.</p>
<p>“<em>How do I keep my interviewer engaged?</em>” you may ask. It is extremely simple, just <strong>think out loud</strong>, let the interviewer know how and where your thoughts are taking you. I know this can feel odd, or you may fear saying anything stupid, don’t. There is literally nothing you may say that would be interpreted as stupid.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud during an problem solving interview has several advantages in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious, you keep your interviewer engaged. We are all humans and it is very easy for us to let our mind wander off for a moment if the candidate is just silent while e.g. coding for 30 minutes. And as unfair as it might sound, an interviewer not paying attention, does not play on your side</li>
<li>the less obvious, it gives you more time. There are numerous instances where candidates that I interviewed just go silent during their coding or their architectural challenge and after a few minutes they just come with the solution. At that point I have lots of questions about the trade-offs they made, why they made them etc. Many of those questions could have been avoided by just walking me through that thought process, and that saves time that might be especially important when the solution is not completely correct.</li>
<li>the none obvious at all. <strong>Good interviewers are there to help you</strong>. Believe me, all good interviewers I know <strong>want the candidate to pass the interview</strong> and will do whatever possible (and within their limits) to help you succeed. So giving them early feedback on why/what/how you’re doing what you’re doing let them help you as soon as possible. For example, if I see that they path you’re taking will get you to a very bad solution, I will try to  ask subtle questions to make you to re-think about your current proposal and other possible trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3---not-prepare-for-the-interview">#3 - Not prepare for the interview</h3>
<p>This mistake may seem very hard to make, right? Who comes to an interview for a tech company not having done tons of leetcode problems, studying algorithms and data structures to the limit?
Well, this is one side of the preparation, the other one however is not so obvious.</p>
<p>Most tech companies have rounds of behavioral interviews and although these may or may not involve certain technical (very high level) questions, you also need to prepare for these. These kinds of interviews are more like an open discussion where you will be asked things related to your previous projects, your background, certain situations you faced in the past and how you approached them, interactions with your team mates, how have you led projects (if applicable), etc. And for all these, it is better to come prepared.</p>
<p>When I say prepared, I don’t mean that you invent, or “fake” the answers to these types of questions, believe me when I tell you that it is relatively easy to know when any of that is true with just two-three follow up questions.
What I mean when I say prepare is that you should spend some time thinking about those kinds of past situations, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>that time you led that project that was slipping the deadline, how did you approach that? what did you do? what was the outcome? what did you learn?</li>
<li>that time you were given not so good feedback by some of your peers, think about what you learnt, how you felt, how you dealt with that and what changed moving forward</li>
<li>that time you had to give feedback to some of your peers that was hard for you to give, think about how you did it, would you do it in the same way today? how do you think it went now in retrospect?</li>
<li>that time you were given a problem that required more broader knowledge than what you had at that moment, what did you do? how did you deliver/ did you enjoy the challenge or was it stressful?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>I see this preparation as going back to your past memories and reflect on them. This will help during the interview as your thoughts will be already in order and you will not have to pause for minutes to think about what to say, you will just know what past experience is most relevant for that moment, believe me.</p>
<p>It is also very important to remember, be <strong>completely honest</strong>. In these kinds of interviews there is no right or wrong answer, we are just trying to get to know you a bit better, your motives and motivations, where you excel and where there is still potential improvement, etc. All this helps you and the hiring manager have a good start on your first day at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>An interesting mistake with Go's <code>context</code> package that I (sort of) made</h2>

	<p><small>August 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today, <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/">Dave Cheney</a> did another Go pop quiz
<a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/1299846267850223616">on Twitter</a>,
where he asked whether the following code printed -6, 0, '&lt;nil&gt;', or
paniced:</p>

<blockquote><pre>package main
</pre>

<pre>import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

func f(ctx context.Context) {
    context.WithValue(ctx, "foo", -6)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    f(ctx)
    fmt.Println(ctx.Value("foo"))
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't answer this correctly because I focused my attention on the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>What I focused on was the use of the <code>"foo"</code> string as the context
key, partly because of my experience with languages like Python.
To start with, the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/context/"><code>context</code></a>
package's documentation says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string
or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using
context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A traditional problem in languages like Python is that two strings
may compare the same without actually being the same thing, and
some code really wants you to present it with the exact same thing.
However, the <code>context</code> package doesn't require that you present it
with the exact same key, just a key where the <em>interface value</em> of
the key will compare the same.</p>

<p>(Because <code>context</code> compares interface values, both the value and
the type must match; it's not enough for both values to have the
same underlying concrete type, say string, and to compare identical.
This is why defining your own string type is a reliable away around
collisions between packages.)</p>

<p>So after I worked through all of this, I confidently answered that
this code printed -6. The <code>"foo"</code> string that the value is set
with is not necessarily the same <code>"foo"</code> string that it's retrieved
with, but that doesn't matter. However, this is not the problem
with the code. The actual problem is that <strong>context.WithValue()
returns a new context with the value set, it doesn't change the
context it's called on</strong>. Dave Cheney's code is written as if
<code>.WithValue()</code> mutates the current context, as <code>f()</code> ignores that
new context that <code>.WithValue()</code> provides and returns nothing to
<code>main()</code>. Since the original <code>context</code> in <code>main()</code> is what <code>.Value()</code>
is called on, it has no <code>"foo"</code> key and the result is actually
'&lt;nil&gt;'.</p>

<p>This problem with the code is actually a quite interesting mistake,
because as far as I can tell right now none of the usual Go style
checkers detect it. This code passes '<code>go vet</code>', it produces no
complaints from <a href="https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck"><code>errcheck</code></a>
because we're not ignoring an error return value, and tools like
<a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint">golangci-lint</a> only
complain about the use of the built-in type string as the key in
<code>.WithValue()</code>. Nothing seems to notice that we're ignoring the
critical return value from <code>.WithValue()</code>, which turns it into more
or less a no-op.</p>

<p>(Now that Dave Cheney has brought this to the surface, I suspect
that someone will contribute a check for it to <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">staticcheck</a>, which already detects the 'using a
built-in type as a key' issue.)</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The impending ban or acquisition of TikTok and ByteDance’s lawsuit against the Trump administration have sucked up all the oxygen in the US-China tech zeitgeist. A gigantic IPO, possibly the largest in the world, by Ant Financials is also looming on the horizon. Consequently, one story with potentially much farther-reaching impact got buried.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/can-you-nationalize-open-source/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>That story is the Chinese <strong>Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)’s anointment of Gitee, a homegrown Git-based developer collaboration platform</strong>, as the domestic “national champion” to drive open source growth in China. It got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/china-is-building-its-github-alternative-gitee/">a blip on TechCrunch</a>, and I included the original announcement in <a href="https://interconnected.blog/august-23-2020-crypto-tiktok-jedi-zoom-pinduoduo-gitee/">last week’s Interconnected Weekly</a>. That's about it.</p><p>To understand why this development could have global significance, we need to first understand Gitee, MIIT’s role in China’s technology landscape, and open source’s own “gift culture” and global reach.</p><h2 id="what-is-gitee">What is Gitee?</h2><p>As readers of Interconnected know, I loathe the intellectually lazy comparisons that are common when talking about Chinese and American tech companies and try to avoid the “X is the [American company Y] of China” shorthand. Sure there has been plenty of cloning by Chinese companies of American success stories (and increasingly in the opposite direction), but both economies, cultures, and consumer behaviors are complex in their own ways and ought to be treated with nuance.</p><p>Sadly in Gitee’s case, this lazy framework happens to be rather accurate. It <em><strong>is</strong></em> the GitHub of China and nothing more.</p><h3 id="history-and-product">History and Product</h3><p>Gitee started in 2013 and was incubated out of OSChina, the country’s largest open source community website that started in 2008. OSChina owns Gitee, and even today the main contact email on Gitee’s homepage is a `oschina.cn` address. When Gitee started, GitHub (the current incumbent in the code repository hosting space) was a five-year-old Series A startup that was already gaining traction in various open source communities, especially the Ruby on Rails community.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6N1XUrxagJ6la-tzFEoV_NaWdvhTZVBRTv92bZyQ0_xLMGDMsxAqib3n8rayNQfMkh-Sl1PeeOgEwMEXrPMXWxo4InjRT2BVhWCyzkFIQYOqh37G7j5Uk0__RiED17zGbHhzsuOc" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3Qspqh0GLw_AMq91OZ0QpGq7ctsslMPJuDpvakrvJ4XromE2sylsm7M63lOckfZUZbudrbAReRyDC9LwbIalEIacpWLzannK1mc_hwj1ax4WaYC7ffNJsST_gSkIlMBx9aOYvHfr" alt=""></figure><p>If GitHub didn’t revamp it’s own UI <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-06-23-design-updates-to-repositories-and-github-ui/">just a couple of months ago</a>, the two platforms would’ve looked virtually identical, except for a different color scheme and one displaying many more Chinese characters than the other. (The degree of similarity reminds me a bit of RenRen and Facebook in the early days of social media in China.)</p><p>It’s not completely fair to say Gitee has done nothing new. It does have more social tools, like direct messaging, which GitHub does not support. It also has an embedded web-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment, aka text editor for developers) though it’s not clear how many developers use it in place of existing popular solutions, like VSCode or IntelliJ. GitHub continues to add new features at a rapid clip, even after the Microsoft acquisition, like GitHub Actions and <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/">Discussions (in beta)</a>, so it’ll take quite a few years before Gitee can reach feature parity, if ever.</p><p><em>(Before writing this post, I tried to sign up for a Gitee account to experience it fully as a developer, but got stumped by a bizarrely difficult captcha process that took me at least five tries without success. I didn’t know I was this bad at reading fuzzy letters. This level of friction and poor user experience would’ve made any developer balk and leave.)</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dyK5nkpTv83N7ExBAeILqTyjpv6mz0dXLOx2aPbl8lmoMTee1Ma6hUpGsof1ODJ5fCIGotLpokXWV0l4rbdqIVAMh_MetwhGVFzjkFRajv9i6QVFR__Xf3qvpXeGUmpVW8vDnbYl" alt=""></figure><h3 id="market-traction">Market Traction</h3><p>For the most part, Gitee is a typical venture-backed startup though it has not attracted much investment so far. In 2019, Gitee received a small strategic <a href="https://www.chinatechnews.com/2019/12/10/26287-oschina-gained-strategic-investment-from-baidu">investment from Baidu</a> and, in exchange, Baidu migrated some of its flagship open source projects, like its <a href="https://gitee.com/baidu/apolloauto">self-driving framework Apollo</a>, to Gitee to seed more adoption. It claims to be the 2nd largest code repository platform in the world. This claim is not that far-fetched considering that China-based developers’ activities on GitHub is the 2nd largest group by a wide margin. If you include Hong Kong-based developers with China, it may be the largest cohort, exceeding that of the United States. It’s likely that a solid proportion of Chinese developers have Gitee accounts, along with GitHub, which would justify Gitee’s 2nd place claim.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ynQ01jyNy-HDfVeglvZXazg4Jg5hbZmuaEJDjVDs18FrLpNTI-Hcx_gkcQFnPbT9uy5Rw1lGUFL3hZMZfW9D7YEzwo-89lwTjDxAtd9F1L81j5B6TftXKLB22I-9sQUMUbbzSoo" alt=""><figcaption>Source GitHub Octoverse 2019: https://octoverse.github.com/</figcaption></figure><p>From the business side, Gitee’s go-to-market approach is a classic enterprise strategy, which is, again, not that different from GitHub, GitLab, or other similar products. It counts Huawei, China Telecom, and a handful of banks as enterprise customers -- all companies with national strategic importance. With MIIT’s official endorsement, Gitee’s enterprise traction within China will grow. That also means it will have no traction outside of China, but doing business globally was never part of Gitee’s ambition, though that contradicts its claimed purpose to foster open source (more on that later).</p><p>When I was writing my 3-part series “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-players/"><strong>Open Source in China</strong></a>'' in May, I only briefly mentioned Gitee as one of the minor players in the ecosystem. MIIT’s anointment will boost Gitee’s profile and status, because it is now the designated “national champion”. There will be more government support for the platform. The company will get more investment from funds that like to align themselves closely with government initiatives. I can even see a day when Gitee will IPO on the Shanghai STAR exchange, similar to other much bigger “national champions”, like SMIC in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>There are still lots of unknowns to how Gitee will grow as a product. What is clear is that Gitee is <strong>now a “policy-driven” company </strong>that will rely heavily on the government direction-setting and protectionism, quite similar to its investor Baidu. While all current Chinese tech giants have benefited from some level of protectionism in the past, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and now ByteDance have all grown their core technologies and products to a level where they <em>can</em> compete with other global players on those terms alone. Not Baidu. And not Gitee.</p><h2 id="miit-s-role">MIIT’s Role</h2><p>MIIT is the most relevant central government ministry to pay attention to when it comes to China’s technology sector. It has embraced open source in an official policy planning document in 2016, titled: “2016-2020: Development Planning of Software and Information Technology Services Industry” (unofficial translation). This document laid out a few initiatives (more like proclamations) where open source was the centerpiece:</p><blockquote>“...promote the effect that the open source community has to support innovation, strengthen the real-world application of open source technology in innovation, build an open source ecosystem that is advantageous to innovation in an open, collaborative, and global fashion...” (unofficial translation)</blockquote><p>The endorsement of Gitee is the result of an official government project procurement in May that called for proposals of solutions for an “open source hosting platform”. <strong>This is perhaps the first step that MIIT took to concretely involve itself in open source.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A1Uco6q0-KGLps5UveY5NjqQwZWAKg73Y_oDF-P5VQslEbAhISsdTrv7VIZnA3kfj17ThFiCvSTT84R5L1UZWSYzr9dzNbGk3PCIEbxwvwWx5NaL5JCFQCZifoZnur8WjF049Q-H" alt=""><figcaption>MIIT official project procurement announcement</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the group that won the project was a consortium of 10 organizations that included: Huawei, a few technical universities and think tanks, a few other companies, and, of course, OSChina. Thus Gitee.</p><p><strong>Why did Gitee win? It’s really the only game in town.</strong> I highly doubt GitHub or GitLab submitted a proposal.</p><p>If MIIT was simply interested in embracing open source and lending its support to Chinese open source developers where they are working and collaborating now, GitHub would’ve been the obvious choice. On Zhihu, a Quora-like service in China where many developers congregate to discuss technology topics (thus a good proxy for assessing interest level), <strong>more than 84,000 people follow GitHub. Gitee? 243</strong> (at the time of this writing).</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QVwEbCc5rDm81FVyJuqIqRlycRfAzwSzi2nJcz5lJiZTPNfHxkU4Hy_1AH7aERIVM5RHtVaLql7GRdKen0rle5HjDiZxeiPVY4XUIrAoZ8AHm0bmfU5HvgiR8WIJRAg-Fy4uEXCU" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BEgC9nm1LSdYZp0EiUgkBsC6wyXjl31tQx-00O45iojWB2UCEe3Sb7eehtF4c5k1UFe7m5UWbPHEFlpuR9eslPp0RlQMQOzQQjoWIvwjGgScjaG0XaJFDhFoHoHsXOyIlhPhaHI8" alt=""></figure><h3 id="how-will-all-this-play-out">How will all this play out?</h3><p>There are not enough details to speculate. As the current four-year planning period ended in 2020, MIIT is likely working on the next four years of planning, where Gitee will play a significant role.</p><p>However, it is likely that any open source project that MIIT or its various sub-bureaus will use in the future will have to be hosted on Gitee. If the project is already on GitHub, the company or team that runs the project will probably have to maintain another copy on Gitee. This requirement may extend to many of the strategic tech sectors that are under MIIT’s jurisdiction.</p><p>All this is done to exert some level of national “control” on the open source technologies that are important to China’s path towards self-reliance, just in case GitHub becomes inaccessible due to more sanctions or policy changes from Washington.</p><p><strong>This fear is not unwarranted. </strong>Right now, GitHub is accessible albeit with performance issues here and there, but no one can guarantee that will continue in this current environment between the US and China. Being a subsidiary of Microsoft, GitHub may also be caught up in the potential Microsoft-TikTok deal in ways that no one can predict.</p><p>There’s a lot to untangle, and the future is murky. Thus, some contingency planning is quite reasonable.</p><p>But is this attempt to “nationalize” open source in China going to work?</p><h2 id="open-source-can-t-be-nationalized-">Open Source Can’t Be “Nationalized”</h2><p>As you might’ve guessed by now, the title of the post is a rhetorical question. You can’t “nationalize” open source.</p><p>But the bigger point is: <strong>it’s dangerous to think you can.</strong></p><p>It’s smart for a government to embrace the innovative energy of open source to boost its own technological advancement. China is doing it. I’ve advocated <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/"><strong>in this Wired opinion piece</strong></a><strong> </strong>that the U.S. should be doing the same.</p><p>But no government can or should try to “nationalize” open source, because it contradicts the very nature and culture of open source that made it the technological force that it is today.</p><p><strong>Eric Raymond</strong>, one of the founding members of the free software and open source movement, wrote a profound essay called “<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s06.html"><strong>The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture</strong></a>” in the 90s.

It includes a whole spectrum of conditions, from tendonitis of the hand or wrist to carpal tunnel syndrome to cubital tunnel syndrome. Basically, if your hands or wrists hurt or go numb or tingle, that may be RSI. If these symptoms are associated with repetitive tasks, such as typing at a computer, it is almost certainly RSI. (Note that such symptoms do sometimes go away within a few minutes, hours, days, or weeks.) Other symptoms include losing strength or coordination in your hands, or perhaps dropping things.</p> <p>Not everyone experiences all symptoms, and sometimes your symptoms may not occur until several hours or even days after the activity which causes them. (Have you ever hiked a long way and not been really sore until the next day or even two days later?) Some people, especially at UHS, call RSIs Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs); it's the same thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>RSI seems to have many causes. Everyone's RSI is different. The cause can be equipment, but contributing factors can be broader (overall body health like sleep/head/neck/back posture factors, psychological factors). Sometimes you might have RSI symptoms, but it might actually NOT be RSI!</li> <li>Pronating wrists (turning face down) is bad - therefore the default mouse and keyboard alignment is bad! 😱</li> <li>Tilting wrists up is bad - the normal up-sloping keyboard is bad. It should be exactly the opposite: <img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/85174576-31ebac80-b2a8-11ea-913d-5efdfc4fb9e7.png"> </li> <li>Arm posture/lumbar/upper back support is important.</li> <li>Constant pressure in one position is a cause - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4482445">vary it up</a> and take frequent breaks</li> <li>Long key travel (up/down) is bad.</li> <li>Long key travel (sideways) is bad therefore QWERTY is bad.</li> <li>Multiple pressure at the same time is bad, therefore Ctrl+C/S/V with one hand is bad.</li> <li>Sometimes the cause is <strong>psychosomatic</strong> - subconscious stress.</li> <li>Exercise helps sometimes - pushups, pullups, dips, and situps. Not too much, though. Sleep too. But it doesn't always fix RSI.</li> <li>It is never "cured", just managed. Know what triggers your RSI.</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2 id="basiccheap-recommendations">Basic/Cheap Recommendations</h2> <ul> <li> <p>Don't use default Apple laptop keyboard</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/keyboards/37648/the-best-ergonomic-keyboards-for-2020">Split Keyboards?</a>?

Preface
</summary>

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a> engage in the human greeting protocol.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

</figure>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

if every node has a direct link to every other node:</p>

  <figcaption>
A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something I’ve noticed this weekend is that a lot of my technological choices are tending towards simplicity. Here’s a quick summary of where I’m at with things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system: <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a></li>
<li>Desktop environment / window manager: <a href="https://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a></li>
<li>IDE / text editor: <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a></li>
<li>Preferred programming language: <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a></li>
<li>Browser: <a href="https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb">vimb</a></li>
<li>Music player: <a href="https://github.com/boysetsfrog/vimpc">vimpc</a> w/ <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">mpd</a> backend</li>
<li>Email client: <a href="https://aerc-mail.org/">aerc</a></li>
<li>Managed <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles">dotfiles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It might not be immediately obvious what about this is “simple”…</p>
<p>Running Arch requires some upfront effort to familiarise with Linux to a greater extent than you’ve likely ever done prior.</p>
<p>xmonad is configured in Haskell.</p>
<p>Neovim requires a lot more effort than something like VSCode if you want LSP integration, which as a professional software engineer I consider a must.</p>
<p>Haskell is a notoriously difficult language with an emphasis on correctness.</p>
<p>vimb - a web browser - doesn’t support tabs.</p>
<p>My music player is split between a client and a server on the same machine.</p>
<p>My email client isn’t a Gmail tab!</p>
<p>And to make all of this viable I have to track everything in a dotfiles repo.</p>
<p>But it is genuinely the simplest setup I’ve ever had, having spent long periods of time with Windows, macOS, and various flavours of Linux. In fact, I still dual boot with Windows for VR and am forced to run macOS on my work machine, so it’s not as if I’m out of the loop on alternative technological lifestyles.</p>
<p>I think the common thread that ties these together is that <em>less is more</em>, analagous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>. Alternative operating systems are very easy to get started with, but I think everyone has had the experience of things going so wrong that your only recourse was to reinstall the whole thing. In my experience, large updates (as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a>) are more likely to break things, and when they do it’s much harder to debug and fix, not only because there are more changes to sift through but also because these operating systems tend to treat the user like an idiot who shouldn’t be allowed to see beyond the facade of a shiny UI. They’re not wrong to do so, most people don’t spend as long as their computer as me; I’m certainly thankful when, say, DIY products are designed with novices like me in mind. The consequence however is that it does leave power users out in the cold, and all too often threads on Microsoft or Apple’s forums about obscure issues will be met with little more than “try a reinstall”.</p>
<p>I can see a parallel between that and my increasing fondness of Haskell, too, and to a lesser extent Rust. These languages emphasise correctness. They don’t make many compromises in the name of getting new users up and running faster, and experienced users benefit long-term. This contrasts sharply with my experience with JavaScript, a language too simple for its own good. You need only look at the meteoric rise of TypeScript to see that experienced developers have been clamouring for something more reliable than “I hope this property is here like I’m expecting it to be”. Even TypeScript, though, is like lipstick on a pig; compromises have been made to ensure that all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript, and that TypeScript has no runtime presence. This results in a language which is misleadingly unsafe if you’re not very careful to manage the unsafety at the edges of your application, and aren’t very vigilant to the many JavaScriptian flaws permeating the type system.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story with everything else I listed and everything I’ve omitted to mention. I don’t want a clunky web UI or walled garden for playing music. I don’t even want a native music player that manages everything for me, because that needlessly ties my playlists et al to my preferred interface, making migration a pain. And why would I want browser tabs when my window manager handles it natively far, far better?</p>
<p>Granted, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. It takes time to set new things up. If I wanted to install a camera into my desktop tomorrow, I’m not confident it’d work out of the box. I’d have to research it a bit ahead of time, and expect to spend maybe 15 minutes or so setting it up. But if this is the cost of, after that initial setup, everything <em>just working</em>, then that’s a worthwhile time investment to me.</p>
<p>As for what prompted this blog post, I rewrote <a href="https://samhh.com/">samhh.com</a> this weekend to host my blog posts, inspired by some posts from <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">sircmpwn</a> on the creeping centralisation of everything on the web. During development I noticed that I’d previously set it up such that any 404 was redirected to the homepage. A simple question arose: What benefit does this provide? It takes power away from the user. They can no longer see the URL they were trying to get to, and if they wanted my homepage they could always get there with ease anyway. So why do it? I’ve since removed that redirect and replaced it with a simple <a href="https://www.samhh.com/404">404 page</a>.</p>
<p>(Not sponsored, just happy with it.) I feel compelled to shoutout <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby">Gatsby</a> here. I first set it up a couple of years ago and it’s still really easy to work with for anyone who already works with React at their day job. It produces static sites that can be deployed virtually anywhere without devoting any time to devops. My site is currently hosted by Netlify, but I’m not locked in at all in terms of the project’s structure, which I think tangentially ties into the above themes.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <p>My entire worldview changed when I realized that <strong>luck can be created</strong>.</p> <p>More precisely, you can actively <strong>create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you</strong>. The more I looked into this, the more I realized that this is not only <em>not</em> a new insight, but successful people have studied this for <em>decades</em> and I am just late to the party.</p> <p>In this post we'll briefly review the "Literature of Luck", and then I'll end with some personal thoughts on how it could be extended.</p> <section> <h2 id="binary-luck">Binary Luck</h2> <p>Most people have a binary view of luck:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kgd335km9x3ujfmhxnz7.png"> </p> <p>This is true enough. Some people are born into privilege, some people just win some literal or figurative lottery or other.</p> <p>The closing question of every episode of Guy Raz's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a> podcast asks successful people: <em>"How much of your success is due to skill, and how much is due to luck?"</em></p> <p>Those who believe in their own agency answer the former. Others - who've seen people smarter and harder working than them fail - answer the latter. Those who are politically correct cop-out with the half-and-half.</p> <p>It can be comforting to subscribe to the binary luck model. If you just got a bad roll of the dice, there's nothing you could do. Your lack of success is not your fault.</p> <p>But what if I told you <strong>there are people who have skill at creating luck</strong> for themselves?</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</h2> <p>Jason Roberts coined the term "<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a>", and it was expanded by <a href="https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2019/04/03/increase-your-luck-surface-area-to-get-more-customers/">Sean Murphy</a> and popularized by <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Patrick McKenzie</a>.</p> <p>I liken this model of luckiness to a "catchment area" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchment_area">a term from urban and hydrological geography</a>). Luck is still randomly occurring, but you can position yourself in a way that captures more of it:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogbkk8weenqb9nltrl34.png"> </p> <p>Jason has a really simple model of how to grow your LSA - do more things, and tell more people about it. <strong>Doing and Telling</strong>. Already this embodies a more active attitude toward how you can orient your life for more positive random events. It's "<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>" adapted for luck.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="four-kinds-of-luck">Four Kinds of Luck</h2> <p>A parallel, older school of thought dates back to James Austin in 1978 and was repopularized by <a href="https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html">Marc Andreesen</a> in 2007, then <a href="https://twitter.com/nivi/status/1094940675353784320?lang=en">Naval and Nivi</a> a decade later.</p> <p>Here, there are no helpful visuals. James Austin just gives a list of types, and Marc quotes verbatim. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1093981014920052736">Naval summarizes</a> the 4 kinds of luck as such:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li> <p>Hope luck finds you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hustle until you stumble into it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.</p> </li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>I've quoted this many times to friends and always had trouble remembering what the 4 types are. I gave it some thought and visualized/organized it as such:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5ycsicfgoxsvxoyys5ip.png"> </p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>🌱 Accidental Luck</strong>: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it's seed lands. It's not very interesting since by definition you can't do anything about it, but ofc privilege plays a huge part.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck</strong>: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There's no particular direction in mind, but you're more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope. You're more likely to roll a 6 if you roll more dice.</p> <blockquote> <p>"I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down." - <a href="https://due.com/blog/keep-going-charles-f-kettering/">Charles Kettering</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>💊 Prepared Luck</strong>: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident (some mold happened to fall in the right spot + Fleming happened to see it + he had a similar experience that was a nonevent 9 years ago), but Fleming was not only "uniquely equipped to observe it" by his background, he took action to confirm the observation.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." - Seneca</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”" - <a href="http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/">Gian-Carlo Rota</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>🧲 Magnetic Luck</strong>: <em>"Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave."</em> All sources call it "individualized action" but I've renamed it "magnetic luck" to emphasize the end result rather than how you get there. I'm quite familiar with this as <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/#miner">the "Miner" gear of my Learning Gears</a> terminology (since updated to 4 gears in <a href="https://learninpublic.org/">my book</a>). This was already a thing pre-Internet, but search and social media have given tremendous reach and influence to the oddballs and obsessives that become the spiritual leaders of every idea and purpose both big and niche.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I find the 4 of these hard to remember, so I've organized them along two axes - <strong>active vs passive</strong>, and <strong>general vs individual</strong>. The first axis is the same realization as "Luck Surface Area" - you actually have the power to do things to create more luck than you were given.</p> <p>The second axis is the insight - that there are forms of luck that apply to everyone, and there are forms of luck that are available only to someone in your unique position. There is a you-shaped hole in the universe and you can either passively occupy it or you can become a beacon for some idea or purpose.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="habits-and-strategy">Habits and Strategy</h2> <p>I of course find the Four Kinds of Luck very appealing, since I've quoted it so much to friends that I'm writing this post at all. But upon closer reading I think there's a <em>slightly</em> different direction that is unaddressed by the Four Kinds (I originally thought this was embedded in the Four Kinds, only to discover that it wasn't in the source material and I had completely read my own thinking into it).</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/poue5zg9homy1eo4ml05.png"> </p> <p>This model differs in two ways. It treats both axes as a spectrum rather than a 2x2. It also focuses more on <strong>actions</strong> (you can take) rather than <strong>classification</strong> (which are a little more abstract). I've also swapped out "Active vs Passive" for "Active Habits" and "Individual vs General" for "Good Strategy". So my version is more about HOW you get more lucky. It's not very actionable to be "more magnetic", but you can Claim a Domain or Hustle and have a good sense of what those things entail.</p> <p>I've written about a few of these ideas in prior posts so I won't elaborate:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">Claiming a Domain, Personal Branding</a></li> <li>"Copywork" I wrote about in the "Clone Open Source Apps" chapter of the book</li> </ul> <p>I think <strong>Exploring</strong> and <strong>Prospecting</strong> are worth elaborating here.</p> <p><strong>Exploring</strong> (and to a lesser extent Grinding and Copywork) are <strong>Actively Habitual, non Strategic</strong> activities. But this doesn't mean it is bad. I think this is what you do when you take in general life and career advice and apply them to yourself. You know there are a list of <strong>Principles</strong> which are just generally good things to do in life, and trust that you will do well if you do those things (e.g. <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>). Keep doing the "right" things, and "trust the process".</p> <p><strong>Prospecting</strong> is a term I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting">borrowed from the oil exploration industry</a>. <strong>Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.</strong> These days, when you look for oil, there is a whole science to handicapping whether or not a plot of land is likely to have oil. You don't know it for a fact, all you're doing is estimating probabilities. Not to get too tautological, but you will be luckier if you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be "lucky". It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random. I've also written many times about how I think strategic <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22&amp;oq=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22">manoeuvring for "Megatrends"</a> is a good idea.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5075sq79y4pstxpp4pdk.png"> </p> <p>This is the state of my thinking on luck right now. That last bit you just read is pretty fresh, I might come back and change this in a couple years when I have refined my thoughts. I welcome any and all feedback.</p> <p>But overall, the message I really want to leave you with is this: <strong>you can create luck</strong>. That's it. I don't care how you do it, what mental model you use, who you quote. I just care <em>that</em> you do it. <strong>Go make yourself more lucky.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Ordinarily I'd wish you good luck, but now you have something better than a mere wish 😂</p> </blockquote> </section> <hr>  </div> </main>  </div></div></div>]]>

<h4><em>The Civil Infrastructure Platform has several work groups that ensure things keep running. Below is a Q and A with the CIP Kernel Team.&nbsp;</em></h4>



<h4><strong>1. What is CIP Kernel Team (What does this team work on, what issues does it solve)</strong></h4>



<p>While the CIP project aims to establish an open source base layer (OSBL) of industrial grade software to enable the use and implementation of software building blocks for civil infrastructure, CIP Kernel Team is responsible for Linux kernel in OSBL to sustain industrial grade systems or devices during their life cycles.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fe5AeUVhO7PWJxM2UZPVieCttQPS0w43QU0VjEZeeT7DZdBXJaeeAv96GegIpavWucZDLnn4y1M-EuuHWHCPxeoIFzMfSCohjbLI4nOlA5vU0mRzvl-l_HKZa99fPnhYx_8X0dOb" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>2. What is the primary goal of this team?</strong></h4>



<p>The goal of the team is to provide CIP kernels with more than a ten year maintenance period by fixing versions to fulfill the required level of reliability, sustainability, and security.</p>



<h4><strong>3. What is the development principle of CIP?</strong></h4>



<p>CIP adopts the upstream first as our development principle. The “Upstream First” principle allows patch commits only if those patches are already in the upstream. By following this principle, if a desired patch is not in the upstream yet, this patch should be accepted by the upstream at first. Therefore, it may take time to introduce the desired patch to our project.</p>



<p>But, it enables us to share our outputs with the upstream.&nbsp; At the same time, the risk of conflicts can be eliminated.</p>



<p>CIP is aiming to sustain target systems and devices during their life cycles which are very long by their nature. So the Upstream First principle is essential to achieve our goal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FTuEv57sb4x25OHLDFmIjrPpsujBx75lTDzEWqKtZfAh7jd6hbWtV2YfKOtA_lehxcH0GfeXLhYwYfzwBX2dGvUrPwAi0CYaJf-yfGwLlLY1-8zFfbfCM8OL5zJBG1ndhz8kaWHJ" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>4. What is “Upstream First” for the Kernel Team?</strong></h4>



<p>For the CIP kernel team, upstreams are Linus mainline and LTS. The team collaborates with upstream projects. Before using their outputs, the team upstreams what the team has and doesn’t keep them locally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fBd2bEkTS7ESz8wugA2jGFrOH_I5DcIhDTzRsWuvWQlKL9nMyt-rNJqwCpNci5GPiJKm34vguEz8MVGlUtU_TxQ8YBEym78alWC8dRuoz_hpCeMcri5VarFmLCKq_L4gqcaBxyoP" alt=""></figure>



<p>As marked 1, “Contribution” is our first action. Feature upstreaming is done by CIP member developers. On the other hand, the CIP Kernel Team contributes to upstream in a more general manner. The team developed open source tools in order to work on contributions effectively..</p>



<p>As marked 2, “Use” is the second action. The team uses LTS kernels to release CIP SLTS kernels. For those releases, automated testing plays a very important role. Therefore the&nbsp; CIP kernel team is closely working with the CIP testing team.</p>



<p>As marked 3, “Integrate” is the third action. By integrating those SLTS kernels with CIP Core packages and additional packages, industrial systems or devices can be developed and maintained.</p>



<h4><strong>5. How does the team use LTS kernels?</strong></h4>



<p>The team uses LTS for CIP SLTS kernel bases.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="330" src="https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-1024x330.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-1024x330.png 1024w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-200x65.png 200w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM-768x248.png 768w, https://www.cip-project.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-18-at-5.32.16-AM.png 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>CIP SLTS kernels are based on LTS 4.4 and 4.19. The first releases of SLTS 4.19 and 4.19rt were done in 2019. The team plans to maintain them until 2029 for ten years. The first releases of SLTS 4.4 and 4.4rt were done in 2017, and likewise the team supports them for ten years till 2027.</p>



<p>Both LTS 4.4 and 4.19 are maintained for 6 years by the LTS project. So, the remaining 4 years will be maintained by the CIP Kernel Team.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vAlgfS_UAjTAwDZpkk6P0GzwpyGS8e6bIljcNqEdqogvIWlHl9dRWyq5iUE2gwZ7FU0APVhbD43AmTaJJGR3erW2PzhSc06-2c0HIa22NoEWv16aMB8zpQN7WdSaREycN50r04NX" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>6. How can CIP kernels be used?</strong></h4>



<p>By integrating the SLTS kernels with CIP Core packages and additional packages, industrial systems or devices can be developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIP refers to Debian for userland packages. If you would like to use Debian source packages, you can use Yocto/Poky as a build system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIP core packages contain tens of packages which may not be sufficient for the development of end products. So, you can add necessary packages from Debian by writing recipes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kS4fbRYqo8H8F6uqIW7AG8NvIoytWhrktJI1ImmHZe0RJe2-igm13JMx_B21YNsKahjDQloBhvgwq26hs6m7LQ5191xLGEuj0z3MEngiU1Bd8lKVfjOlfymMG7ucnMOh94uS6jk_" alt=""></figure>



<h4><strong>7. What has this team accomplished so far?</strong></h4>



<p>Currently SLTS 4.19 is released twice a month and 4.4 is once a month. SLTS 4.19-rt is once a month and 4.4-rt once every two months.</p>



<p>So far the team has steadily released CIP SLTS kernels by following release frequencies below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6RCuQ3kVM8YPyMS8VAEca6BvrpOaRatTuvVtrzjK7aZkMXebRPk3HttFO1_C3I5NvNlXQbulBUQRjPVQNya_AfslpvJv0amsLHOQ4mSsHoLkAtNLEecD_mn0qMKxGFcQDqUGNU1D" alt=""></figure>



<p>(as of June 7, 2020)</p>



<h4><strong>8. What are some future goals?</strong></h4>



<p>The team made major releases in 2017 and 2019. So, a major release frequency is once per two years so far. Another two years is going to pass, and Year 2021 is approaching. So, the team started to discuss new SLTS kernels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>9. How can people get involved?</strong></h4>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i48b5q/for_those_that_work_for_a_team_that_has_both_data/" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> on the different roles in data science and machine learning: data scientist, decision scientist, product data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, machine learning tooling engineer, AI architect, etc.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>. Here, I’ll discuss the <a href="#from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">benefits</a> and <a href="#but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">counter-arguments</a>, <a href="#the-best-way-to-pick-it-up-is-via-learning-by-doing">how to</a> become end-to-end, and the experiences of <a href="#end-to-end-in-stitch-fix-and-netflix">Stitch Fix and Netflix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">From start (identify the problem) to finish (solve it)</h2>

<p>You may have come across similar <em>labels</em> and definitions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c" target="_blank">Generalist</a>: Focused on roles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager" target="_blank">PM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst" target="_blank">BA</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition/" target="_blank">DE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_scientists" target="_blank">DS</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-a-machine-learning-engineer-do" target="_blank">MLE</a>); some negative connotation</li>
  <li><a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">Full-stack</a>: Focused on tech (Spark, Torch, Docker); popularized by full-stack devs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429185/stop-searching-for-that-data-science-unicorn.html" target="_blank">Unicorn</a>: Focused on mythology; believed not to exist</li>
</ul>

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="what-is-wgpu"><a href="#what-is-wgpu">#</a> What is wgpu?</h2> <p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wgpu</a> is a Rust implementation of the <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU API spec</a>. WebGPU is a specification published by the GPU for the Web Community Group. It aims to allow web code access to GPU functions in a safe and reliable manner. It does this by mimicking the Vulkan API, and translating that down to whatever API the host hardware is using (ie. DirectX, Metal, Vulkan).</p> <p>Wgpu is still in development, so some of this doc is subject to change.</p> <h2 id="why-rust"><a href="#why-rust">#</a> Why Rust?</h2> <p>Wgpu actually has C bindings to allow you to write C/C++ code with it, as well as use other languages that interface with C. That being said, wgpu is written in Rust, and it has some convient Rust Bindings that don't have to jump through any hoops. On top of that, I've been enjoying writing in Rust.</p> <p>You should be fairly familiar with Rust before using this tutorial as I won't go into much detail on Rust syntax. If you're not super comfortable with Rust you can review the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust tutorial</a>. You should also be familiar about <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cargo</a>.</p> <p>I'm using this project as a way to learn wgpu myself, so I might miss some important details, or explain things wrong. I'm always open to constructive feedback. That being said, let's get started!</p></div><div><!----> <p><span>Last Updated: </span> <span>11/12/2019, 11:52:09 PM</span></p></div></div>]]>

While machine learning (ML) algorithms become increasingly powerful and ML frameworks are more and more mature, there are still significant barriers for introducing ML in many businesses. This course therefore does not focus on the technical aspects of ML but rather on the business challenges: Why should ML be introduced? Which use cases can benefit from ML models? How can ML be used responsibly as far as privacy and information security are concerned? And how can traditional businesses be transformed by leaning into ML?</p><h3><span id="How_to_Register_for_a_Free_Certificate"></span>How to Register for a Free Certificate<span></span></h3><p>While most courses on Coursera can be audited for free, you usually do not get a certificate of completion. Such certificates can be added to your CV, your LinkedIn profile or your portfolio and show potential colleagues and employers that you actually finished your course.</p><p>For this particular course, Coursera is giving away free certificates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You can register for your free certificate by visiting the following link: <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/machine-learning-business-professionals-13415">https://www.classcentral.com/course/machine-learning-business-professionals-13415</a></p><p>Then follow the “Go to class” link and log into your Coursera account. When you check out, the price for the certificate should be reduced to 0,00$.</p><h3><span id="Course_Review"></span>Course Review<span></span></h3><p>Free courses are always a good thing, but is this particular course really worth your time? In the following paragraphs, I will summarise my key insights.</p><p>The course is separated into four modules and is taught by different instructors from Google Cloud, all of which are very enjoyable to listen to.</p><h4><span id="Module_1_ML_Use_Cases_and_Chat_Bots"></span>Module 1: ML Use Cases and Chat Bots<span></span></h4><p>The first module gives a general introduction to the business aspects of machine learning. It deals with characteristics of data sets, introduces terminology (Artificial Intelligence versus Machine Learning) and presents a few common use cases where machine learning can be used in typical business environments.</p><p>In the courses first of three hands-on labs, you are given access to a project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and build a chat bot using DialogFlow. In this example, your customer’s goal is to order a pizza of a certain size with one or more toppings at a certain date and time. You learn how to automatically identify parts of the sentences and ask for the remaining pieces of information. When I completed the assignment, this was a typical dialog with the chat bot:</p><p>Bot: Hello! How can I help you?</p><p>Me: Order a large pizza</p><p>Bot: What day do you want to pick up your pizza?</p><p>Me: Today</p><p>Bot: What time do you want to pick up your pizza?</p><p>Me: 4 pm</p><p>Bot: What toppings do you want on your pizza?</p><p>Me: Salami, jalapenos</p><p>Bot: We have placed your order for a large pizza with salami, hot peppers, for pickup on 2020-08-30 at 04:00 pm. See you then!</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="1176" height="668" src="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals.png" srcset="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals.png 1176w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-300x170.png 300w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1024x582.png 1024w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-768x436.png 768w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-700x398.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px" data-old-src="//knasmueller.net/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals.png" data-srcset="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals.png 1176w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-300x170.png 300w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1024x582.png 1024w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-768x436.png 768w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-700x398.png 700w"></p><h4><span id="Module_2_Labeling_Data_and_Biases"></span>Module 2: Labeling Data and Biases<span></span></h4><p>The whole module two is dedicated to a tremendously important aspect: data quality and biases. While this may not be obvious to everyone, the outcome of a ML model depends much more on the data quality than on the algorithm (often, simple algorithms such as decision trees even give superior results to fancy new algorithms that were tailored to a very specific problem).</p><p>While the technical aspects of this module (such as training/test set evaluation, statistical biases, …) were not new to me, I really enjoyed how they connected these concepts to practical examples in real-world use cases.</p><p>The second big concept of this module was biases. They pointed out some interesting cases where racial, sexual and other kinds of discriminations found their way into machine learning models – even though the ML engineers tried to avoid that. In a concrete example, they showed a model where a gender bias was introduced in a model although the model did not contain the person’s gender as an attribute. Instead, the bias was introduced because the model&nbsp;<em>did</em> contain the person’s occupation, and the model was able to learn that some occupations are statistically more typically associated with females (e.g., receptionist, housekeeper) while others are more typically male (e.g., janitor, plumber):</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="799" height="475" src="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1.png" srcset="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1.png 799w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1-300x178.png 300w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1-768x457.png 768w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1-700x416.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" data-old-src="//knasmueller.net/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1.png" data-srcset="https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1.png 799w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1-300x178.png 300w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1-768x457.png 768w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-into-Earn-a-Free-Certificate-from-Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-for-Business-Professionals-1-700x416.png 700w"></p><h4><span id="Module_3_Discovering_ML_Use_Cases"></span>Module 3: Discovering ML Use Cases<span></span></h4><p>This module felt the most relevant to me since I was already very familiar with the statistical and technical aspects but not the business aspects of ML. In this module, concrete use cases for ML in various business environments and their solutions were presented. I really appreciated how these use cases were not made up but related to real customers of the Google Cloud team.</p><p>One recurring theme of those use cases was personalisation. Today, customers expect personalised instead of mass-produced content. While in the past, a TV station would hire data analysts to optimise the TV schedule of a newly produced series (“we should send it at 9 pm because this was historically a good time for romantic comedies”), such recommendations must now be made thousands and million times per day, for each individual user (“should I recommend a new season of her favourite cartoon or this crime movie based on her past viewing history?”). Without ML, it is impossible to make such personalised recommendations.</p><h4><span id="Module_4_Data_Strategies_and_ML_Teams"></span>Module 4: Data Strategies and ML Teams<span></span></h4><p>The last module was the most business-focused one. They introduced the idea of a&nbsp;<em>data strategy</em>, where multiple teams and departments in a business need to collaborate to increase the available amount of high quality data sets. “Design your systems so that you will have more data next year” – this advice is definitely true and a good foundation for future ML endeavours.</p><p>The instructors also suggest relying on agile principles when introducing ML methodologies: do not aim for models with 100% accuracy and do not spend too much time on perfecting individual models. Most of the time, you get 80% of the business value with 20% of the effort (the famous Pareto principle). I find this to be true in so many areas of life that it is also true for ML.</p><p>Finally, the module finishes with the topic of ML teams. They argue that most companies do not actually need that much <strong>ML engineers</strong> (creating and maintaining the actual models) but rather a considerable number of <strong>data engineers</strong> (ingesting and transforming data) and <strong>data analysts</strong> (collecting, curating and exploring data).</p><h3><span id="Final_Thoughts"></span>Final Thoughts<span></span></h3><p>In my opinion, it really helps if you already have a background on the technical aspects of ML (they are largely ignored or taken for granted in this course). However, due to the instructors’ real-world experience, there is very much one can learn about the business aspects of ML and I would highly recommend taking it. The lab exercises are rather sequential (“Do A, then do B, then click on export, …”) but you get a good overview of the most important functions in GCP.</p><p>Although there is a lot more to learn on the subject of ML, the course is a very good introduction that pretty much all engineering managers and CTOs would benefit from.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This guide covers timeless ideas that are helpful to keep in mind while working with
systems where performance matters. Many of these ideas are fairly “durable”
and will apply regardless of what hardware, programming language, operating
system, or decade you are working in.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for follow-up articles that will drill into hardware and
more Rust-specific techniques.</p>

<p>Skip to the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> if you don’t like intros.</p>

<p>There’s some foul language in here. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast</li>
  <li>only do things that are necessary for correctness and safety</li>
  <li>your engineers will burn out, leave your team, and relentlessly shit talk you
if they don’t make their code pretty and low-friction to work with</li>
  <li>align all latency-throughput queuing positions for everything in the
serial dependency graph, or you will get worst-of-all-worlds
latency-throughput behavior, increasing latency and lowering throughput</li>
  <li>if something necessary can be done in the background without blocking,
queue it up for eventual batch processing to improve cache performance</li>
  <li>look at allocation lifetime using DHAT, avoid short-lived allocations
and ensure that long-lived allocations employ time-space trade-offs
that consume plentiful resources instead of scarce ones where possible</li>
  <li>seriously, it’s always your fault if your engineers quit.</li>
  <li>performance happens naturally when engineers love the codebase and they
are aware of which parts of the system can be sped up</li>
  <li>before wasting time optimizing things that don’t matter, we can easily test
whether optimizing could be useful at all by adding delays or deleting
relevant code to see what the impact of infinite optimization would be</li>
  <li>by default your machine will randomly change your cpu frequency, yank
processes across cores and sockets, and generally make measurements
deceptive and non-reproducible. we can control this behavior. if you
don’t account for this behavior, your measurements are not sound justifications
for code changes</li>
  <li>wait, why does an executive care about performance, anyway?</li>

<p>Ok, now that the executives are gone, it is time to party.</p>

<p>Let’s put on some nice music.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Let it out.</p>

<p>The year is 2020. and we are utterly fucked.</p>

<p>Supposedly we are here reading this article because we “like computers” or
something but let’s be clear about one thing - you’re not here because of that.
I know. You know. We all know. You couldn’t give two fried pennies about
computers if they didn’t help you feel the things you so desperately need to
feel.</p>

<p>You’re here, ultimately, because of control. Your entire life is entombed
in an elaborate, entirely abstract labyrinth of machines that define so
many aspects of every moment of your waking life. You’re here to better
understand the prison you find yourself within. You’re here to sympathize
with the machine.</p>

<p>While you will only seep ever more deeply into this morass of gold and glass,
you have the power to turn your captors into familiar friends. You have the
power to make the machines into the only friends you will ever need. You are
here to abandon the organic and the analogue. There is nothing for you on the
other side of your window. As you lounge (please fix your posture now) in your
designated quarantine pit, gazing listlessly into the LED mesh while biding
your time, I invite you to join me - your newest simulated human experience -
on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure into the bowels of the machine through which
you experience joy and place orders for more toilet paper.</p>

<p>It begins today.</p>

<p><img src="http://sled.rs/art/sunrise.jpg" alt="warm sun rising over the water with a boat and mountains in the background"></p>

<p>This guide contains basic information for getting started with
performance-sensitive engineering. I think most folks will learn something new.
I know I have. And, part of why I wrote this is to have a single place with a
memorable URL where I can return to when I forget most of this stuff. More
importantly, when I unfurl fiery screeds in random internet comments I want to
have an intimidating reference to which I can mercilesly link.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this guide for the Rust ecosystem, where many people are now
trying their hands at optimization for the first time. But nearly all of this document
applies to general programming, with a few of the hardware effects mentioned
being specific to x86 and ARM circa 2020. Linux is assumed, because that’s
what the overwhelming majority of server workloads run today.</p>

<p>This guide brings together ideas from systems engineering, systems theory,
psychology, hardware, queuing theory, statistics, economics,
distributed systems, concurrency and philosophy of science with the goals of
helping you to be less of an asshole and write code that tends to improve
the metrics you care about.</p>

<p>Performance is about being thoughtful about the metrics that matter to us and
allowing ourselves to be aware of them while making decisions.</p>

<p>These materials are based on Tyler Neely’s Rust workshop content, and have been
inspired by the writings of

<h2 id="principles">principles</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose
reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive biases.

You just are cognitive biases.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Rationality-An-Introduction">- Luke Muehlhauser, via R:AZ</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is that our minds are pure shit and everything we
know is wrong. We must accept our fallibility before embarking down the path to
fast-as-fuck machinery.</p>

<p>We build towers of assumptions that are bound to specific contexts, and when the
conditions that caused us to form these beliefs change, we tend not to revisit
the now-invalidated beliefs. Cache invalidation is hard when we are so rarely
aware of the dependency graphs of what we believe.</p>

<p>So, we measure. Even when we’re convinced that we’re right. Because we are
always out of sync with reality, and we are fundamentally incapable of altering
this fact. But we can be responsible in the face of that.</p>

<p>Corollary: allow yourself to be wrong. Allowing yourself to be wrong with
yourself, your collaborators, and in public is a key optimization for learning
faster and building better things with less effort and in less time.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, machines tend to be somewhat amenable to measurement. We built
them that way. Indeed, constructing them to be somewhat measurable in the first
place was the only way we were able to assemble them at all despite our
innumerable shortcomings. We took the predecessor to your current machine,
chose some metrics to improve, made a huge number of mistakes while continuing
to measure, and occasionally we got lucky: the metrics we cared about improved
enough to alter production lines, crystallizing our occasionally successful
results into new production processes that eventually put your machine in front
of you.</p>

<p>We must measure.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that real programs on real hardware see real
improvements in relevant metrics like total cost of ownership, responsiveness,
etc… If a metric doesn’t help a human, it’s just a vanity pursuit that may
make the important metrics worse due to under-investment.</p>

<p>We must select our measurements with care. Our time is precious.</p>

<p>By making decisions that are considerate of available data, we are able to cut
through so much bullshit. We have so many ideas that our experience tells us
should cause our code to improve, but it simply isn’t true when we actually
measure. Code changes that made your Java, C++, Haskell or JS programs faster
may not make Rust any faster. Don’t make Rust code ugly just because some
program you wrote in the 90s worked better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">manual loop
unrolling</a>. Compilers change,
in many ways for the better.</p>

<p>Don’t be macho. Make decisions while having real data on-hand and limit the
damage of hubris.</p>

<h2 id="e-prime-and-precise-language">e-prime and precise language</h2>

<p>So many aspects of performance-critical engineering can be highly contextual
and may vary wildly from one machine to another. It helps to avoid the verb
“to be” and its conjugations “is”, “are” etc… when describing observations.</p>

<p>When we say something “is” something else, we are casually equating two
similar things for convenience purposes, and we are lying to some extent.
By avoiding false equivalences (usually easily spotted through use of “is”, “are” etc…)
we can both communicate more precisely and we can allow ourselves to reason
about complexity far more effectively. Situations that may seem completely
ambiguous when described using “to be” phrases are often quite unambiguous
when taking care to avoid false equivalences. This general form of speech
is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">E-Prime</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t say “lock-free queues are faster than mutex-backed queues”, say “on
hardware H with T threads running in tight loops performing operations O, our
specific lock-free queue has been measured to achieve a latency distribution of
X1 and our specicific mutex-backed queue has been measured to achieve a latency
distribution of X2.” It’s likely your lock-free queue will sometimes perform
worse than a well-made mutex-backed queue given certain hardware, contention
and many other factors. What does “perform worse” even …</p></section></div>

<p>Where I detail how MixedName got ~6200 concurrent visitors, serving in one day 438,136 uniques and 1,866,162 pageviews from a single $3 VPS.</p>
<h2>Launch of what?</h2>
<p><a href="https://mixedname.com/">MixedName</a> is a site for finding bilingual baby names — names which appear in two languages. It is designed to help international couples find a name for their baby, and I wrote it to name our Japanese-Finnish son.</p>
<p><a href="https://mixedname.com/bulgarian_danish_masculine_names"><img alt="" src="https://mixedname.com/bulgarian_danish_masculine_names.png"></a></p>
<p>At first it was a personal tool only supporting Japanese and Finnish. Then 5 years after our son was born, I was looking for a new project to start, and figured others might also want to look for names for their kids, so I continued on the project. </p>
<h2>Attempted launch</h2>
<p>After it felt polished enough and supported the most spoken languages in the world, I put it online and did the usual things: I submitted it to Product Hunt and Hacker News. The result was as I expected: complete silence. I know this is the nature of projects, silence is the default outcome.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mixedname.com/product_hunt_fail.png"></p>
<p>I mostly gave up on the site in my mind at this point, but kept it online for the off-chance that Google might still index it and send traffic later. In any case, I started working on the next project right away since I knew that search traffic probably wouldn't pan out either, and would take months to materialize even if it did.</p>
<h2>Reciprocal tip</h2>
<p>While procrastinating a bit on the next project, I discovered a new chat site on Hacker News called <a href="https://www.kardius.com/">Kardius</a>. It lets you find like-minded people by matching you based on opinions and interests, and I was having a good time chatting to interesting people there, and liked the site enough to stick around even after most new users had left. </p>
<p>With not many others around, I ended up talking with the admin of the site a lot. I wanted to help him grow it, but I was failing hard on coming up with workable ideas for him to promote it. We also talked a bunch about improvements to Kardius features. </p>
<p>Then much later he asked me if I had any sites of my own, and immediately after mentioning MixedName he told me about a Reddit community I had never heard about before, one solely focused on names! </p>
<p><a href="https://www.kardius.com/"><img alt="" src="https://mixedname.com/kardius_chat.png"></a></p>
<p>I hadn't even searched for such a subreddit, as it just seemed too niche to exist. The subreddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/">/r/namenerds</a>. So my attemps to help grow Kardius instead ended up mostly helping me instead.</p>
<h2>The real launch</h2>
<p>I tried posting to /r/namenerds and the response was phenomenal. Everyone was interested in the site, and it very quickly became the most upvoted post there. I received tons of fantastic feedback that truly helped me improve the site. I coded for two nights trying to fill as many of the requests as possible. </p>
<p>The suggestions ranged from requesting new languages, to inventing two completely new sections (reverse search for finding which languages use a name, and a <a href="https://mixedname.com/https://mixedname.com/top_names">top list of most compatible names</a>) for the site that I wouldn't have thought of myself.</p>
<p>Then someone on the subreddit made another suggestion: why not try posting it to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/internetisbeautiful">/r/internetisbeautiful</a>? Now that was a community I was well-aware of, but I hadn't thought my site would be good enough for posting there. But the suggestion received so many upvotes that I figured I'd give it a shot anyway.</p>
<h2>Traffic!</h2>
<p>That was like igniting a box of dynamite. Boom, the site was suddenly getting so many visitors that I felt very fortunate for having made it entirely static. Had there been any slow dynamic elements, with the single $3/month VPS I was using it would have been hugged to death immediately.</p>
<p>Upvotes kept racking up, and MixedName ended up being the third-most upvoted post on /r/internetisbeautiful this year. And because the subreddit is one of the default ones on Reddit, the link also made an appearance on Reddit's front page!</p>
<p>Although you had to scroll to around page three on the main page to see it, with Reddit being one of the most popular sites on the Internet, that still meant that at peak I had about 6000 concurrent visitors. I forgot to take a screenshot of that, but here's one from a little bit before.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mixedname.com/ga_realtime.png"></p>
<h2>Almost breaking the site</h2>
<p>I would have been totally glued to the Google Analytics realtime screen, except people kept sending me so many suggestions about the site that I kept improving it as well (while terrified I'd make some mistake to break it). Continuing to work on it ended up helping me in a surprising way. </p>
<p>I made some small change to the site and tried to push it live. But for some reason the push wouldn't go through? I had ran out of disk space!</p>
<p>Once I knew about the issue, solving it was easy. The reason was the first one that came to mind: I had mistakenly kept the nginx debug logging enabled, accumulating close to ten gigabytes of logs. After deleting the log and reloading nginx settings with debug turned off, everything was fine again.</p>
<h2>More traffic!</h2>
<p>Now on top of all this Reddit traffic someone reposted it on Hacker News, and it quickly became the most upvoted post there as well. </p>
<p>The crazy part was that the additional traffic was just a little stream compared to the Reddit torrent, even though on any other day I would have been jumping for joy over it. For perspective, after the top HN post I had perhaps 6200 concurrent visitors, compared to 6000 before from Reddit alone.</p>
<p>Interesting how Reddit clearly helped with HN, as my post there failed originally, but with now so many people aware of the site it seemed the HN upvotes were coming in more easily as well. That probably would have been the case with Product Hunt as well, but it was too late for that as I had already burned my chance there.</p>
<h2>Afterwards</h2>
<p>Now the party is over. Things are more silent again — currently at 27 concurrent visitors. The current residual traffic is from mainly three sources. </p>
<p>Firstly, as the Reddit attention resulted in a few other sites covering MixedName, those helped Google decide to start properly indexing the site. Secondly, many people seem to have shared the site on Facebook, and those shares are still sending traffic. Lastly, the now off-frontpage posts are still bringing a little bit of visitors from HN and Reddit.</p>
<h2>Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>So that's my launch story. First silence. Then a roar. Now a pleasant hum. I doubt anything I'll ever build will top this one-day record: 438,136 uniques, 1,866,162 pageviews.</p>

<p>On the most fundamental level, OpenGL is a software interface that allows a
programmer to communicate with graphics hardware. Of course, there is much more
to it than that, and you will be glad to know that this book explains the finer
details of OpenGL. But before we get our hands dirty and start coding, you'll
need to know a little about the history of Computer Graphics and OpenGL.</p>

<p>In the preface we'll explore the following topics:
* The inception of computers and computer graphics
* What OpenGL is and how it came to be
* How computer graphics work
* Hardware and software requirements for this book</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong></p><p>
    If you want to get straight into graphics programming without reading this
    lengthy history, you may skip straight to the "requirements" section below,
    read it, and start the next chapter. I have to stress, however, that having
    a thorough understanding of the history of computing, computer graphics,
    and OpenGL can be important in understanding future developments.
  </p>
</div>



<p>Whether through writing, painting, or body language, imaging has always been an
important player in relaying information and chronicling history. The
requirement for visual feedback is so important that it is hard to acknowledge
the existence of something if you cannot see it. Bacteria, for instance, were
purely speculative before their visual discovery in the seventeenth century by
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek who invented the microscope, but became an integral
part of modern science.</p>

<p>Computer data is represented in nothing more than electrical pulses, which are
also invisible to the naked eye. A method of displaying this data had to be
invented, so early computer scientists would get visual feedback from their
machines through a series of lamps mounted onto boards or long perforated paper
tapes, so called "punch cards."</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this information was far from readable and much
interpretation was required to convert the information into a human-readable
format. And even though computers were eventually equipped with electric
typewriters, the output was far from optimal.</p>

<h2>Display: Cathode Ray Tubes</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Ferdinand_Braun.jpg" title="Ferdinand Braun, inventor of the Cathode Ray Tube" alt="Ferdinand Braun, inventor of the Cathode Ray Tube"></p>

<p>In 1897, Ferdinand Braun invented the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) in Germany as a
type of vacuum tube whose purpose was to display an image onto a screen. You
may have seen or used them yourself in the form of glass-tube televisions and
computer monitors that were the norm until very recently.</p>

<p>CRTs were already being used for television and oscilloscope output, but
nobody had thought of combining this technology with computers. The first time
they were used to display computer output was in 1951 at MIT (the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology) where the Whirlwind computer was developed as a United
States Navy flight simulator. CRTs allowed the operators to instantly see the
output of a computer program without having to interpret punch cards, rows of
lamps or sort through reams of printouts.</p>

<p>While the Whirlwind project itself wasn't very successful due to high operating
cost, it was an important step into the direction of computer graphics by
introducing the CRT as a viable computer output device. The CRT became an
important player in the development of computer graphics, and remained the
output device of choice for over 50 years until it was replaced by newer
flat panel technologies.</p>

<h2>The First Interactions</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Sutherland_Lightpen-300x220.jpg" title="The light pen used with Sketchpad (Source: 1)" alt="The light pen used with Sketchpad (Source: 1)"></p>

<p>Though CRTs allowed computers to display their output, it was mostly text that
was simply meant to read out the computer's current state. This remained true
for some time since no one thought of the computer in any other fashion than a
pure computational device. It was not until 1961 when Ivan Sutherland developed
a computer program called Sketchpad for his thesis at MIT that would change the
way we look at computers dramatically.</p>

<p>Sutherland's Sketchpad program allowed users to draw geometrical shapes onto a
CRT with a light pen in real-time, something that was groundbreaking at the
time and remains remarkable even many years after. It not only defined computer
graphics, but also introduced the precursor of a GUI (pronounced "gooey," which
stands for Graphic User Interface) and laid the foundations of what was to
become a concept known as Object Oriented Programming. Sketchpad created a
paradigm shift in that computers were no longer simply number crunching
devices, but could also be used to display geometric shapes.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>FYI: Real-Time Computer Graphics</strong></p><p>
    Real-time computer graphics are generated on the fly, and usually in
    response to the user's input from a mouse, keyboard, or any other input
    device. Real-time graphics are often applied in applications such as video
    games and design programs.
  </p>
</div>

<p>In 1968, Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull engineered another technological feat,
namely "The Sword of Damocles," the forerunner of what we now call virtual
reality. This system displayed simple three-dimensional wireframe models to the
user through a headset, suspended from a ceiling because of its weight. This in
itself may have been one of the first (if not the first) time a form of 3D
graphics were generated by a computer.</p>

<h2>Smaller, Faster, Cheaper</h2>

<p>Of course, technology didn't just jump from punch cards to interactive
graphics; computers gradually evolved from massive machines to the small
devices that you use every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Eniac-300x229.jpg" title="Eniac, a famous first generation computer (Source: 2)" alt="Eniac, a famous first generation computer (Source: 2)"></p>

<p>From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, computers used vacuum tubes for processing and
would take up entire rooms. A vacuum tube is a device that can modify an
electronic signal in some way or another, such as switching, which is a
function that is imperative to computing. The components required to assemble a
computer were big and ran hot to the touch. None of the machines built during
this era were the same, and thus, their programs were not compatible with any
other machine. This era is usually referred to as the <strong>first generation</strong> of
computers and represents the first step in modern computer science. These are
the machines mentioned in the first section that used punch cards and lamps as
output devices, so they contributed little to the development of computer
graphics.</p>

<p>Transistors started to replace vacuum tubes during the mid 1950s, creating the
smaller, faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient computers of the <strong>second
generation</strong>. Transistors not only allowed for the creation of smaller
computers due to their small size, but ushered in a whole new generation of
consumer electronics as well. Radios, for example, could now be powered by
batteries and carried around, whereas before they were heavy stationary boxes.</p>

<p>But transistors themselves were not the Holy Grail for computing, and in the
mid-1960s, a new technology called the Integrated Circuit brought forth the
<strong>third generation</strong> of computers. Integrated Circuits miniaturized a certain
function that would normally have been performed by a series of individual
transistors onto a single chip. During the third generation, many computers
were being equipped with devices such as the keyboard, monitors, and a new type
of software called the Operating System, which allowed the computer to run
multiple programs. An important Operating System from this era was called UNIX,
which would influence many (if not all) following developments in Operating
Systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Intel-4004-300x157.jpg" title="The Intel 4004 Microprocessor -- the little chip that started it all (Source: 3)" alt="The Intel 4004 Microprocessor -- the little chip that started it all (Source: 3)"></p>

<p>In 1971, a major breakthrough in the field of computing occurred with the
invention of the microprocessor by the Intel Corporation, ushering in the
<strong>fourth generation</strong> of computers. Whereas CPUs (Central Processing Units)
normally were boards with many Integrated Circuits soldered onto it, the
Intel's 4004 microprocessor contained all of this functionality on a single
chip. Because of a cheaper production process, the computer slowly transitioned
from being a specialized device used by large companies and governments to
something much more accessible to the masses. We are currently still in the
fourth generation of computers, since we have not yet moved away from microprocessors.</p>

<h2>Personal Computing</h2>

<p><img src="https://openglbook.com/images/Apple_II-300x264.png" title="The Apple II Plus (1979) showing color display capabilities (Source: 4)" alt="The Apple II Plus (1979) showing color display capabilities (Source: 4)"></p>

<p>The first Personal Computers started to appear in the mid to late 1970s, but
were regarded as enthusiast machines for hobbyists. This changed somewhat with
the release of the Apple II by Apple Computer in 1977, and the PET by Commodore
International. These machines popularized the concept of computers for the
home, but did not have too much to offer in terms of computer graphics.</p>

<p>This somewhat changed in the 1980s when technologies such as GUI were
introduced to the personal computing market. The first dedicated graphics
add-on cards also started to appear during this era, notably the CGA (Color
Graphics Adapter) by IBM was the first color graphics card for the IBM PC
platform, which would pave the way for future developments by standardizing a
method of drawing computer graphics but didn't offer much in terms of graphics
capabilities.</p>

<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, most video games ran on specialized systems, movies
made use of computer animation only sparsely, and real-time 3D graphics were
for visualization purposes only since there was no consumer hardware that was
fast enough. These years were known for their many firsts on consumer hardware,
but it wasn't until the late 1980s to the early 1990s when computer games took
a strong hold on the PC platform and a real push for better looking and better
performing real-time graphics began.</p>

<p>One of the computer games that pushed what was possible on the hardware of the
day was Wolfenstein 3D, a first-person shooter released in 1992 by id Software.
While Wolfenstein wasn't truly 3D it defined the standard for future 3D
computer games. Only a year later, id Software released Doom, their first true
3D game. For the first time, the player could explore their environment through
the use of staircases and elevators, without being stuck to a certain
elevation. Many games followed that imitated the look and feel of Doom, and
were aptly dubbed "Doom-clones." Doom used a software …</p></div></div>

A few Kubernetes contributors are jumping ship from VMware. Four in a little over a week is nothing short of a sign, though. These aren’t the kinds of folks who like to hang out in big corporate orgs and feel like cogs in the machine. They want to feel like they’re making an impact and see the value in their work. They, like Deming, appreciate and take pride in their work. There is nothing at all wrong with this.

I can understand the appeal of the late-stage startup life too.</p><p>But, there is comfort in working for a 25-year-old organization inside a much larger organization that probably won’t muck with us too much given the current global situation. VMware completely sucked all the Heptio out of Heptio the second they started renaming and rebranding Heptio projects to VMware products. I have to hand it to Red Hat. Realizing that the CoreOS name meant something and keeping some of its projects active and incorporating the CoreOS name into products shows that at the very least, Red Hat appreciated CoreOS’s work. I don’t know if the same can be said for VMware of Heptio. Perception is often reality in these instances because we’ll never know otherwise unless folks speak up (which they are often not allowed to).</p><p><strong>DevOps’ish is brought to you by</strong> <a href="https://www.accurics.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish_181"><strong>Accurics</strong></a>.

<p>Anything bad that can happen — will happen. This old adage applies 100% to the technology industry, where crashes and outages are far more common than the sales and marketing teams would want us to think. However, DevOps engineers that deal with infrastructure know how hard it is to ensure everything works as intended all of the time — and to configure monitoring that actually keeps track of a system’s health and helps prevent crashes and downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <a href="https://statusgator.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">StatusGator </a>we monitor the status pages of more than 800 cloud-based services and deliver instant notifications to our users. We have mountains of data on downtime and outages and see the full picture, so we decided to make a quarterly top downtime list. We hope our findings will motivate DevOps engineers to see how others deal with service outages so they can improve their own reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to find out about the five biggest outages of Q2 2020 and how Slack, Zoom, GitHub, IBM Cloud and T-Mobile acted during these crises. We also rate the outcomes of these outages and would be glad to hear your thoughts on our ratings.</p>
<h2>Outage #1 – <strong>World-wide Slack outage, May 12, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary means of communication for thousands of companies worldwide, so its stable uptime is a matter of utmost importance. Thus, when users stopped being able to send and receive Slack messages around 7:30 PM EDT, the situation quickly escalated into a full-scale problem. Unlike during previous outages, this affected the entire Slack ecosystem: nobody could log in to Slack or receive any notifications. “Is Slack down?”, the users asked themselves and the answer was an undeniable “Yes!”</p>
<p>Anyone using the Slack Electron app was getting a generic HTTP error. Even the next day, after the issue had been resolved, people using the Slack app were still seeing the same error message. The app doesn’t refresh automatically so it was confusing for non-technical users, many of whom didn’t know they had to press Ctrl-R to refresh the app and restore service after the error.</p>
<p>The company confirmed they were aware of a situation and posted regular updates to <a href="https://status.slack.com/2020-05/147dad376c8946ff" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">the Slack status page</a>. Quite importantly, these updates were not standardized ‘we are aware of the situation, please stand by’ responses.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Team representatives wrote detailed messages that showed customers the Slack team were transparent about the challenge they faced and the efforts they made to overcome it.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are seeing performance improvements and you may be able to connect once again. We're working to fully restore service for everyone. Thank you for bearing with us.</p>— Slack (@SlackHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1260378685334409216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>At 10:26 PM EDT Slack reported full restoration of services and apologized for the inconvenience once again. Even more importantly, they published a detailed <a href="https://slack.engineering/a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-at-slack-dfe05b485f82" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">postmortem</a> on Medium, explaining the reasons behind the issue, the actions they performed to overcome it, the conclusions they came to, and the measures they were undertaking to eliminate the chance of a similar situation happening again.</p>
<p>Feel free to read this postmortem, it is very technical yet quite understandable even for laypersons. Slack demonstrates here that they care about members of their user base — both developers and the mass user base, and the confidence this article projects is admirable.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that while the issue itself started at 8:30 AM EDT, the issue went completely under the radar till around 7:30 PM EDT when multiple users reported issues with Slack. They reported them inside the app (which was mostly down by that time), on Twitter, on Downdetector, on the Slack website (which went down too quite soon) and through many other channels, before the Slack team became aware of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting notified about an outage would have been much faster and easier with StatusGator, where you can aggregate multiple status pages into one dashboard. StatusGator can send centralized notifications on downtimes for any services and APIs, and you can enjoy it with a <a href="https://statusgator.com/plans" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">free subscription plan</a>!</p>

</div></div>
<h2>Outage #2 – <strong>Zoom shutdown, May 17, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Zoom usage has gone up dramatically since the Coronavirus pandemic began as more people work and study remotely. So have subscriptions to the Zoom status page, which have skyrocketed in StatusGator since April.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2sgE3LGne0_xP2m3OP2ekivYBcg0PAOYeLqKRhTfEHZH6obapJBvPpiDy-1aYNSeaTUbgl220ZStj5_YWrayRzGfOvY6Uqt1WOLd4qQRDYTZAYgWcYAmqmLkoCOJvbQhTmRmswLA" alt=""></figure>
<p>Aside from businesses being forced to begin working remotely, many churches and other public organizations started using Zoom to hold Sunday masses, meetings, and to host public events. Thus, while Sunday is not a business day, many paid accounts in the UK quickly noticed that they were not able to host or join Zoom meetings (free accounts seemed not to be affected). The issue was reported through multiple channels, including Twitter and StatusGator that monitors the status of Zoom.</p>
<p>A Zoom spokesperson responded, acknowledging awareness of the situation and mentioning it was only affecting a subset of users. However, we all know a subset might be 1% or 99% and Zoom provided no indication whatsoever as to the volume of users affected. Providing more transparency into the percentage of affected users is a hallmark of a quality status page, something Zoom should improve.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there – We have received reports that Zoom users may be experiencing issues hosting and joining meetings. Please see <a href="https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY</a> for updates.</p>— Zoom (@zoom_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1262025037999214595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>The issue was reported resolved by 11:40 AM EDT, but Zoom provided no explanation or postmortem of any kind. Such an attitude, along with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Zoombombing</a> and a “Company Directory” checkbox in settings allowing users to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201956/zoom-leak-user-information-email-addresses-photos-contacts-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">leak corporate photos and emails</a> is one of the reasons many users are now actively seeking better alternatives to Zoom.</p>
<h2>Outage #3 – <strong>GitHub was inaccessible… Again. June 29, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>GitHub seems to be down a lot more since its $7.5 billion <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">acquisition by Microsoft</a>. The reasons have not been disclosed, and we can only speculate on the causes. Maybe it has something to do with integrating GitHub infrastructure with Microsoft systems. Maybe it’s because GitHub has been moving faster and adding more features. In any case, it’s been almost two years since the acquisition, and users are noticing more sustained periods of downtime at GitHub. Our independent <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/06/04/has-github-been-down-more-since-its-acquisition-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">analysis of the GitHub status page</a> confirms that the outages became more frequent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Microsoft is working hard to turn GitHub into an even better place for developers than it was before. The Redmond giant made all of the paid plans more affordable earlier this year and offered some key features for free to place more tools at the disposal of IT professionals. Microsoft, Apple, AWS, Google, Facebook and thousands of other companies use GitHub to store and run their code repositories, so its uptime is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GitHub was down for two hours on June 29, 2020. The entire website and its services were inaccessible, so many developers were not even able to push code or deploy their apps due to the number of GitHub integrations that were unresponsive. Naturally, this caused a major backlash and caused <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.blog/2020-07-08-introducing-the-github-availability-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">GitHub to introduce a monthly availability report</a> in addition to its status page, providing detailed explanations of the reasons and outcomes of every outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outage #4 – <strong>IBM Cloud went down along with the status page, June 10, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes any cloud-based service can do is to host its status page on its own infrastructure. It appears IBM Cloud did just that, so when its whole infrastructure became inaccessible for several hours in June, its status page followed suit. We could have expected IBM to draw some conclusions after the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-cloud-struggles-suffers-small-outage-dallas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Dallas downtime this March</a>, but, apparently, they did not bother, or did not make enough effort.</p>
<p>Thus, on June 10, 2020, the IBM Cloud infrastructure went down globally. This outage rendered features like Watson AI, IBM Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes Service, Cloud Object Storage, Identity Access and Management, VPN for VPS, App Connect and others completely inaccessible. Fortunately, the IBM Cloud status page was unavailable only in the early stages of the outage and became available intermittently later. That’s why StatusGator was still able to send alerts to users who had subscribed to the IBM Cloud status page.</p>
<p>The company totally failed to communicate the reasons for the outage, as well as the steps it took to alleviate the impact. It later became known from an independent monitoring service, that a 3rd-party network provider had extensively used the traffic routes, which resulted in severe constraints on the IBM Cloud configuration bandwidth. IBM specialists reconfigured their systems and restored operations, but no official explanations or announcements ensued — much to the disappointment of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time IBM has failed at public relations, nor, we think, will it be the last. This is probably one of the reasons for them to fall so far behind AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud providers, despite delivering a diverse range of competitive cloud services.</p>
<p>But what could IBM have done? Had an independent status page, naturally! Below are just some of the variants they could have used:</p>
<ol><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">StatusPage.io</a>. The largest and most popular platform around. This is probably the only provider big enough to handle companies like IBM Cloud.</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://status.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Status.io</a>. Another large and widely used status page provider with infrastructure meeting the scale that IBM Cloud would require.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, they could build their own status page, being careful <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">not to be dependent on any of their own infrastructure</a>. IBM could host it as a static page on a third-party CDN to reduce complexity and dependency on its network.</li></ol>

<p>With PWA’s not showing up in the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/03/how-to-use-iphone-app-library-ios-14/">App Library</a> in iOS14, it is once again super clear that Apple has no interest in investing in PWAs.</p>



<p>I can make a web app that runs full screen in a week, that can provide valuable information and that can run offline.</p>



<p>But Apple has no interest in promoting that app to be a first-class citizen. They want me to go through the arduous process of rewriting that app as a native iOS app. Of course, because any PWA can bypass the App Store, where they can make money.</p>



<p>When you try to make a full screen web app that runs on a phone — using a modern Javascript framework — you run into all kinds of OS-related problems.</p>



<p>The latest problem I have is that whenever I try to click a link in a demo app, I get to see the in-app browser. And there’s just doesn’t seem to be a way way around that. But I don’t want that – I simply want to show my apps UI.</p>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://johanronsse.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/proto.mp4"></video><figcaption>Bug in action. Notice the in-app browser showing up once I navigate out of the first screen. Anyone knows how to fix this? 😅</figcaption></figure>





<p>Instead of going to try and fix this “bug” I am just not going to. Because I know it’s probably a rabbit hole of trying different things and then coming to the conclusion that the root problem is simply iOS. I’ve been here before. I am not going down that rabbit hole again.</p>



<p>This isn’t new: for years, Apple has treated web apps as a second class citizen. Why would they invest in it? They make all of their money through the App Store, taking 30% of revenue. If PWAs work too well, people would invest in that instead, providing a way for developers to bypass the App Store.</p>



<p>So for years Apple has spent zero attention making PWAs work well. Instead of competing with Google’s efforts to make PWA’s first-class citizens, they instead actively work against web apps being a success on mobile.</p>



<p>Apple is quite invested in letting you design apps for their platform using their rules and their tools. So you can then make apps that only work on their platform.</p>



<p>And mind you, it’s a good platform. I’ve been a loyal iOS user for years. But it’s also a big walled garden where I think it would be nice if things were a bit more open. The devices are perfectly capable to run great web apps. Why do we have to make a native iOS version of our app, when web technology can give us cross-platform apps with a much easier dev cycle?</p>



<p>Lately Apple’s 30% cut policy has been under heavy scrutiny and I’m quite happy about that. I think 30% is way too much for the distribution of (native) apps.</p>



<p>People have discussed this heavily. I am not sure if Apple is in the wrong here – it’s their platform, they can run it the way they want.</p>



<p>I don’t even really buy any monopoly arguments or antitrust issues. The point I want to make is that Apple should take a close look at themselves and think if they are not hindering the evolution of computing as a whole. </p>



<p>In their efforts to control everything they have actively made iOS worse.</p>



<p>Because you can’t buy books on it directly, an iPad is a worse Kindle. Because you can’t sign up for Netflix on the device itself, the UX for new users is worse. And these are just two out of countless examples where Apple doesn’t really put the user first, but rather their business.</p>



<p>If you think about the user, you can set an evolution in motion. Yesterday I was trying out Playstation Now (which seems to have evolved quite a bit) – and last week I was checking out <a href="https://stadia.google.com/home">Stadia</a>. And this idea of just streaming is wonderful.</p>



<p>But, alas, that’s also something that Apple is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356274/microsoft-xcloud-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-testing-ends-apple-app-store-policies">not that interested in</a> (or more likely: that they are building their own proprietary tech for).</p>



<p>I understand Apple’s business decisions, but as a user, and especially as a web designer/developer, they can be frustrating.</p>

<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="856" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-1024x856.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-1024x856.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-300x251.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-768x642.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform-1070x894.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/too-many-things-in-platform.jpg 1449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>Most technology companies above a certain size start thinking about creating an internal platform team to build/manage systems that are used by multiple teams/products. This is a very high leverage team since they can beneficially impact many products at once and super-charge the organization. However, today I want to put some things that do not work well with internal platform teams, at least in the versions that I have encountered.</p>
<p>Tl;dr – It is better to operate multiple platform teams specializing in their own techno-business domains than to operate a single platform team. <a href="https://kislayverma.com/category/platform-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Platform Thinking</a> is not about reuse, it is about facilitating evolution, and fixating on reuse destroys that opportunity. Instil platform thinking in all teams and allow self-reliant domains and platforms to emerge organically instead of forcing the issue up front.</p>
<p><strong>What does this team do?</strong></p>
<p>Having a separate platforms team often means that all horizontal concerns start getting pushed to them. Eventually, this team cannot identify its customers and simply ends up supporting many useful but disjoint systems. It is difficult to set goals and a north star for such a company because they are decoupled from the end user “by definition”. The only intent of such a team is to maximize the reuse of systems within an organization without any regard to the purposes of those systems and the expertise needed to run those systems.</p>
<p>In worse situations, other teams have no qualms building reusable components. But when it comes to supporting the reuse in production, respecting SLO and SLAs with other teams, people immediately start looking for a platform team to dump the operations on. The result is an operations laden central team forever doing firefighting because of its poor understanding of what it owns.</p>
<p>As the number of shared use-cases in a company grows, the platform team becomes the repository of all kinds of unconnected components whose business purpose they are disconnected from. Eventually we end up with a “team” whose team members have no idea what the others are working on as each member ends up specializing in some part or the other. We get technical specialists but not subject matter experts in the topics that most impact the business. If business starts to get into trouble, the platform team and its work is often among the first to go on the chopping block. This is because it is very difficult to explain to business how this collection of quasi-experts will help them make money.</p>
<p><strong>The developer gold rush</strong></p>
<p>There is something fundamentally unsound about the popular two-dimensional view of an organization’s technical stack. It biases us to the idea that things at the bottom are more foundational in nature, or more complex. It is certainly true that lower layers support more “scale” than upper layers. All of these things cause developers to rush to join the internal platform team as soon as it is incubated. The work is seen as more prestigious or more central, in some way, to the organization. The fact is that at best it is more technical in nature so developers don’t have to deal with the messiness of the real world, customer facing products.</p>
<p>This represents an organizational challenge in multiple ways. One is just managing who gets to do what and which roles are considered cool (why aren’t non-platform roles considered “business features“ and not “awesome engineering”). The other part is managing expectations in the team that eventually does get formed, Creating the team is easy, but keeping them business/customer focussed is harder than expected. Some many platform teams are mired in a strange mix of technical arrogance and customer detachment, making them far less powerful than they can be.</p>
<p><strong>Other teams aren’t platform teams?</strong></p>
<p>If there is a platform team, then does it mean that other teams aren’t platform teams? With a catch-all team in place, other teams start abandoning platform thinking and start thinking in product silos.</p>
<p>If platformization has value, then it should be the mindset and strategy for all teams and not the domain on one single team. Since all business problems are made up of <a href="https://kislayverma.com/platform-thinking/platforms-and-dogfood-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">domain and organization context</a>, it stands to reason that all teams should be producing and operating platformized components. These platforms may be produced on top of others which are owned by other teams. The purpose of a platform or a generic product is not just reuse, but also to model a domain boundary where organizational expertise is centralized. The platform team cannot keep pulling in horizontal components wherever they arise because then they would have to be experts in all aspects of the business. The typical definition of a platform team which owns a bottom tier of reusable things is just not compatible with the way organizations work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that leads us to…</p>

<p><strong>Lines of ownership</strong></p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1022" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1024x1022.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1024x1022.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-300x300.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-768x766.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack-1070x1068.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a-typical-tech-stack.jpg 1494w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The tech stack of a company can be visualized with higher order system abstractions at the top and lower ones at the bottom. Which means that the skill set of operating the architecture can vary substantially as you go down the stack. This gives credence to the idea that the lower layers are somehow “different” from the upper layer and should be managed differently.</p>
<p>When we look at the technical stack, how should the lines of ownership run? Should they run horizontally, along components of similar level of abstraction, or should they run vertically, grouping systems generating end-to-end business value?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running an autonomous, cross functional team (and many many companies claim to do so), does the depth of the stack matter? The very premise of this team is to be able to work at all levels of the stack and in loose alignment with other teams at each level. In such a setup, the idea of a platform team with fixed horizontal charter is meaningless. Every team creates the layers of the platform that it requires, and shares them with others as needed. This keeps a low-overhead alignment process running because a component isn’t created only for reuse, it is created first for use and then gets reused as the need arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of ownership also solves the problem of orphaned components which everyone critically depends upon but no one team maintains. Open sourcing is a great idea for writing code but a terrible idea for operations. Software MUST have an operational owner – one team that is responsible for ensuring that it is running as it is supposed to and meeting the benchmarks it is supposed to. Autonomous teams operate what they build, and if we can teach them to build platforms, then we don’t need to explicitly create platform teams.</p>
<hr>
<p>But with that said, One of the big arguments against autonomous teams is that they often end up doing a bunch of repeated work. This is obviously suboptimal, so how can we minimize this.</p>
<p><strong>Solving the reuse problem</strong></p>
<p>This problem can be minimized by having <em>all</em> problems solved in a platformized manner such that once invented, all teams can benefit from the systems that emerge. There might be short term problems in aligning around launch dates and such, but in the longer run, all use cases of a certain capability or entity start getting centralized in one place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the team which built this platform doesn’t own it anymore. Reuse does not mean separating ownership from creation. A well designed platform is designed to keep the platform team out of the client’s decision cycle (external programmability), so if a notification platform is built by the marketing team and adopted by many others, the marketing team can continue to own and operate it – nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Once a reusable thing finds more than 3 customer (Atwood’s law), then it <strong><em>may</em></strong> be time to consider this a horizontal responsibility and move it to a separate team. I don’t say move it to a general purpose platform team, but to a specific team that can specialize in the domain modelled by the component and can commit to evolving it to the benefit of all its customers. E.g. A notifications system can kick-start a new business domain altogether – a little Twilio in its own right. Or it may be only a shared technical capability like Managed Elasticsearch which can be handled by a team of storage/elasticsearch experts in the storage platform team/ES platform team.</p>

<p>The above example shows that new teams and domains can be spawned off from every team’s work at either the same level of abstraction if the team originally owns all levels of abstraction in its work (aka a full-stack team). A new domain is a whole new reusable component in a sense. We grow the organization vertically by <a href="https://kislayverma.com/software-architecture/layering-domains-and-microservices-using-api-gateways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layering components</a>, and the layers are built creating reusable components atop each other. We also grow the organization horizontally by adding whole new problem spaces that need solving, and each of these will in turn new opportunities for deepening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This organic process goes against the idea of a fixed, co-located platform charter. The idea of a “platform team” confuses the idea of ownership and reuse just as it confuses the idea of “depth” of the platform in the stack with domain knowledge. I think it is far better to think in terms of teams in specific domains each developing their own platforms, and moving cross teams and merging as either redundancy or reuse is discovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my mind, the only platform teams on day one are the infra team (managing the hardware stuff) and perhaps the authentication/authorization team, and even these I think of business/tech capabilities rather than reuse/depth-in-the-stack driven teams. All other platforms should emerge from inside product teams. Think cellular division rather than divine hand.</p>

  <article>
    <p>It began when my coworker, despite already knowing how to program, was forced to take the intro level Computer Science course at my university. We joked with him about how he needs to make a program that works, but the grading TAs wouldn’t be able to figure out <em>how</em> it works. So that is the requirement, to make a functioning program that completes an assignment while obfuscating it such that the graders think that it shouldn’t work. With this in mind, I started to think through the arsenal of tricks in C that I’ve seen used before and one thing in particular stood out. The idea for this trick I will explain how to accomplish came from a blog with the name <a href="http://mainisusuallyafunction.blogspot.com/">main is usually a function</a> which got me thinking about when would main <em>not</em> be a function? Let’s find out then!</p>

<p>(If you want to download any of the files, <a href="http://jroweboy.github.io/downloads/2015-01-26-when-is-main-not-a-function/sources.zip">you can download a zip of all the files I wrote here</a> Remember that I wrote them on 64-bit Linux and you’ll need to adjust them to work on other platforms I’m guessing)</p>

<p>My problem solving process is typically the same thing I imagine most programmers do. Step 1: Google search about the problem. Step 2: Click every link on the first page that seems relevant. If not solved, try a different query and repeat. Thankfully, the answer to this question came on the very first search on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2252429/745719">this Stackoverflow answer</a>. Apparently in 1984, a strange program won the IOCCC where main was declared as a <code>short main[] = {...}</code> and somehow this did stuff and printed to the screen! Too bad it was written for a whole different architecture and compiler so there is really no easy way for me to find out what it did, but judging from the fact that it is just a bunch of numbers, I can surmise that the numbers there are just the compiled binary of some short function and the linker when looking for the main function just throws this in the place of it.</p>

<p>With our hypothesis in place, that the code for the program is just the compiled assembly of main function represented as an array, let’s see if we can replicate this by making a small program and seeing if we can do that.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>main</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-Wall</span> main_char.c <span>-o</span> first
main_char.c:1:6: warning: ‘main’ is usually a <span>function</span> <span>[</span><span>-Wmain</span><span>]</span>
 char main[] <span>=</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span>
      ^
<span>$ </span>./first
Segmentation fault</code></pre></figure>

<p>Alright! It worked! Kinda… So our next goal is we want it to actually print something to the screen. Thinking back to my limited ASM experience, I recalled that there are different sections of the compiled which determine where different things go. The two sections that are most relevant to us are the <code>.text</code> section and the <code>.data</code> section. <code>.text</code> contains all the executable code and it it readonly whereas <code>.data</code> contains readable and writable code, but it’s not executable. In our case, we can only fill in code for the main function, so anything that gets placed in the data section is a no go. We need to find a way to get the string <code>"Hello world!"</code> inside the main function and reference it.</p>

<p>I began by looking into how to print something with as little code as possible. Since I knew the target system is going to be 64-bit Linux, I found that I can call the system write call and it would write out to the screen. Looking back at this now that I’m writing the code, I don’t think that I needed to use Assembly for this, but at the same time, I’m really glad I got to learn what I did. Getting started writing inline GCC ASM was the hardest part, but once I got the hang of it, it started to become easier.</p>

<p>Getting started wasn’t easy though. It turns out that most of the ASM knowledge I could find through Google is all of the following: really old, Intel syntax, and for 32-bit systems. Remember in our scenario, we need the file to compile with a gcc on a 64-bit system, without any special modifications to the compiler flags, so that means there is no special compile flags, nor can we include any custom linking steps and we want to use GCC inline AT&amp;T syntax. Most of my time was spent trying to find information about modern assembly for 64-bit systems! Maybe my Google-fu is lacking :) This part was almost all trial and error. My goal was just use the write syscall to print “Hello world!” to the screen using gcc inline ASM, so why was it so hard? For the people that want to learn how to do this, I recommend the following sites: <a href="https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/">Linux syscall list</a>, <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Inline_Assembly">Intro to Inline ASM</a>, and <a href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/articles/linasm.html#Syntax">Differences between Intel and AT&amp;T Syntax</a></p>

<p>Eventually my ASM code started to form and I had some code that seemed to work! Remember, my goal is to produce a main that is an array of the ASM that prints Hello World.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>"movl $message, %esi;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>/* load the address of string into the second argument*/</span>
        <span>"movl $13, %edx;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>  <span>/* third argument is the length of the string to print*/</span>
        <span>"syscall;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>// call exit (so it doesn't try to run the string Hello World)
</span>        <span>// maybe I could have just used ret instead?
</span>        <span>"movl $60,%eax;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>"xorl %ebx,%ebx; </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>"syscall;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
        <span>// Store the Hello World inside the main function
</span>        <span>"message: .ascii </span><span>\"</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>\\</span><span>n</span><span>\"</span><span>;"</span>
    <span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Hurray! It prints! Let’s take a look at the compiled code in hex now, and it should match up one-to-one with the ASM code we wrote. I went ahead and broke down what’s going on in the comments to the side.</p>

<p>That looks like a functioning main to me! Now let’s go and grab the hex contents of it, and dump it in as a string and see if that works. We can get the hex from main by using gdb again. I’m willing to guess that there must be a better way, so maybe someone can post a comment on this and let me know :) The way I did it was to load gdb and print the hex at main like so. Last time we disassembled main, we saw that it was 49 bytes long, so can use the <code>dump</code> command to save the hex to a file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># example of how to print the hex</span>

<p>Now we have the hex dump, we can convert them all to integers the easiest way that I know of, and that is using python. In python 2.6 and 2.7 you can just use the following to convert it to a convenient array of ints for us to use.</p>

<p>I figure if my bash foo and unix knowledge was greater I could find an easier way to do this, but googling things like “hex dump of compiled function” returns several questions about how to print hex in various languages. Regardless, we now have a comma seperated array of our function, so let’s put that in a new file and see if it works! I went ahead and commented what each of the different values mean.</p>

    I've learned the hard way that using the word <i>automation</i>&nbsp;to
    describe an initiative, project, process, or algorithm is a bad idea.
    Equating automation with artificial intelligence is even worse. Anchoring a
    digital transformation on initiatives driven by automations completely
    misses the point.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post, I'm going to explain why you should avoid calling it
    automation, or at least, what some of the pitfalls are if you do describe
    the work you're doing as automation.
  </p>
  
  <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FGVVQ3_rP0/XzkQSANOxdI/AAAAAAAAh-c/4Sjw_ESKNk0iajEHZ4Ubi5_y0E_Q4eGGACLcBGAsYHQ/s576/Why%2BAvoid%2BAutomation.gif"><img alt="Automation Brings Detractors" data-original-height="324" data-original-width="576" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FGVVQ3_rP0/XzkQSANOxdI/AAAAAAAAh-c/4Sjw_ESKNk0iajEHZ4Ubi5_y0E_Q4eGGACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Why%2BAvoid%2BAutomation.gif" title="Automation Brings Detractors"></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, here is a bit of perspective. IT has been automating work for
    decades. Your data integrations are at least partially automated unless all
    you have is an SFTP folder and then perform all the steps to load databases
    manually. Who does that?&nbsp;
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    Your software build process may not qualify as CI/CD pipelines, but there
    are some aspects of going from code in version control to running the
    application that is almost definitely automated.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
  And yes, your choice of words is essential. What you name an initiative can
  either get executives and employees interested right from the outset or drown
  them in confusing buzzwords and acronyms.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    "Agile" - a great term! Who doesn't want to be agile? DevOps? Not good at
    all. DevOps was
    <a href="https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/#:~:text=Then%20in%202009%2C%20Patrick%20Debois,Ghent%20that%20lit%20the%20fuse.">first labeled back in 2009</a>, yet we're still defining the term, and most business leaders are still in
    the dark about it.
  </p>
  <div>
    <br>
    
    <h2>
      The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Automation
    </h2>
    
    <p>So here's how I break down the use of automation:</p>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The good</b> - Executives understand the word and will likely buy
          into initiatives promising automation because they equate it with cost
          reduction and quality improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The bad</b> - Automation sets a very high bar. Are you 100%
          automating a workflow or only a percentage of the steps? Will the
          automation be robust and handle 100% of the edge and outlier use
          cases, or is it more of augmentation, and people will need to handle
          some steps or exceptions? Will it scale on day one, or will you have
          to invest in the automation to achieve it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The ugly</b> - Someone or some group in your organization is going
          to equate your efforts to develop or improve automation with their
          loss of job, function, or importance. As soon as you announce, "We're
          automating X," then some people think, "Shit, does that mean I'm out
          of the job?" Even worse is if you hide it from people, and they find
          out about it through hearsay or when you're a sizable percent
          complete. Talk about creating detractors, you've just given a person
          or group plenty of reason to create speed bumps to frontal assaults to
          slow or stop your progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <p>
      Sorry folks, but the bad and ugly outweigh the good on using the word
      automation to describe your initiative.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have some advice for CIO and IT leaders on this topic. You may get your
      CFO on board, but they'll throw you out for round two investments if you
      underdeliver on their expected financial results of the automation.
      <a href="http://blogs.starcio.com/2017/03/how-to-handle-detractors-digital-transformation.html">And you'll immediately create detractors</a>
      who will help set an artificially high expectation on the percent and
      quality of the automation to help prove to everyone their value and your
      failure to sufficiently automate.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      When RPAs are Massive Technical Debt
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Let me add one more dimension to this rant and bring up one issue around
      robotic process automation, i.e., RPAs. Here's where an acronym does help
      IT, because when employees here they are being replaced by robots and
      automation, well, some are going to bring out the pitchforks and torches.
    </p>
    
    <p>The real problem is that RPA = code!&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
      You might be using a tool like UIPath, BluePrism, or Automation Anywhere
      to generate it, but don't fool yourself. That bot has code behind it. That
      automation will likely need maintenance whenever the tools, screens, or
      data that it depends on changes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now sometimes, the RPA is automating work from tools and screens that your
      organization does not own or control. Perhaps accounting has to go update
      three different third-party systems with updates on an order? These are my
      "good" RPAs as they clearly remove toil from a job that you can't fully
      optimize.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But what if your RPA is automating your own organization's tools,
      processes, or data? Well, that's code on top of code! Twice the tech debt
      to manage. While implementing an RPA may still have good business and
      technical merits, don't lose sight of the down-the-road impacts when you
      finally decide to upgrade legacy systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Avoid Setting False Expectations with Automation
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      If you've read this far, then great! You're ready for some advice. I'm
      going to provide the first one for free. If you want even better advice
      before the angry mobs come after you, then please sign up for my
      <a href="https://www.starcio.com/driving-digital?SQF_SRC=5nyike_sat-automation-2020-08-17">Driving Digital Newsletter with this link</a>. I'll be sharing additional recommendations in my next newsletter.
    </p>
    
    <p>So here's the most crucial advice:</p>
    
    <p>
      Don't call your project, initiative, program, release, or whatever you're
      working on based on what you are implementing - name it based on your
      goal, targeted impact, or objective!&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automating builds and deploys with CI/CD -&gt; "Deploy applications
          more frequently"
        </li>
        <li>Automating payroll -&gt; "Simplify how employees get paid"</li>
        <li>
          Automating account reconciliations -&gt; "Completing end-of-month
          reconciliations easier"
        </li>
        <li>
          Automating help desk tickets -&gt; "Improving employee experience and
          satisfaction"
        </li>
        <li>
          Automating web scraping -&gt; "Capturing more unstructured data with
          higher quality"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Get it? I know this looks superficial, but names mean A LOT! And naming
      things is not enough to avoid all the pitfalls I listed in this post. I
      have five other recommendations to go with it, so if this interests you,
      <a href="https://www.starcio.com/driving-digital?SQF_SRC=5nyike_sat-automation-2020-08-17">please sign up for the newsletter</a>.
    </p></div>
    
    <p>
      One last thought. Avoid labeling your investments in automation as
      artificial intelligence or anchoring digital transformations with
      automation investments. You'll have to wait for another post or two on
      these points.

<p>Similar to how <a href="https://www.paritybit.ca/blog/why-email-is-the-best-discussion-platform">I think e-mail is still the best discussion platform</a>, I think there is still a solid place for IRC in our lives.</p>
<p>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a communications protocol <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/irchistory.html">created in 1988</a> and, yeah, it shows. IRC is 100% plain text; no images, no videos, no stickers, no emoji reactions, just good ol’ plain text. It was also designed to transmit everything in plain text (i.e. unencrypted) all across the Internets in a time when the use of these computer networks was limited mostly to universities, governments, and large corporations. This was a time when Hollywood-style <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=1337%20h4x0r">1337 h4x0rs</a> were pretty much just kids using their modems to make long distance calls for free.</p>
<p>Nowadays, IRC is probably not such a good platform for private personal chats, but that doesn’t mean it’s not good for other things.</p>
<p>Arguably the best “feature” of IRC is that it’s still all in plain text. No multimedia or fancy features such as emoji reactions, integrations, or stickers keeps the bandwidth usage down and the focus on the content of what people are saying, rather than on distracting memes and flashy things. It’s the same reason why people like lean websites, plain text email, plain text notes, and so on: plain text is easy, portable, lean, and pure. You can even still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#File_sharing">send files using IRC</a>.</p>
<p>One aspect of computing and software design that many developers nowadays seem to forget is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds">over half of the world’s population does not have access to fast Internet</a> and many people, even in developed countries, are limited by bandwidth caps and spotty satellite or mobile Internet access. For these people, IRC can be the much better option compared to other collaboration platforms such as RocketChat, Mattermost, Slack, or Matrix, even if they have to use an IRC bouncer or a screen/tmux session on a remote server to not miss things if their connection is that spotty.</p>
<p>One of the biggest flaws I see people discuss when talking about IRC is that chat history is not saved by the server. This means that, if you want a record of the conversations which happen when you’re not connected, you’d have to use an IRC bouncer or screen/tmux session which will keep you connected when you have to go offline. I can definitely see this being a limitation for a private group chat if this is not something you’re willing to do, but when it comes to open source collaboration or support, this makes IRC great for hashing out ideas, asking quick questions, and having conversations while hacking on things. In these cases you don’t really care what’s happening when you’re not there because these are synchronous conversations which is perfect for the ephemeral nature of IRC.</p>
<p>Even though encryption is not mandated by IRC or enabled by default in many cases, you can still enforce encrypted client-server or server-server connections on your IRC server. This means that all messages in transit between clients and your server would be encrypted (usually with TLS) and the only weakness would be logs on the servers themselves or logs on client machines. If you and your friends like the plain text medium, it’s entirely possible to set up an IRC server which mandates encryption and doesn’t store logs long-term. If you’re in a group of people you can trust to be competent then it’s entirely possible to make IRC work this way and have a reasonable guarantee of privacy and security.</p>
<p>I suppose I should also mention the federating aspect of IRC since that’s quite a hot topic in the open source social platform world. IRC does federate in a way, but it’s not quite like the way Pleroma or Mastodon do. In the world of IRC, IRC networks are made up of one or more IRC servers. If you connect to an IRC server, you can view and interact with any channels or users on the same network that server is a part of. The way IRC exists right now is due to several network splits (netsplits) where many servers decided to split off of a big network to form their own, separate network several times throughout IRC history. This is similar to having a group of several Mastodon/Pleroma instances which have decided to federate with nobody else except those also in the group and is why we have the Freenode IRC network alongside the Undernet, EFnet, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason why this isn’t really such a big issue when it comes to IRC though is that IRC doesn’t really have accounts. Sure, you can usually register a nickname with a network’s NickServ bot to reserve it, but that’s not mandatory on most networks. This means you can join however many IRC networks you want with little hassle; you just have to connect and set your nick.</p>
<p>So, overall, IRC is still a really useful and good platform especially for software minimalists and technical users who wish to have a relatively hassle-free experience. IRC is great for open collaboration and quick support in free software projects (far better than Slack or Discord) and it can be made to work for private chats as long as you can trust everyone in the group to be competent. Yes, IRC is not necessarily great for non-technical users or those who require extensive guarantees of security; it might even be too much of a hassle for you, but this doesn’t mean it’s dead, useless, or outdated. IRC is not only still useful, but can still be the best tool for the job in the modern age. There are also improvements coming in the form of <a href="https://ircv3.net/">IRCv3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Introducing_cryptsetup-suspend"><a name="index1h2"></a>Introducing cryptsetup-suspend</h2>

<p>Today, we're introducing <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>, whose job is to protect the content of your harddrives while the system is sleeping.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can lock your encrypted harddrives during suspend mode by <a href="#index6h2">installing <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code></a></li>
<li>For <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> to work properly, at least Linux kernel 5.6 is required</li>
<li>We hope that in a bright future, everything will be available out-of-the-box in Debian and it's derivatives</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/timeline_old.svg" alt="timeline_old.svg"></p>

<p><strong>After:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/timeline_new.svg" alt="timeline_new.svg"></p>

<h2 id="Table_of_contents"><a name="index2h2"></a>Table of contents</h2>




<h2 id="What_does_this_mean_and_why_should_you_care_about_it.3F"><a name="index3h2"></a>What does this mean and why should you care about it?</h2>

<p>If you don't use full-disk encryption, don't read any further. Instead, think about, what will happen if you lose your notebook on the train, a random person picks it up and browses through all your personal pictures, e-mails, and tax records. Then encrypt your system and come back.</p>

<p>If you believe full-disk encryption is necessary, you might know that it only works when your machine is powered off. Once you turn on the machine and decrypt your harddrive, your encryption key stays in RAM and can potentially be <a href="https://blog.appsecco.com/breaking-full-disk-encryption-from-a-memory-dump-5a868c4fc81e">extracted by malicious software or physical access</a>. Even if these attacks are non-trivial, it's enough to worry about. If an attacker is able to extract your disk encryption keys from memory, they're able to read the content of your disk in return.</p>

<p>Sadly, in 2020, we hardly power off our laptops anymore. The sleep mode, also known as "suspend mode", is just too convenient. Just close the lid to freeze the system state and lift it anytime later in order to continue. Well, convenience usually comes with a cost: during suspend mode, your system memory is kept powered, all your data - including your encryption keys - stays there, waiting to be extracted by a malicious person.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are <a href="https://blog.appsecco.com/breaking-full-disk-encryption-from-a-memory-dump-5a868c4fc81e">practical attacks</a> to extract the data of your powered memory.</p>

<p>Cryptsetup-suspend expands the protection of your full-disk encryption to all those times when your computer sleeps in suspend mode. Cryptsetup-suspend utilizes the suspend feature of <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/README.md">LUKS</a> volumes and integrates it with your Debian system. Encryption keys are evicted from memory before suspend mode and the volumes have to be re-opened after resuming - potentially prompting for the required passphrases.</p>

<p>By now, we have a working prototype which we want to introduce today. We did quite some testing, both on virtualized and bare-metal Debian and Ubuntu systems, with and without graphical stack, so we dare to unseal and set free the project and ask you - the community - to test, review, criticize and give feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a screencast of <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> in action:</strong></p>

<h2 id="State_of_the_implementation.3A_where_are_we.3F"><a name="index4h2"></a>State of the implementation: where are we?</h2>

<p>If you're interested in the technical details, here's how <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> works internally. It basically consists of three parts:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/cryptsetup-suspend.svg" alt="cryptsetup-suspend.svg"></p>

<ol>
<li><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>: A C program that takes a list of LUKS devices as arguments, suspends them via <code>luksSuspend</code> and suspends the system afterwards. Also, it tries to reserve some memory for decryption, which we'll explain below.</li>
<li><code>cryptsetup-suspend-wrapper</code>: A shell wrapper script which works the following way:

<ol>
<li>Extract the initramfs into a ramfs</li>
<li>Run (systemd) pre-suspend scripts, stop udev, freeze almost all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a></li>
<li>Chroot into the ramfs and run <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code></li>
<li>Resume initramfs devices inside chroot after resume</li>
<li>Resume non-initramfs devices outside chroot</li>
<li>Thaw groups, start udev, run (systemd) post-suspend scripts</li>
<li>Unmount the ramfs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A systemd unit drop-in file overriding the <code>Exec</code> property of <code>systemd-suspend.service</code> so that it invokes the script <code>cryptsetup-suspend-wrapper</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Reusing large parts of the existing cryptsetup-initramfs implementation has some positive side-effects: Out-of-the-box, we support all LUKS block device setups that have been supported by the Debian cryptsetup packages before.</p>

<p>Freezing most processes/cgroups is necessary to prevent possible race-conditions and dead-locks after the system resumes. Processes will try to access data on the locked/suspended block devices eventually leading to buffer overflows and data loss.</p>

<h2 id="Technical_challenges_and_caveats"><a name="index5h2"></a>Technical challenges and caveats</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dead-locks at suspend</strong>: In order to prevent possible dead-locks between suspending the encrypted LUKS disks and suspending the system, we have to tell the Linux kernel to <em>not</em> <code>sync()</code> before going to sleep. A <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c052bf82c6b00ca27aab0859addc4b3159dfd3a4">corresponding patch</a> got accepted upstream in Linux 5.6. See section <a href="#What_about_the_kernel_patch.3F">What about the kernel patch?</a> below for details.</li>
<li><strong>Race conditions at resume</strong>: Likewise, there's a risk of race conditions between resuming the system and unlocking the encypted LUKS disks. We went with freezing as many processes as possible as a counter measurement. See last part of section <a href="#State_of_the_implementation.3A_where_are_we.3F">State of the implementation: where are we?</a> for details.</li>
<li><strong>Memory management</strong>: Memory management is definitely a challenge. Unlocking disks might require a lot of memory (if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a> is argon2i) and the swap device most likely is locked at that time. See section <a href="#All_that_matters_to_me_is_the_memories.21">All that matters to me is the memories!</a> below for details.</li>
<li><strong>systemd dependency</strong>: Our implementation depends on systemd. It uses a unit drop-in file for <code>systemd-suspend.service</code> for hooking into the system suspend process and depends on systemds cgroup management to freeze and thaw processes. If you're using a different init system, sorry, you're currently out of luck.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="What_about_the_kernel_patch.3F"><a name="index1h3"></a>What about the kernel patch?</h3>

<p>The problem is simple: the Linux kernel suspend implementation enforces a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/power/suspend.c?h=v5.5#n569">final filesystem sync() before the system goes to sleep</a> in order to prevent potential data loss. While that's sensible in most scenarios, it may result in dead-locks in our situation, since the block device that holds the filesystem is already suspended. The <code>fssync()</code> call will block forever as it waits for the block device to finish the <code>sync()</code> operation. So we need a way to conditionally disable this <code>sync()</code> call in the Linux kernel resume function. That's what <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c052bf82c6b00ca27aab0859addc4b3159dfd3a4">our patch</a> does, by introducing a run-time switch at <code>/sys/power/sync_on_suspend</code>, but it only got accepted into the Linux kernel recently and was first released with Linux kernel 5.6.</p>

<p>Since release 4.3, the Linux kernel at least provides a build-time flag to disable the <code>sync()</code>: <code>CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> (that was called <code>SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> first and renamed to <code>CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC</code> in kernel release 4.9). Enabling this flag at build-time protects you against the dead locks perfectly well. But while that works on an individual basis, it's a non-option for the distribution Linux kernel defaults. In most cases you still want the <code>sync()</code> to happen, except if you have user-space code that takes care of the <code>sync()</code> just before suspending your system - just like our <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> implementation does.</p>

<p>So in order to properly test <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code>, you're strongly advised to run Linux kernel 5.6 or newer. Fortunately, Linux 5.6 is available in <code>buster-backports</code> thanks to the Debian Kernel Team.</p>

<h3 id="All_that_matters_to_me_is_the_memories.21"><a name="index2h3"></a>All that matters to me is the memories!</h3>

<p>One of the tricky parts is memory management. Since version 2, LUKS uses argon2i as default key derivation function. Argon2i is a memory-hard hash function and LUKS2 assigns the minimum of half of your systems memory or 1 GB to unlocking your device. While this is usually unproblematic during system boot - there's not much in the system memory anyway - it can become problematic when suspending. When cryptsetup tries to unlock a device and wants 1 GB of memory for this, but everything is already occupied by your browser and video player, there's only two options what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kill a process to free some memory</li>
<li>Move some of the data from memory to swap space</li>
</ol>


<p>The first option is certainly not what you expect when suspending your system. The second option is impossible, because swap is located on your harddrive which we have locked before. Our current solution is to allocate the memory after freezing the other processes, but before locking the disks. At this time, the system can still move data to swap, but it won't be accessed anymore. We then release the memory just in time for cryptsetup to claim it again. The implementation of this is still subject to change.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.freesources.org/images/memories.gif" alt="memories.gif"></p>

<h3 id="What.27s_missing.3A_A_proper_user_interface"><a name="index3h3"></a>What's missing: A proper user interface</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, we consider <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> usable, but it certainly still has bugs and shortcomings. The most obvious one is lack of a proper user interface. Currently, we switch over to a tty command-line interface to prompt for passphrases when unlocking the LUKS devices. It certainly would be better to replace this with a graphical user interface later, probably by using plymouth or something alike. Unfortunately, it seems rather impossible to spawn a real graphical environment for the passphrase prompt. That would imply to load the full graphical stack into the ramfs, raising the required amount of memory significantly. Lack of memory is currently our biggest concern and source of trouble.</p>

<p>We'd definitely appreciate to learn about your ideas how to improve the user experience here.</p>

<h2 id="Let.27s_get_practical.3A_how_to_use"><a name="index6h2"></a>Let's get practical: how to use</h2>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> On Debian Bullseye (Testing), all you need to do is to install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/experimental/cryptsetup-suspend"><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package from experimental</a>. It's not necessary to upgrade the other cryptsetup packages. On Debian Buster, cryptsetup packages from backports are required.</p>

<ol>
<li>First, be sure that you're running Linux kernel 5.6 or newer. For Buster systems, it's available in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster-backports/linux-image-amd64">buster-backports</a>.</li>
<li>Second, if you're on Debian Buster, install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster-backports/cryptsetup">cryptsetup 2:2.3.3-2~bpo10+1 packages from buster-backports</a>.</li>
<li>Third, install the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/experimental/cryptsetup-suspend"><code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package from experimental</a>. Beware that <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> depends on <code>cryptsetup-initramfs (&gt;= 2:2.3.3-1~)</code>. Either you need the cryptsetup packages from <code>testing/unstable</code>, or the backports from <code>buster-backports</code>.</li>
<li>Now that you have the <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> package installed, everything should be in place: Just send your system to sleep. It should switch to a virtual text terminal before going to sleep, ask for a passphrase to unlock your encrypted disk(s) …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>With the iOS 13 release Apple has introduced a new tool - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">SwiftUI</a>, calling it â€œan innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swiftâ€�.  Released on September 19th, it remains one of the hottest news in October with a number of useful and easy to follow  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">examples and tutorials</a> have been published alongside it. Indeed, developing and implementing simple interfaces seems intuitive and fast. What about creating something more exciting?</p>
<p>We are going to try implementing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Cuberto/liquid-swipe">LiquidSwipe</a> using <strong>SwiftUI</strong> - a slider for switching between pages with a beautiful animation that could be used for flicking through stories in iOS  apps with social features or for navigation through an onboarding.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/liquid_swipe_brighter-compressed.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI slider example"></p><p>SwiftUI slider example</p>
<h2>LiquidSwipeView for a SwiftUI slider</h2>
<p>We need a new View that will represent our control:</p>

<p><code>View</code> will display the content of the current page, as well as two sliders on both sides for changing pages:</p>

<p><code>ZStack</code> is a simple container that displays its contents on top of each other, which makes it perfectly suited for creating overlapping elements in SwiftUI. In this tutorial, the left and right sliders are situated above the main page.</p>
<p><code>edgesIgnoringSafeArea()</code> lets us render the contents on the whole area of the visible interface, ignoring, well, the safe area. </p>
<p>Slider parameters are represented with state <em>variables</em>, described later in the tutorial:</p>

<p>Noteworthy, unlike the original framework by <em>Cuberto</em>, we wanted to try implementing two sliders with SwiftUI. Due to this, we have to define the side of the slider we are referencing:</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>In our simple example each page is just an empty colored rectangle:</p>

<p>All available page background colors are defined in an array of constants - <code>Config.colors</code>. In the code example below, we select the current page using the <code>pageIndex</code> variable:</p>

<p><code>@State</code> variables are a very powerful SwiftUI feature, where the user interface is automatically reloaded after the variable changes. For example, in this case it means that setting <code>pageIndex = 1</code> will prompt the page change and a UI update.</p>
<h2>Silder inplementation with SwiftUI</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s check the slider implementation:</p>

<p>The first point of interest is the type of the data variable - <code>Binding&lt;SliderData&gt;</code>. In SwiftUI, it means that we not only have access to the value of the variable, but can change the value as well. Note that there is something new here, a dollar sign next to the name of the value:</p>

<p>We use thisfeature in the wave method, which sets the shape of the slider so the interface would have that liquid look. In other cases we retrieve the value by calling <code>data.wrappedValue</code>.</p>
<p>So far, the slider uses a <code>ZStack</code> and includes a wave and a button. Additionally we define two more container parameters which we shall discuss in detail:</p>

<p>By changing <code>zIndex</code> we can set the order of the elements in the <code>ZStack</code>. We control it using the <code>topSlider</code> variable:</p>

<p>This variable represents the slider that is currently on top. When we interact with either slider, we set this variable to show the active slider above the other.</p>

<p><code>offset</code> lets us move the slider a bit to the right or to the left. We define the following state variable:</p>

<p>The slider does not have an offset most of the time. However, during the page change animation we hide the new sliders by setting <code>sliderOffset = 100</code>, and then revert this value to display the sliders. Apple made it quite simple to create this animation using SwiftUI:</p>

<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI animation"></p><p>SwiftUI animation</p>
<p>By default, iOS uses linear animation. However we can customize it using <code>withAnimation</code> parameters:</p>
<p>
Look how nice spring animation looks:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/2.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI spring animation"></p><p>SwiftUI spring animation</p>
<h2>Button</h2>
<p>The button consists of a gray circle and a white arrow that is backed up by simple math:</p>

<p>During the definition of the <code>ZStack</code> contents the center of the button is situated in the (0, 0) point. After that we use the offset method to move the button to the desired point (which is calculated using <code>SliderData</code> - it will be described a bit later). By doing this, we automatically set the transparency of the button - the further we move the slider, the more transparent it gets. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Untitled-1.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI button animation"></p><p>SwiftUI button animation</p>
<h2>Wave</h2>
<p>We use a separate object for presenting the wave - <code>WaveView</code>. It is created (and set up with the background and gestures) in the wave method:</p>

<p>The index function returns the index of the next (or previous) page - depending on the side of the slider. It also handles switching between the first and the last page:</p>

<p>Now we need to define 3 gestures:
Getting hold of the slider and switching the page, during which the wave is updated.
Letting go of the wave, where we have to either change the page, or return the wave to the original position.
Tapping the wave, resulting in an instant page switch.</p>
<p>All gestures are combined into one, that can be used for setting up <code>WaveView</code>:</p>

<p>Here are the gestures at a closer look.</p>
<h3>1. Drag gesture</h3>
<p>During the page switch, first thing we do is persist the side of the wave, to render it on top:
</p>
<p>Then, we calculate the new state of the wave using the current state and the movement values:
</p>
<p>The state calculation is rather straightforward and will be presented after describing <code>SliderData</code> contents.</p>
<h2>2. Drop gesture in SwiftUI</h2>
<p>This is a slightly more complicated gesture:</p>

<p>First we check if the slider is far enough to trigger a page change. Otherwise it should be returned to the original position by calling the already familiar <code>withAnimation</code> method:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/4.gif" alt=""></p><p>A separate function is responsible for initiating a page switch: </p>

<p>In the beginning we animate the wave to the final position. Then, after a short delay, we change the page, return the wave to the original state, and animate the new sliders by changing the <code>sliderOffset</code> variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/5.gif" alt="" title="SwiftUI page change"></p><p>SwiftUI page change</p>
<h3>3. Tap gesture</h3>
<p>Tapping a wave combines two actions described above. First we save the wave that should be drawn on top:
</p>
<p>Then the page switch is initiated.
</p>
<h2>SliderData</h2>
<p>3 key parameters comprise slider data: the side of the slider, the vertical coordinate of the wave center, and the progress of the page switch (ranges from 0 to 1).</p>

<p>All other parameters are calculated dynamically from the key parameters:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/liquidswipe_q.png" alt=""></p><p>Now, what all these parameters are used for? Initially we create data for each slider with zero progress and a different center for the right and left waves.</p>

<p>After the swipe we set the wave to the initial or final state. In this case the center of the wave doesnâ€™t change, and the progress is set to the either end of the range:</p>

<p>Dragging the wave isnâ€™t much more complicated:</p>

<p>The progress is linearly dependant on the waveâ€™s horizontal position, and the wave center is equal to the tapping point.</p>
<p>The method used to decide if the page should be changed is also rather simple:</p>

<p>We simply compare the current progress with an arbitrary constant (0.15 in this case), and revert the wave to the original position if the threshold is not met.</p>
<h2>WaveView</h2>
<p>The last object we need to implement is the <code>WaveView</code>. Hereâ€™s how we do it:</p>

<p>It is a Shape that uses the same 3 parameters as <code>SliderData</code>. The only difference is that the center of the wave and the progress can change. It is necessary so that SwiftUI can automatically animate the wave with access to only the beginning and final states.</p>
<p>To make this possible we define in SwiftUI <code>animatableData</code> variable:</p>

<p>We use this variable to represent the state of the wave as 2 floating point numbers and describe how to get and set them. This is enough to automatically animate the wave, because SwiftUI can animate floating point numbers from the box.</p>
<p>Finally, the path function defines the shape of the wave.</p>

<p>This method is verbose and mathematically complex, so we wonâ€™t include the code in the tutorial. You can check out the full implementation on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/LiquidSwipe">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, <strong>SwiftUI</strong> is great not only for simple UI creation. Complex controls and effects can also be efficiently and succinctly described by this new tool, which this tutorial hopefully demonstrated. We have no doubt that SwiftUI will become a new standard for declarative interface creation on Apple platforms, so any Apple developer might want to consider familiarising themselves with it. Don't forget to check out another one of our <a href="https://exyte.com/blog/replicating-apple-card-application-using-swiftui">SwiftUI</a> tutorials and best of luck! </p>

<p>UPD: a fellow redditor managed to run it on Apple Watch too. We only tested it on phones but do not let it stop you from trying. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long. Universities are necessary for some kinds of careers and for some kinds of research. Far more often, the price is just too high. The worst part of this cost isn't dollars either—it's four years of a person's life.</p> <p>Nearly anything universities teach can be learned outside of a university, and usually faster. I've experienced this first hand with mathematics, foreign languages and programming but it's certainly a wider phenomena.</p> <p>According to George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YLbmNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 10%-20% of the value in schooling is actually education</a>. The other 80%-90% is selection and signalling.</p> <h2 id="what-products-are-exceptions"><a href="#what-products-are-exceptions">#</a> What products are exceptions?</h2> <p>If I were selling very expensive tools for skilled professionals, like Adobe used to, then I'd offer student discounts. Even a person in relatively fortunate circumstances has fewer resources than a typical company.</p> <p>Dropping a few dollars a month doesn't move the needle compared to tuition, but spending thousands of dollars on a photo or video editor sure could.</p> <p>Another factor in Adobe's case was that by being <em>the</em> tool to use in the industry, students needed to learn it. Anyone trying to become a designer pretty much had to find a way, even if that meant "pirating" it. Giving students convenient affordable access to such a tool is also a great way to <em>become</em> a standard tool in the industry.</p> <p>Even Adobe didn't limit their discounts to US students, though. Doing so might have cost them billions.</p> <h2 id="the-bottom-line"><a href="#the-bottom-line">#</a> The bottom line</h2> <p>Having a .edu email address generally means being in the most expensive and desired university system in the world.</p> <br>  <br> <hr></div></div>]]>

        <h2 id="benfords-law">Benford’s Law<a href="#benfords-law" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>After watching a Netflix documentary about Benford’s Law, i got really interested in it because it can help detect fraud in e.g. balance sheets. So i searched my favorite programming languages and detected that there is no npm Package for checking Benford’s Law.</p>
<p>Sooo … Long story short: I created nearly identical libraries for doing a Benford’s Law check in JavaScript, Go and Crystal. My inspiration was from a Python library - so the algorithm of these libraries is nearly identical. There are some catches like i used many different math libraries for calculating chi-square and some of these libraries offer addition information, others not …</p>
<p>But i think this gives us a good example of a algorithm which is implemented in different programming languages and can be benchmarked. That’s what i wanna do in this post: Comparing the Benford’s Law check in different Languages.</p>

<p>I didn’t expected that big difference. Go is clearly the winner here and that with big distance to the other implementations. One reason why Python took so long may be that the used library shows additional information but i don’t think Python could compete with the other implementations if the library wouldn’t show more.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that Go is very very fast compiling. Crystal isn’t even in the area of the Go compile time.</p>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

We will be using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/">Netlify Redirects</a> and a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a>.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to create my own URL shortener and use it to shorten all my links. But I always felt like creating it would take a lot of effort, although I never actually gave much thought to it. </p>

<p>But I came across a tweet containing a link to the video which showed how to create a simple URL shortener. This blog post is my attempt to share that approach with you.</p>
<p>Before we see how to create your own URL shortener, let's see why having a URL shortener can be useful.</p>
<p>If you are already convinced that having your own URL shortener can be useful, you can skip this section and directly jump to <a href="#creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-shortening-your-urls">Benefits of Shortening Your URLs</h2>
<h3 id="it-masks-the-original-links">It masks the original links.</h3>
<p>Masking the URL has many advantages</p>
<p>For example, take this URL - <code>hashnode.com/series/how-i-made-a-markdown-editor-with-ability-to-embed-youtube-videos-codepens-etc-cke6g1y2x00afxms17vp30803</code></p>
<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</h2>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>
<h3 id="netlify-redirects">Netlify Redirects</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0
  3c:   8904            sys 4
  3e:   0000            halt
  40:   0009            .word   11
  42:   15c2 0200       mov $1000, r2
  46:   892d            sys 55
  48:   7e82            sob r2, 0x46
  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/pdp11-branch.png">
	
		<figcaption>PDP-11/45 Handbook Describing the Branch instruction</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>

to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had an hour-long conversation yesterday talking to a fellow entrepreneur who quit the adventure and took a job. He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt. Sankalp and I did just enough things right this time (or avoided just enough mistakes) to make the business work. </p><p>The journey to reaching here was long, filled with doubt internally and from everyone around me, even frustrating and hopeless at times.</p><p>Out of all the things we talked during the call, the three things that stood out to me were:</p><h3><strong>1-</strong> I kept trying again and again</h3><p>If something didn't work, I would find a job to save up and try again as soon as I have a year's worth of runway and a strong enough conviction about the idea. </p><p>As of today, I don't see any other path in life but building businesses.</p><h3><strong>2-</strong> I knew when to quit</h3><p>When things weren't working out no matter our best effort, clearly there was something wrong. I spent 12 months on my second venture before realising there's no market demand. </p><p>But I quit my third venture (right before SuperLemon) in about 4 months when it was obvious to me that it wasn't going to work.</p><h3><strong>3-</strong> Introspect </h3><p>After every attempt or failure, I would spend between 1-3 months in intense introspection of what went wrong. </p><p>This wasn't an exercise to beat myself up over it, but rather to learn what I need to do differently the next time for things to work out more favourably.</p><h3>If you're a budding entrepreneur</h3><p>I don't recommend this path to anyone unless they are willing to take all the pain and failures, learn from them, and try again with the hope to eventually get it right.</p><p>Quit sooner than later when something isn't working, but only if you've understood why it won't work. </p><p>Ask always yourself if you're in it for the long haul. Otherwise you might as well quit right now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> are not created equal.  Some go up in value and some don’t.  A depreciating asset is one that goes down in value over time.  Examples of depreciating assets are cars, boats, motorcycles, computers, RVs and furniture.  These assets will almost always be worth less than what you paid for them when you decide to sell them.</p>



<p>Many depreciating assets, such as cars, also have other costs associated with their ownership as well. Taxes, insurance, fuel and maintenance can all add up to make your total cost of ownership of a depreciating asset much higher than is reflected in the purchase price.</p>



<h2>Depreciation Rate  </h2>



<p>The difference between what you paid and what you sell the item for is your cost to own the asset.  Not all items of the same type depreciate at the same rate.  Luxury cars such as a BMW might depreciate at 20% a year, where as a Toyota Tacoma might only depreciate at 10% a year.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="BMW M Series" title="Cars are a Depreciating Asset" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bimmer.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>BMW M3 Hauls tail but drops like a rock in value</figcaption></figure>



<p>Take the depreciation rate into account when making a large purchase as it will greatly affect the total cost to own the asset.  Not only would a BMW be double the purchase price of the Tacoma, but it would also depreciate twice as fast.  This ultimately makes your total cost to own the vehicle 4 times as high!</p>



<h2>Limit spending on Depreciating Assets</h2>



<p>You will want to limit the money you spend on depreciating assets as much as possible.  In general these assets will not help you to compound your wealth.  You will need to purchase depreciating assets to live your life but don’t fool yourself into thinking that these material purchases make you wealthy.  In fact they do just the opposite!  </p>



<p>Every dollar you spend on a depreciating asset is one that you cannot invest.  Due to the compounding nature of investment returns you can actually lose out on many times the original purchase price of the depreciating asset due to the <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a>. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Depreciating assets are generally material goods that you purchase to use.  As they age they lose value, decreasing your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> in the process.  Limit your spend here so that you can concentrate on investing the savings instead.  </p>



<p>Whatever your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, overspending here will make them harder to obtain.</p>

<p>I got this email from Linkedin this morning. It is telling me that they are going to change my location from “<strong>Auckland, New  Zealand</strong>” to “<strong>Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand</strong>“. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="512" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png 496w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"><figcaption>Email from Linkedin on 30 August 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>
