<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr
<a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">Here</a> you can find the first blog post about automated releasing. The purpose of this blog post is to show how you can do the same automation in non-JavaScript projects. Even if JavaScript community created tooling, you can still use it in other projects and don’t freak out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post and the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">previous one</a> come from our experience we gained when working on full automation for all tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/" target="_blank">AsyncaPI Initiative</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/" target="_blank">AsyncAPI</a> is a specification that you use to create machine-readable definitions of your event-driven APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The previous post focused on JavaScript as the first library that we automated was our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">generator</a>. It covered publishing to NPM and usage of the JavaScript community ecosystem. Now we have automation rolled out to all our libraries, Go-written too.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-need-to-automate-release">What I need to automate release?<a href="#what-i-need-to-automate-release" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To automate a release efficiently, you need two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine-readable information that allows you to identify if a given commit should trigger a release or not.</li>
<li>Tooling that you can easily plug in and configure without the need to write everything from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<p>This automation is possible thanks to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/" target="_blank">Conventional Commits</a> specification. The purpose of Conventional Commits is to make commits machine-readable but also human-readable. It defines a set of commit prefixes that can be easily parsed and analyzed by tooling and looks good to the human eye too.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release" target="_blank">Semantic Release</a> package and related plugins that support Conventional Commits and publishing to different channels like GitHub, NPM, Slack, and others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-s-the-catch">Where’s the catch?<a href="#where-s-the-catch" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>This blog post is about the automation of releases for non-JavaScript projects. Let me be honest though, solutions I mentioned in the previous chapter come from the JavaScript community.</p>

<p>The problem is, there are people who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/9pwzpn/why_do_people_hate_javascript/" target="_blank">Hate JavaScript</a>, they truly <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-JavaScript-so-hated" target="_blank">hate it</a> like it is a living thing. Although, I’m personally proud to be an idiot that has a programming language that I can use.</p>

<p>Conventional Commits specification is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format" target="_blank">Angular Commit Guidelines</a>. The Semantic Release package and its plugins ecosystem are all Node.js packages.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/10FHR5A4cXqVrO/giphy.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you have Java or Go project, you can still use these tools. You do not have to keep <code>package.json</code> in your repository, so don’t worry, you can keep your repository clean. The great folks from Semantic Release thought about you too.</p>

<p>One of the projects where we use this JavaScript tools is our parser for AsyncAPI documents. It is a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-go" target="_blank">Go parser</a>.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-release-configuration">Semantic Release configuration<a href="#semantic-release-configuration" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The Semantic Release package supports configuration files in different formats and file types. You are not bound to <code>package.json</code>. We chose to use <code>.releaserc</code> file in YAML format but there are <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration-file" target="_blank">other options</a> too.</p>

<pre><code>---
branches:
- master
plugins:
- - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/github"
  - assets:
    - path: asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64
      label: Binary - Darwin AMD64
    - path: asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64
      label: Binary - Linux AMD64
    - path: asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe
      label: Binary - Windows AMD64
</code></pre>

<p>Our configuration uses plugins to:
- Analyze Git commits with Conventional Commits specification.
- Create a Git tag and generate changelog for release notes.
- Publish a release with additional assets. We compile our parser as binaries that are compatible with many platforms and we want to have them easily accessible with each release.</p>

<p>We place the configuration under <code>.github/workflows/</code>, next to our GitHub Action release workflow file: <code>release.yml</code>. It indicates that it is for release only, nothing else.</p>

<h3 id="release-workflow">Release workflow<a href="#release-workflow" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>Let us have a look at the differences between this workflow and the workflow I described for a typical JavaScript project <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, you define a <code>test</code> job with the Go environment to trigger tests with different versions of Go.</p>

<pre><code>test:
  name: 'Testing'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      go: 
        - '1.14'
        - '1.13'
        - '1.12' 
  steps:
    - name: Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
      with:
        go-version: '${{ matrix.go }}'
    - name: Invoking go test
      run: go test ./...
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is the <code>release</code> job, where you can differentiate two core steps. The first part is the generation of the binaries that you want to expose in the GitHub release.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Setup Go
  uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
  with:
    go-version: '1.14'
- name: Invoking go vet and binaries generation
  run: |
    go vet ./...
    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
</code></pre>

<p>So far, it is all Go-related operations. How about the release? For the release, you need to set up a Node.js environment to run Semantic Release. Node.js community has this excellent package, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx" target="_blank">npx</a>, that allows you to run a package without installing it, and this is what you can do here in the workflow.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: 13
- name: Add plugin for conventional commits
  run: npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
  working-directory: ./.github/workflows
- name: Release to GitHub
  working-directory: ./.github/workflows
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: asyncapi-bot
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: asyncapi-bot
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
  run: npx semantic-release
</code></pre>

<p>You only have to install <code>conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits</code> explicitly if you want to use <code>conventionalcommits</code> preset when analyzing Git commits and generating the changelog:</p>

<pre><code>plugins:
- - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at full release workflow for reference:</p>

<pre><code>name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    name: 'Testing'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        go: 
          - '1.14'
          - '1.13'
          - '1.12' 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
        with:
          go-version: '${{ matrix.go }}'
      - name: Invoking go test
        run: go test ./...
  
  release:
    name: 'Release to GitHub'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: 
      - test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
        with:
          go-version: '1.14'
      - name: Invoking go vet and binaries generation
        run: |
          go vet ./...
          GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
          GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
          GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 13
      - name: Add plugin for conventional commits
        run: npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
        working-directory: ./.github/workflows
      - name: Release to GitHub
        working-directory: ./.github/workflows
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: asyncapi-bot
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
          GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: asyncapi-bot
          GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
        run: npx semantic-release
</code></pre>

<p>You see, you can still have your project “clean” from any JavaScript-specific files and references. Everything you need for running your release with the JavaScript community tooling is only in the release-related configuration.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>I don’t think I can ever understand this “hate” towards JavaScript. I think, though, that you can “hate” the language, but if you see some amazing tooling built with it, that can increase your productivity, grit your teeth, put bias aside, and enjoy life. Especially, if in exchange you get this excellent feature, notification about release under the Issue and Pull Request:</p>

<p>One of the few remaining challenges of deploying applications as microservices, running in containers, is complexity. A cloud environment may start as a simple ecosystem for microservices, but it doesn’t take much for that simplicity to be replaced by a complex web of containers.</p>



<p>Modern container orchestration systems like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a> don’t really help with simplicity either. In fact, it is too easy to end up with a complex network of pods across multiple clusters when you don’t incorporate Kubernetes deployment best practices correctly.</p>



<p>When it was first made popular back in late 2019, the <a href="https://cnab.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Native Application Bundles</a>, or CNAB, is designed to combat the complex nature of containerisation. Today, CNAB has become the go-to standard for simplifying the process of bundling, installing, and managing apps in containers.</p>



<h2>A Cloud-Agnostic Solution</h2>



<p>CNAB was first introduced in 2018, but it wasn’t widely adopted until late in 2019. As a standard, one of the biggest advantages offered by CNAB is its support for any cloud computing environment. Yes, it is a cloud-agnostic approach that can be implemented in any environment.</p>



<p>In fact, the primary goal of CNAB is to make containerisation easier to incorporate across different cloud environments. Moving a bundled app from one cloud cluster to another should involve nothing but the standardised process.</p>



<p>CNAB itself is a tool that was initially developed by Microsoft and Docker. Considering that <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker </a>is still used on top of existing container orchestration systems, it is easy to see how CNAB immediately became the universal tool to use.</p>



<p>Before we get to the technical side of CNAB, there are several additional advantages to acknowledge first, starting with the fact that <strong><em>CNAB makes deploying applications easy</em></strong>. Since packages are standardised, you can scale up the distribution of pre-made apps.</p>



<p>That level of standardisation is perfect for developers offering on-premise or self-hosted solutions. Rather than having to manually install and configure everything, applications can be delivered as packages or bundles, and any cloud administrator can install them easily.</p>



<p>CNAB also <strong><em>highlights security as an important factor</em></strong>. The signing and verification runtimes that are part of CNAB makes securing bundled apps easy. In fact, administrators can always check the crypto signature of bundled apps to make sure that they come from legitimate sources.</p>



<h2>Introducing: Duffle</h2>



<p>The packaging and unpacking of cloud-native applications are best done using <a href="https://duffle.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duffle</a>, a tool natively built to adopt CNAB. It is the implementation of the CNAB specification to the letter, despite many other tools introducing their own takes on authoring application bundles.</p>



<p>Duffle depends on a Docker engine to build and install CNABs. If you are using a local development environment, you need to make sure that you can use Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, or Docker on Linux to eliminate the dependency. You can also use Docker in the cloud if one is available.</p>



<p>The tool itself is straightforward. Once you have your application ready for deployment, simply run <strong><em>duffle build ./appfolder/yourapplication/</em></strong> to start the process. Duffle will take you through 6 steps and you will have a successful build at the end of the wizard.</p>



<p>Running bundled applications requires you to run <strong><em>duffle install</em></strong> command while cleaning up applications can be done with the <strong><em>duffle uninstall</em></strong> command. You may also want to generate credentials for the bundled apps for them to run properly.</p>



<p>There are some parameters to be defined before you can bundle applications successfully, starting with the usual name-version-description-keywords combination of the metadata. You can then add <em>cnab</em> under <em>invocationImages</em> and begin defining how the bundle should be processed.</p>



<p>Everything else is easy. The app itself can be in any form you like as long as it is designed to run in Docker containers. You can also define user-overridable parameters for the install process, plus you can embed executable images if there are dependencies to manage.</p>



<p>That’s the entire CNAB standard. As long as these parameters are defined, you will have no trouble creating bundles and installing them using the commands we discussed earlier.</p>



<h2>Thick and Thin</h2>



<p>One last thing to understand about CNAB and how it makes containerisation of cloud-native applications easy is the two types of bundles you can create: thin bundle and thick bundle. As the names suggest, thin bundle contains only the bundle definition, while thick bundle also includes all of the invocation images and additional resources that may be required.</p>



<p>A thin bundle requires an active repository. This is because when the bundle is installed, tools like Duffle will try to find the correct packages from storage repos. Thick bundle is usually the safer way to go when you need to bundle applications without additional dependencies, such as when the bundle is needed for on-premise deployment.</p>



<p>Every bundle is signed to prevent tampering. Regardless of the bundle type you use, CNAB allows for consistent bundling, installation, and management of containerised applications without fail.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  

  <p>It’s hard to write software that is easy to maintain and adapt to change.
There’s a multitude of maxims to try and tease out general solutions to this, or
at least approaches that can mitigate the problem.</p>
<p>This point did the rounds on Hacker News and elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">programmingisterrible</a></p>
<p>This is one of the better maxims for producing maintainable and adaptable
software. One of the most important aspects that distinguishes it is that it
acknowledges that <em>your code is probably bad</em>. At some point, in some situation,
in someone’s perception, the code you are writing now is going to be bad and
difficult. The person that encounters that difficulty is also likely to be you.</p>
<p>Other maxims and approaches to this problem go down the route of trying to
improve the code, and once they’ve taken that junction, they leave behind a
whole avenue of thought around acknowledging the basic fact that any code will
be bad in some situation, and that trying to optimise it often tends to actually
exacerbate this problem. <em>Trying to improve it makes it worse.</em> This is quite
funny, and increasingly enlightening the more you are forced to confront it.</p>
<p>(To stretch this even further, have a look at the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">無爲</a>, or “inaction”. But that is probably
an unsupportable digression.)</p>
<p>Once you acknowledge that your code will inevitably be an annoyance to someone
at some point, you are liberated to find different ways to make the situation
better, if not the code. Focusing on how to make it easy to delete is a good
route into that thought pattern.</p>
<p>For example, there’s a tendancy to have code extend its tentacles further than
they should go, rather than minding its own business. We try to generalise
beyond the problem that is currently being solved. “We can abstract this out and
then the same code will also solve x, y and z”. “We can prevent this problem
that I have just imagined from ever happening”. “We can make it easier to
achieve a, b and c in future.” Maxims like DRY actively encourage this line of
thinking.</p>
<p>“Make it easy to delete”, on the other hand, takes you down a different path.
“Let’s keep this simple and self-contained”. “Let’s encapsulate this cleanly”.
“Let’s make fewer assumptions about the rest of the application, and let the
rest of the application make fewer assumptions about this part”. These are
healthier ideas to be thinking about as you write new code.</p>
<p>When thinking of “business logic”, we should also think of “mind your own
business logic”. It’s a kind of politeness. Code that is easy to delete tends to
fulfil that.</p>

    <p>When writing React apps or modern JavaScript in general, we often create files with a set of reusable functions or classes. People tend to use default exports in such cases and I'm going to explain, why it's not the best idea to use them.</p>
<span id="more-4175"></span>
<h3>What is a default export?</h3>
<p>The origin of default exports comes from a willingness to replicate the functionality of exporting modules from CommonJS spec to ES6.
So what is a default export basically? Let's have a look at the following piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
export default class SomeComponent {
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>So you can import it into another file like in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>// src/App.js
import SomeComponent from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>After importing it you can use it however you like in the code of <code>App.js</code> file. The important thing to note is that you don't have to use <code>SomeComponent</code> as a name of imported code. It can be literally anything, because there's no strict convention here.</p>
<h3>What is a named export?</h3>
<p>Comparing to the default exports example it looks differently. First of all there's no <code>default</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class SomeComponent {
    ...
}

export const OtherComponent = () =&gt; {
    ...
}

export { SomeComponent };</code></pre>
<p>So you can import it into another file like in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>// src/App.js
import { SomeComponent, OtherComponent } from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>So what are the main differences between both approaches and why you might consider using default exports as a bad practice? The explanation is in the next section.</p>
<h3>The fight</h3>
<p>Let's compare both approaches. I'll try to explain you which of these approaches is better and why.</p>
<h4>Naming convention strictness</h4>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, in the default export section, using default exports and importing into another file, you are not restricted to use a component name (or class name, or whatever) defined in the definition file. While importing you can change its name into anything that you find reasonable.</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
export default class SomeComponent { ... }

// src/App.js
import AnyComponent from './components/SomeComponent'</code></pre>
<p>In case of named exports it's not so easy to use any name for imported piece of code. You are restricted to use names defined in the definition file of a piece code.</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class SomeComponent { ... }

export { SomeComponent };

// src/App.js
import { SomeComponent } from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>But what if you want to change the name of imported component? It's not complicated:</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class SomeComponent { ... }

export SomeComponent;

// src/App.js
import { SomeComponent as AnyComponent } from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>It might be useful when importing components with similar names from different sources.
In the case when you're exporting many components with similar names from many different files, it might be useful to set some sort of namespace for them. Let's take a look:</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class Button { ... }

export const Panel = () =&gt; {};
export const config = {};

export Button;

// src/App.js
import * as UI from './components/SomeComponent';

function App () {
    doSomething(UI.config);

    return (
        &lt;UI.Panel&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;UI.Button /&gt;
        &lt;/UI.Panel&gt;
    )
}</code></pre>
<p>The last way of importing components is commonly used in React environment for importing React library in TypeScript projects:</p>
<pre><code>import * as React from 'react'</code></pre>
<p>In my opinion having multiple ways of importing components versus one unreliable way of importing them is much better in terms of bulding quality apps. You can accomodate imports to your needs.</p>
<h4>Error reporting</h4>
<p>Spotting errors early is extremely important in software development. From my experience using default exports is error-prone solution because you don't know whether a specific piece of code exists in a file.
When I'm using named exports my code editor can early spot errors by checking whether an imported component exists in a source file. I don't have to worry about mistyping component names.
And there we are, typos, these are the most problematic errors, because sometimes they tend to be different to spot a first glance, especially when doing code reviews in apps like Github or Gitlab.</p>
<h4>Long term code mainteinance</h4>
<p>This one is pretty important when building professional apps, not just pet projects that will never get into the public. Choosing the right exporting convention, I mean using named exports over default exports increases code maintainability a lot.
Let's imagine a situation when you're doing a code refactor. You're looking for occurences of a specific component in a codebase. With named exports it's pretty simple, because the imported component name usually is the same as exported one.
With default exports it's not that easy, the component names might differ, sometimes a lot. It can have a different name, the name can have a typo. It's all confusing and makes code mainteinance harder.</p>
<h3>Default exports as necessary evil sometimes</h3>
<p>Sometimes you might be forced to use default exports anyway. Because of other tools that are used when developing React apps. Such tool's developers didn't accomodate it for using code exported using named exports convention. For instance when lazy loading React components. It's a code <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/64" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">design decision made by React team</a>.
At the end you have to write something like the following, in order to lazy load your React component:</p>
<pre><code>// e.g. App.js
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import('./LazyComponent'));

function App {
    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading ...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
                &lt;LazyComponent /&gt;
            &lt;/Suspense&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}</code></pre>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In projects I'm working on I'm using named exports because it makes a codebase more predictable and less error-prone. I prefer getting errors as soon as possible when exporting non-existing components and I love having classes names and component names the same as in the their source files. It helps me a lot in reading the code.</p></section></div>]]>

Through machine learning models built into the operating system, these sounds can be picked up and transmitted to the user in any way that they wish.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png?q=20" width="700" height="1110" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png" width="700" height="1110" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Real-Time Text on the iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bf5">Group FaceTime calls have become more important than ever during the global pandemic, and Apple has added a small but important accessibility feature to them. Now, if a member of a group FaceTime call is using sign language to communicate, their video will be automatically pinned.</p><p id="ab6c">Using computer vision to detect this can be a boon to those with hearing loss, since reading sign language while the screen is moving around can be frustrating.</p><p id="43b4">In addition to this, Apple has made further improvements to its Real-Time Text feature, which is used for text based communication during phone calls. Previously, it was difficult for RTT users to multitask during phone calls, but it no longer requires the full screen.</p><p id="0458">When we think of accessibility on iOS, VoiceOver is often the first to come to mind. This year, VoiceOver received several significant updates, making it even more useful than before. If you aren’t familiar with it, VoiceOver is Apple’s screen reader, available on all platforms, including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.</p><h2 id="ae54">VoiceOver Recognition</h2><p id="aa80">In the past, VoiceOver would require developers to adopt it inside their apps to work well on third-party apps.</p><blockquote><p id="210b">On-device intelligence recognizes key elements displayed on your screen to add VoiceOver support for app and web experiences that don’t have accessibility support built in. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="2717">This year, Apple is tapping into their machine learning technology to semantically detect where and how to use VoiceOver on unsupported apps. This makes virtually all apps natively supported by VoiceOver and increases their accessibility for those with visual impairments.</p><h2 id="6119">Image Descriptions</h2><p id="6f0d">To make VoiceOver even more useful, Apple has used its computer vision library with <em>even more</em> machine learning to detect the contents of an image.</p><blockquote><p id="2f5f">VoiceOver reads complete-sentence descriptions of images and photos within apps and on the web. VoiceOver speaks the text it identifies within images and photos. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="f5ed">Instead of simply stating that an image is present, VoiceOver can now provide detailed descriptions of what’s pictured in an image for more useful information to VoiceOver users. It can also detect text in an image through optical character recognition — another great way that machine learning is being used in the iOS 14 update!</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d6f7">Evidently, there have been plenty of great updates at WWDC20 in accessibility, with even more that weren’t listed here. By releasing a large number of small features, Apple has made their devices more accessible than ever. And, they’ve supercharged many of their flagship accessibility solutions by coupling machine learning technology with them.</p><p id="ab7f">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this tutorial</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="08a6"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

                            <p><strong>If you threw a rock in a room full of African startup founders today</strong>, you would likely hit one offering to give users loans “in just 10 minutes!” via their mobile phones. This should not surprise you; in the past 24 months, we have witnessed a windfall for fintech startups on the continent, with investors <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1211233/how-much-did-african-startups-raise-in-2017-partech-disrupt-africa/">deploying more capital</a> into the sector than anywhere else.</p>
<p>The problem they aim to solve is well-documented. Many consumers in emerging markets operate entirely outside the formal financial ecosystem. They are financially ‘excluded’, and in response, startups hope to harness mobile technology to ‘include’ them in the formal economy. There is little infrastructure to ‘disrupt’, so these startups <a href="https://qz.com/africa/749008/african-fintech-isnt-disrupting-the-financial-industry-its-building-it/">must build it</a>. Take lending. Today’s formal financial systems are designed around predictability; a certain amount of money called “salary” shows up on schedule every month, and stability; this salary comes from the same source [1]. The bank’s risk assessment methods only support giving loans against this consistency. But these conditions are increasingly not true for the average consumer in developing markets. Income is irregular and unpredictable, and most transactions happen offline via cash, other signals must be used to determine creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Fintech startups are betting big that they can accurately figure out who <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> repay unsecured loans, offer those loans to them directly, circumvent the traditional institutions who have failed so far, and <a href="https://www.thesubtext.io/paylaters-personal-piggybank">build new financial ecosystems</a> around themselves.</p>
<p>But one company, <a href="http://mines.io/">Mines</a>, has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/offering-a-white-labeled-lending-service-in-emerging-markets-mines-raises-13-million/">raised a $13 million Series A</a> round to do the exact opposite.</p>
                                        <h3>All Men Are Not Equal</h3>
<p>The dominant narrative in startups today closely tracks the story of the demise of knights. In the Tudor period (1485 - 1603), the English Renaissance brought new philosophy, new art, and new literature. Henry VII took the throne like you would expect a 15th century monarch to: noble knights on horseback engaging in chivalric combat. Being a warrior in those days required years of intense training and mastery of handheld weapons like swords, and axes, and war hammers.</p>
                                                                        
                <div>

                                        <div>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Battle of Bosworth by Philip James de Loutherbourg (1804); This is where Henry VII won the Wars of the Roses.</p>
                    </div>
                                    </div>
                                        <p>But the Renaissance also brought new technology. By the end of Elizabeth I’s reign - the end of the Tudor period - battles were won by siege warfare [2] and projectile weapons like crossbows, cannons, and muskets. Times had changed, but medieval knights could not keep up. The result was that all men were made ‘equal’. Knights and castles that were once impenetrable were now vulnerable to armies of barely-trained peasants with bows and guns. The knights had become [3] ‘priests of a dead religion’, and became obsolete as the grounds of warfare shifted beneath their feet. The things that once made them powerful were now their greatest handicaps (e.g., reinforcing their breastplates to withstand bolts and arrows, would have made them too heavy to carry). They were - to misuse the term as we often do - disrupted.</p>
<p>In the same way, accepted wisdom says [4] the battle between startups and incumbents comes down to whether the startups get distribution before the incumbents gets innovation. “The large corporations are not nimble enough!”, the narrative goes. “Innovate or die!” “Startups will disrupt you, and you will be disrupted!” Mobile, specifically enabled by internet connectivity, is changing the nature of markets, and enabling young companies in Africa compete ‘unfairly’ with old, large institutions. But instead of competing with legacy players, <a href="http://mines.io/">Mines</a> is trying to empower them.</p>

<p>Mines started in 2014 as an AI research project by Stanford Professor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunle-olukotun-80a2735/">Kunle Olukotun</a>, who partnered with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekechi/">Ekechi Nwokah</a>, then a Principal Security Engineer at Amazon AWS, to apply the technology to risk assessment for financial services. Since then, they have integrated with 9Mobile (FKA Etisalat), a Nigerian telco operator to launch <a href="https://www.kwikcash.ng/">Kwikcash</a>, disbursing 4.5 billion naira ($12.5m), with an average ticket size of 12,000 naira ($33) in the past 18 months, according to MD, Nigeria and VP Commercial, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adiasowho/">Adia Sowho</a>, ex Director of Digital Business at 9Mobile. She reckons they are the largest credit platform in Nigeria today. (The company has also penned partnerships with Airtel, and payment processor, Interswitch.)</p>

                                        <h3>Competition By Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Remember the above quote: “the battle [...] comes down to whether the startups get distribution before the incumbents gets innovation”. Mines - in theory, at least - is handing innovation on a platter to banks, telcos, large retailers, and payment processors. The knights are getting guns, too!</p>
<p>By offering them credit-in-a-box, Mines is sacrificing data ownership and a direct relationship with the consumer for faster - better - distribution. But why is this the right approach? Their pitch to their clients is that they [Mines] have built better technology than they [clients] can build, and that they [Mines] have a better product than other consumer players can deliver. If that is true, why not take this ‘better’ product directly to the consumers and beat everyone else? Isn’t this the more valuable position in the value chain?</p>
<p>I posed this question to Adia (she was kind enough to join me for <a href="https://twitter.com/skweird/status/1028975798139670528">a drink</a> a few days ago), and she argued that partnerships are the most effective path to scale in these emerging markets. I see the logic here, and mostly agree. Big corporates own distribution today and <a href="https://twitter.com/skweird/status/1025989325387902977">thus</a>, have most of the leverage. Consumer markets are shallow, and mobile penetration has not yet delivered its great promise of integrating fragmented markets. (We will talk more about this soon.)</p>
<p>But in taking this approach, Mines is also doing two things:</p>
<ul><li>Commoditizing credit scoring and sucking out air for smaller startups, forcing them to look elsewhere for growth. For example, almost all digital credit/fintech apps in Nigeria offer bill payments and airtime purchases as a feature, ensuring that nobody will switch apps to access that feature. The same might happen with credit.</li><li>Creating the opportunity for Mines to create an ecosystem of ecosystems; powering even other fintech startups. This would provide the opportunity for, say, Piggybank or a service to quickly launch a loans product like I <a href="https://www.thesubtext.io/paylaters-personal-piggybank">predicted</a> in Issue #1 (I admit, confirmation bias might be getting to me here...).</li></ul><p>If the above is true, then we will arrive here:</p>

<p>This is the big opportunity. Mines’ many markets are not the countries it plans to expand into (though, the company’s leadership have taken pains to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/offering-a-white-labeled-lending-service-in-emerging-markets-mines-raises-13-million/">communicate</a> that they serve ‘emerging markets’, not ‘Nigeria’ or ‘Africa’), but all the different businesses, each with their own pool of customers, who will operate their own financial ecosystems with Mines at the base. Some of these customers will use products from more than one Mines client, helping Mines get better at identifying good borrowers, and forming credit-scoring infrastructure.</p>
<p>But therein lies my main reservation; by relying on its partners for its data and its growth, Mines both extends its reach and limits its grasp. Today, like most other consumer credit platforms, the company’s flagship product, Kwikcash requires users to have BVN …</p></div></div></div>

At its root we have a Cargo workspace with a <code>binaries</code> crate, and a number of supporting library crates.</p><p>Having our crates in one repo makes them easy to reference in our <code>binaries</code> crate without needing to publish to <a href="https://crates.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crates.io</a> or get too fancy with specifying git dependencies in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>. When the time comes to publish these libraries as open source, it's trivial to break it out into its own repo.</p><a href="#library,-binary,-why-not-both" id="library,-binary,-why-not-both"><h3>Library, binary, why not both?</h3></a><p>We have one main library crate that contains a unified API for talking to hardware, media codecs, network protocols, etc. Outside of that private API, we also have standalone crates in our workspace that we consider candidates for open-sourcing. For example, we’ve written our own actor framework fit for long-running high-throughput actors, as well as our own network protocol for reliable, high-bandwidth, low-latency media streaming.

We use separate binaries for different parts of the tonari system and each of these lives in <code>binaries</code>, a combination library/binary crate. Its library modules contains a set of reusable actors that combine our private API with our actor system, and then a collection of individual binaries that consume these actors and define the plumbing between them.</p><a href="#flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see" id="flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see"><h3>Flags as far as the eye can see</h3></a><p>We make extensive use of feature flags to allow development of our project on different OSes (like Brian's 1970s-era MacBook Pro) or different hardware configurations. This allows us to easily swap out camera hardware without extra runtime checks or using awful <code>sed</code> hacks.

For example, Linux uses <code>v4l2</code> (Video For Linux...2) to access most webcams, but other webcams might have their own SDK.  To compile for platforms that don't use <code>v4l2</code> or when an SDK isn't available for a particular OS, we can put those SDKs behind feature flags and export a common interface.

As a (simplified) concrete example, let's say we have a common camera interface defined as a trait:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> Capture <span>{</span>
    
    <span>fn</span> <span>capture</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>u8<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Let's also say we have three different camera interfaces - <code>v4l2</code>, <code>corevideo</code>, and <code>polaroid.</code> We can make our binaries work exclusively with this trait to be flexible, and we can swap in different implementations of <code>Capture</code> with feature flags.</p><pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = "v4l2")]</span>
<span>mod</span> v4l2 <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> V4l2Capture <span>{</span>

For example, we can have a struct which has a field - <code>video_capture: Box&lt;dyn Capture&gt;</code> which will let us store any type which can <code>Capture</code> from a camera.

An example <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to support the capture implementations we wrote above might look something like …</p></div></div>

            <p><span>2020-05-22</span></p><p>If you use git then you should almost certainly create a <em>global</em> <code>gitignore</code>
file to ignore things like that should almost never be version controlled, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>operating system cruft (<code>.DS_Store</code>, <code>Thumbs.db</code>)</li>
<li>editor tempfiles and non-shared<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> configuration (<code>*.swp</code>, <code>.vscode</code>)</li>
<li>compiled output (<code>*.o</code>, <code>__pycache__</code>, <code>build/</code>)</li>
<li>virtual environments and external dependencies (<code>venv</code>, <code>node_modules</code>)</li>
<li>files you should rename before you commit (<code>Untitled.ipynb</code>)</li>
<li>tooling caches and output (<code>.mypy_cache</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the global gitignore path is <code>~/.config/git/ignore</code> on Unix/macOS
and <code>%USERPROFILE%\git\ignore</code> on Windows.</p>
<p>The syntax is just like that for <code>.gitignore</code> files. Here’s what <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.config/git/ignore">mine looks
like</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dont-misuse-the-repository-gitignore">Don’t misuse the repository <code>.gitignore</code></h2>
<p>You might be tempted to put this stuff in a per-repository <code>.gitignore</code> file. I
think that’s fine (if you <em>insist</em>) for things that are guaranteed to be
created in a working copy of a particular repository (e.g. <code>__pycache__</code> in a
Python project), and thus at particular risk of being merged by collaborators
who don’t have a global gitignore like this. But I much prefer to avoid it for
OS-specific or editor-specific stuff. Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These are things you always want to ignore. Recreating and updating this
file in every repository is a waste of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other users of the repository do not care about the crap created by the
operating system or the editor you happen to be using currently, and you
don’t care about theirs. This stuff should not be in the shared,
version-controlled configuration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow this advice, repository <code>.gitignore</code> files will contain only of
project-specific configuration. They will be shorter and, if you work on a
project with lots of collaborators, they will produce less history churn.</p>
<h2 id="overriding-gitignore">Overriding gitignore</h2>
<p>If you do want to override your global behavior for some reason then you have a
couple of options. You can either manually <code>git add -f</code> the files. Or you can
use gitignore’s <code>!</code> negation syntax in the repository’s <code>.gitignore</code> or
<code>.git/info/exclude</code>.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you’ve ignored <code>foo.txt</code> globally, but you really want to
commit it in a particular repository, you can <code>git add -f foo.txt</code> or put
<code>!foo.txt</code> in a repository <code>.gitignore</code> (which is normally version controlled
and shared with collaborators) <code>.git/info/exclude</code> (which is not, and is
therefore a truly local configuration).</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-need-to-change-coreexcludesfile">You don’t need to change <code>core.excludesfile</code></h2>
<p>You’ll see
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335420/global-git-ignore">advice</a> to do
something like <code>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore</code> to tell git
where you keep your global gitignore. There is no need to do this unless you
object to the perfectly reasonable default location
(<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</code> or <code>%USERPROFILE%\git\ignore</code>).</p>

<p><em>Pont</em> is an online implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle">Qwirkle, a board game by Mindware Games</a>.
It was written for my parents,

<p>Play is split into <strong>rooms</strong>,
which are identified by a three-word code

Within each room,
the game distributes pieces,
enforces the game rules,
and provides a local chat window.</p>
<p>Unusually, it's a web-based multiplayer game <strong>without any Javascript</strong>:
both the client and server are written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
which is compiled into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> to run on the browser.
(There's a Javascript shim to load the WebAssembly module, but I didn't have to write it myself)</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, I'm <em>not a web developer</em>,
so this is probably a weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">outsider architecture</a>
for web applications.
Here's what the system looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/diagram.svg" alt="Diagram"></p>
<p>The system uses <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> for certificates:
both static assets and WebSocket communication are encrypted
between the client and the server.
The game server does not communicate securely with the NGINX proxy,
but if anyone is on the server watching,
I've got bigger problems.</p>
<p>The <code>wasm</code> bundle and <code>pont-server</code> executable are both
written in Rust and managed in the <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont"><code>pont</code> repository</a>.
They both depend on <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs"><code>pont-common</code></a>,
which defines basic types and logic for gameplay
(e.g. so that both the client and server can check whether a move is legal).</p>
<p>The client and server communicate via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a>.
Messages are strongly typed as an <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs#L7-L48"><code>enum</code> in <code>pont-common</code></a>,
serialized using <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>,
and packed into <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">bincode</a>
to be sent as binary WebSocket messages.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The game server using async Rust,
which was... exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ej649l/a_summary_of_the_current_state_of_async_rust/fcw16a9/">"very polite cold war"</a>
going on between the two major (incompatible?) runtimes,
with packages that only work in one or the other</li>
<li>An <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/index.html">infinite</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">supply</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam-channel/0.4.2/crossbeam_channel/">of</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/oneshot/fn.channel.html">options</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-channel-preview/0.3.0-alpha.19/futures_channel/index.html">for</a>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html">channels</a></li>
<li>General confusion between <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/"><code>futures</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/index.html"><code>std::Future</code></a>, and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-util/0.3.5/futures_util/"><code>futures_util</code></a>
(exacerbated by the fact that Googling for things will land you
into a random version of the docs)</li>
<li>Error messages that rival C++ in incomprehensibility</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, the Rust <code>async</code> ecosystem is relatively new,
so most of this can be ascribed to growing pains;
I'm sure that the ergonomics and library situation
will improve over time.</p>
<p>I ended up using the <a href="https://github.com/stjepang/smol"><code>smol</code> runtime</a>
because it's got relatively few dependencies,
and I appreciated that it wasn't trying to own the entire async universe
(unlike Tokio and <code>async-std</code>).</p>
<p>After getting over those hurdles,
the server architecture is relatively straightforward.
A bunch of independent tasks run asynchronously,
communicating to the outside world via WebSockets
and internally via <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/fn.unbounded.html">unbounded MPSC queues</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the server running one game (with two players),
plus one new client who has just connected.  Each rectangle
represents an async task:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/server.svg" alt="Server"></p>
<p>The system has <code>2 + n_players + n_games</code> async tasks running at one time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-level task which accepts incoming connections.</li>
<li>A top-level task which logs the number of active rooms, once per minute</li>
<li>One async task per client connection, which passes messages between the WebSocket connection
and the application's internal queues.</li>
<li>One async task per room, which handles game state</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks each map to a <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/0.1.10/smol/struct.Task.html"><code>smol::Task</code></a>.
(As a small optimization,
the first player's <code>Task</code> handles both the player communication
and running the room, which is why they're both blue in the diagram above)</p>
<p>The server compiles down to a 5 MB static binary.
The whole system is hosted on the smallest VM offered by
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>,
which is a $5/month machine.
I'm looking forward to the inevitable <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">DDOS</a>,
where I can see how well it scales!</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The client is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs">2000 lines of framework-less excitement</a>.
It uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine pattern</a>
to represent the flow of the game,
accepting messages from the server
and updating the state accordingly:
for example, top-level state flows from
<code>Connecting</code> to <code>CreateOrJoin</code> to <code>Playing</code>.</p>
<p>The game board is represented as an SVG;
everything else is standard HTML elements.
In fact, the whole UI is pre-constructed in
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/deploy/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a>
and revealed on demand.</p>
<p>The client has a bit of polish:
Pieces are animated as they move around the board,
and there's an optional color-blind mode,
which adds corner markings to indicate color.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/cb.png" alt="Color-blind mode"></p>
<p>I use direct DOM manipulation
(from the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/"><code>web-sys</code></a> crate)
to control the system.
This exercise has left me appreciating the usefulness of virtual DOMs,
but I didn't want to bring in the complexity of a framework.
(Is there a Rust + <code>wasm</code> version of <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> yet?)</p>
<p>For deployment,
I'm using <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>
and serving the resulting <code>wasm</code> blob from the same server as the other static assets.</p>
<p>The main challenges on the client side were
(of course) dealing with cross-browser compatibility:
Safari, in particular, supports fewer features
and has funky handling of touch events.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>After a bit of a learning curve,
this all worked surprisingly well!</p>
<p>The client side is still a bit messy,
with animations, UI inputs,
and server events all fighting to break the system's invariants.
For example,
there was a nasty bug where dragging the board while
an animation was running could drop the system into an invalid state.</p>
<p>This isn't surprising:
stateful UIs are hard,
which explains the popularity of declarative approaches.
At this point, the client is feature-complete
and hasn't quite collapsed under its own weight,
so I'm not inclined to do any dramatic refactorings.</p>
<p>Rust as a language continues to be great,
despite minor complaints.
I already discussed the async ecosystem above,
and won't dwell on that any further.
On the client side,
there are often impedance mismatches with WebAssembly:
for example, using Rust closures as callbacks
requires
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs#L1189-L1211">cryptic boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, with all of the pieces in place,
making changes is pleasantly fast,
and I trust the compiler to check that I haven't broken anything.</p>
<p>I'm particularly happy with the combination of WebSockets, Serde, and bincode:
having both the client and server process a strongly-typed stream of events
makes things easy to reason about.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I tried writing a Chunked-List data structure and made all the mistakes while using unsafe for that.</p>
<p>I have always avoided C and C++ because I knew I could not be trusted with Pointers.
Rust allows me to keep the high risk code contained into small unsafe { } sections.
I want to write down what mistakes I made inside those sections and how I caught them.
My next blog post will be about the data structure.</p>
<h2 id="not-reading-the-docs">Not reading the docs</h2>
<p>At first I just assumed that the .add() and .offset() methods on pointers would mutate the pointer.
They do not.
Instead they return a new pointer,
which gets dropped silently if you don't use it.
Unlike for example Result, which is must_use annotated.</p>
<pre><span>// wrong code:
</span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> buf </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>];
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> buf[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>u8</span><span>;
</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ ptr.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) }
</span><span>// ptr still points to the first element, with no warnings
</span></pre><pre><span>// better code:
</span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> buf </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>];
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> buf[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>u8</span><span>;
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ ptr.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) }
</span></pre>
<p>I caught that because I had tests and they failed.</p>
<p>So turns out that "better" is not good enough!
The pointer points to the first <em>element</em>
and while going one past the element is not UB,
using it would be.
We need a pointer to the whole array if we want to move around in it.</p>
<pre><span>// correct? code:
</span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> buf </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>];
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>=</span><span> buf.</span><span>as_mut_ptr</span><span>();
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ ptr.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) }
</span></pre>

<h2 id="alignment-issues">Alignment-issues</h2>
<p>In the data structure I was building each chunk would have
a fixed size/capacity and link to the next chunk.
The basic data structure is, assuming 64 bit,  defined as:</p>
<pre><span>pub </span><span>struct </span><span>Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>buf</span><span>: [</span><span>u8</span><span>; 4096 - 2 - 8],
    </span><span>len</span><span>: </span><span>u16</span><span>,
    </span><span>next</span><span>: Option&lt;Box&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
    </span><span>phantom</span><span>: PhantomData&lt;T&gt;,
}
</span></pre>
<p>For initialization I wanted to just pass in a page of memory and write to it</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: [</span><span>u8</span><span>; 4096]) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>Simple right?
Well not so fast.</p>
<p>An array of u8 has an alignment of 1, meaning it can start on any byte of memory.
But the chunk's len field has an alignment of 2, can only start on even bytes.
The next field even has an alignment of 8.
I solved that my requiring the user to pass in an uninitialized chunk that - by definition -
fits the required alignment:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>I caught this using miri.
The new function signature makes getting a Chunk a bit more annoying for the user.
But at least its safe now.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well no. Right now Chunk has an alignment of 8.
What if we want to store something with a bigger alignment?
Segfaults, thats what.</p>
<pre><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C, </span><span>align</span><span>(4096))]
</span><span>pub </span><span>struct </span><span>Chunk&lt;T&gt; { }
</span></pre>
<p>Now its force-aligned to a full page.</p>
<p>This one I actually caught on my own due to thinking about the previous alignment error.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more!
We also need to consider the case of T being bigger than the buffer,
or having an alignment even larger than a whole page.
Sadly at the moment its not very viable to check this at compile-time,
so runtime-checks will have to do.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
        assert!(std::mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>BUF_SIZE</span><span>);
        assert!(std::mem::align_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>4096</span><span>);
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>Now we are good. I hope.</p>
<h2 id="off-by-one">Off-By-"One"</h2>
<p>In the wonderful world of safe rust, everything is done with iterators
and actually indexing anything is a rare sight.
In fact I have come to basically never use manual indexing or offsets in my code.
A bit like a mathematician, seeing actual numbers just feels wrong.</p>
<p>In unsafe rust you will need to manually count with pointers.</p>
<h3 id="pointer-casts">Pointer Casts</h3>
<p>The first mistake I made was actually in safe code, producing a value I then wanted to use in an unsafe block:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
        assert!(std::mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>BUF_SIZE</span><span>);
        assert!(std::mem::align_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>4096</span><span>);
	</span><span>let</span><span> base_ptr </span><span>=</span><span> base.</span><span>as_mut_ptr</span><span>();
	</span><span>// skip to len field:
	</span><span>let</span><span> len_ptr </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ base.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>4096 </span><span>- </span><span>2 </span><span>- </span><span>8</span><span>) };
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>base_ptr is of type *mut MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk<t>&gt;, so I was skipping a few thousand whole chunks,
landing very deep in uninitialized memory.</t></p>
<pre><span>	</span><span>// fixed:
        </span><span>let</span><span> store_ptr </span><span>=</span><span> store.</span><span>as_mut_ptr</span><span>() </span><span>as *mut </span><span>MaybeUninit&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;;
</span></pre>
<p>This is also a bit of a lesson about the scope of unsafe: while the unsafe block itself might be short
everything that touches things that are also relied on in an unsafe context is also very relevant.
In fact The whole module should probably be considered unsafe, because private values are accessible.
For example changing the Chunks length field would lead to undefined behaviour, even though its a "safe" operation.</p>
<h3 id="lengths">Lengths</h3>
<p>Now that I had the ability to create a new Chunk,
I wanted to actually do something with it.
Like for example inserting and removing elements.</p>
<p>An insert is a memcopy, followed by a write,
a remove is a swap followed by a memcopy.</p>
<p>the swap/write are quite straightforward,
but I made some mistakes with the memcopy:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>insert</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>index</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>element</span><span>: T) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...

	</span><span>let </span><span>(_pre, values, _post) </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ </span><span>self</span><span>.buf.</span><span>align_to</span><span>() };
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_source_index </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> values[index] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;;
	</span><span>// pointers are allowed to overshoot an allocation by one,
	// so this is fine.
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_target </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ copy_source.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) };

    	</span><span>let</span><span> remainder </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.len </span><span>-</span><span> index;
	
	</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ std::ptr::copy(copy_source, copy_target, len) };
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>This is an acceptable implementation of insert (with important sanity checks removed for brevity).
Now lets do remove! Basically the same as insert, but with source and target swapped.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>remove</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>index</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...
	</span><span>let </span><span>(_pre, values, _post) </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ </span><span>self</span><span>.buf.</span><span>align_to</span><span>() };
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_target </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> values[index] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;;
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_source </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ copy_target.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) };

	</span><span>let</span><span> remainder </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.len </span><span>-</span><span> index;

	</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ std::ptr::copy(copy_source, copy_target, remainder) };
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>Except that's wrong.</p>
<pre><span>	</span><span>let</span><span> remainder </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.len </span><span>- </span><span>(index </span><span>+ </span><span>1</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>is correct because the value at index has just been removed, that was the whole point!</p>
<p>Found this one with miri.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-unsafe">Dealing with unsafe</h2>
<p>Seeing all the mistakes I made here is some rules I use to try and avoid them:</p>
<h3 id="avoid">Avoid</h3>
<p>Do not use unsafe, if you can somehow avoid it.
If you need something chances are someone else already did it,
just use their code!
You can even help them review it to catch issues.</p>
<p>I have seen people use unsafe for performance reasons,
especially to avoid zeroing something
but it seems to almost never actually make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="read-think">Read &amp; Think</h3>
<p>Read and think about the rules around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/index.html">pointers</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html">uninitialized data</a> in rust.
Also there is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html">Nomicon</a>.</p>
<h3 id="code-carefully">Code Carefully</h3>
<p>I put each unsafe operation into its own block.
Each block gets a comment on why I personally think this operation is sound.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>Write tests for all the unsafe code you create.
Make sure to cover edge-cases,
in my example that would be inserting/removing at the last position.</p>
<h3 id="miri">Miri</h3>
<p>Use miri! Its really useful and easy to get started with.</p>
<pre><span>$</span><span> rustup component add miri
</span><span>$</span><span> cargo miri test
</span></pre>
<p>miri can't test code it does not see,
so make sure your tests actually run the important parts.</p>
<p>Also it won't catch every problem in the code it does see, not a replacement for thinking!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hope you learned something from this post,
maybe about unsafe,
maybe about never trusting code I write cause its got an error every 20 lines.
Or maybe you feel inspired to review the unsafe parts of your favourite library!</p>

<p>I believe Rust is a great language to make SIMD actually usable for ordinary
humans. I’ve played with libraries to making it accessible two years ago (or was
it 3?) and my impression was „Whoa! This is cool. I can’t wait until this is
usable on stable.“ The libraries back then were <a href="https://crates.io/crates/stdsimd"><code>stdsimd</code></a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster"><code>faster</code></a>.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I considered using some SIMD operations in a project in
work. I have some bitsets and wanted to do operations like bitwise AND on them.
If I represent them as bunch of unsigned integers, using SIMD on that makes
sense. But for that, I need to compile on stable, I want the code to be readable
and I don’t want to deal with writing multiple versions of the code to support
multiple levels of SIMD support.</p>

<p>The thing is, while using SIMD on stable is possible, the standard library
offers only the intrinsics. These are good enough as the low-level stuff to
build a library on top, but none of the current ones quite cut it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd"><code>packed_simd</code></a> takes the interface of the previous <code>stdsimd</code> and provides
types like <code>u8x16</code>. But it still requires nightly, because it depends on many
unfinished features (const generics, probably specialization) and these don’t
seem to be ready any time soon.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster"><code>faster</code></a> seems to be dead and not updated. I think it is waiting for what
comes out of <code>packed_simd</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/simdeez"><code>simdeez</code></a> offers only signed ints and is unsound. The interface is a bit
awkward. I’ve eventually tried using this one and it is possible, but I
believe it’s possible to do better.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I think it’s time I roll up my sleeves and give it a shot. So here are my
plans.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-simd-and-why-its-great">What is SIMD and why it’s great</h2>

<p>CPUs are complex beasts and they try to run as fast as possible. For that, they
do a lot of magic ‒ pipelining, speculative execution, memory prefetching, etc.
So, when there’s an instruction to sum up two numbers together, a lot of effort
goes into decoding the instruction, scheduling it onto some execution units,
getting the operands, mapping between real and virtual registers, and only a
little bit into the actual summing. Some clever people decided it makes sense to
introduce instructions that take tuples of operands, do the decoding and all the
other overhead once, but do multiple (2, 4, …) summing operations in parallel,
because it requires only having wider (or more) arithmetic units. So, instead of
doing this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>c1</span> <span>=</span> <span>a1</span> <span>+</span> <span>b1</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>c2</span> <span>=</span> <span>a2</span> <span>+</span> <span>b2</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The CPU can do something like this, but taking the time of only one instruction
(that’s a bit simplifying the things, it’s never that easy with performance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c1</span><span>,</span> <span>c2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>b2</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under optimal circumstances, this allows great speed-ups ‒ depending on how
modern the CPU is and how many „parallel“ operations it can do at once.</p>

<h2 id="why-simd-is-not-so-great">Why SIMD is not so great</h2>

<p>The problem with SIMD is, it’s hard to use, for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are newer processors and older processors. The older ones support only
the older vector instructions, like SSE while newer ones add more modern
instructions like AVX. The more modern support more parallelism so we really
want to use them, but we also really want to support the older CPUs, so when
using SIMD, we end up writing the algorithm multiple times and auto-detecting
at runtime which one to use. That’s annoying. If we want to aim for other
things than just x86-based CPUs, but ARMs too, we end up writing even more
variants.</li>
  <li>It’s usually available only as compiler intrinsics, which are more or less
just the low level CPU instructions wrapped into syntax of function calls. So
working with these is awkward. If we have two arrays of floats, we want to
write simple iterator-based code with <code>.zip</code> or <code>.sum</code>, not worry about
intrinsics. We want the code to be readable, not a submission to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest">obfuscation contest</a>.</li>
  <li>It’s possible to use the vector instructions only when the memory is properly
aligned, the lanes are independent..</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, SIMD is a lot of work to use. It usually is not worth the effort and
it ends up being used only in very core parts of high-performance code, like
video decoders. Compilers try to use SIMD when possible too, but it’s not
perfect because they usually aim at the „common denominator“ instruction set
(what even the oldest CPUs support) and they often fail to prove some of the
properties (like that the size of the slice is a multiple of the number of lanes
or that it’s well aligned).</p>

<h2 id="two-approaches-to-simd-in-rust-libraries-so-far">Two approaches to SIMD in Rust libraries so far</h2>

<p>It’s a pity only very few pieces of code actually take the advantage of the full
power of the CPUs. If Rust made SIMD usage approachable by people instead of the
current dark arts of few selected, it could lead to making ordinary algorithms
and programs faster. If Rust programs were consistently 5% faster than C++
programs because it’s possible to just use SIMD without studying 4 years for it,
it could drive more adoption.</p>

<p>So there appeared two attempts to have an interface which is actually usable in
normal code.</p>

<h3 id="the-vector-types-way">The Vector Types way</h3>

<p>This is what <a href="https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd"><code>packed_simd</code></a> does. It offers bunch of types named like <code>f32x16</code>.
These are almost like <code>[f32; 16]</code> but with the proper alignment. The programmer
can express the intention of having the slices well aligned and multiples of the
lanes, or maybe have pairs (<code>f32x2</code>) when doing 2D graphics. The compiler then
doesn’t have to prove anything, the prerequisites are already guaranteed by the
type.</p>

<p>Under the hood, an operation of <code>f32x16</code> can translate to one <code>512</code>-bit wide
intrinsic, or two <code>256</code>-bit wide, or just <code>16</code> ordinary instructions, depending
on what the target architecture supports.</p>

<p>The downside is, this doesn’t really work well with runtime detection. Doing the
detection inside each <code>+</code> between vectors will be slow, we’ll likely lose more
than we gain by using the wider instructions. So this compiles into the common
denominator too. This is still quite good ‒ both because this can be overridden
when compiling and some older CPUs ignored, and because for example <code>x86-64</code>
always supports at least SSE (<code>128</code> bit wide vectors).</p>

<h3 id="the-native-vector-type">The native vector type</h3>

<p>This is what <a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster"><code>faster</code></a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/simdeez"><code>simdeez</code></a> do. While above we had a set of widths
of each base type (eg. <code>f32x2</code>, <code>f32x4</code>, <code>f32x8</code>, <code>f32x16</code>) and we picked the
one that made sense for our code, which was possibly wider than what the CPU
does, here we get just the one sized exactly for the CPU. So we might get either
<code>f32x4</code> or <code>f32x16</code>, depending for which instruction set we compile for
currently.</p>

<p>In this model, it’s the job of the programmer to write the code in
width-independent way. If you have a long vector of floats, it gets divided into
pairs or quadruples depending on what is being compiled for.</p>

<p>As the whole closure or function is being compiled for a certain architecture,
it allows the compiler to optimize a little bit more. Furthermore, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/simdeez"><code>simdeez</code></a>
compiles for multiple instruction sets at once (using macros) and can dispatch
the right variant ‒ it detects the CPU support and then chooses the appropriate
variant.</p>

<h2 id="my-plan">My plan</h2>

<p>I’d like to combine these two approaches. First, I’d provide marker „Instruction
set“ types, like <code>Sse4_1</code> or <code>Avx</code>. Then there would be a type alias
<code>CompileTime</code> which would be the newest instruction set detected at compile time
(eg. the common denominator).</p>

<p>Then there would be bunch of types like with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd"><code>packed_simd</code></a>, but parametrized
by the instruction set. So <code>f32x16&lt;Avx2&gt;</code> would sum by doing one AVX2
instruction, <code>f32x16&lt;Sse&gt;</code> would do it by 4 SSE instructions and
<code>f32x16&lt;Polyfill&gt;</code> would do it by 16 „ordinary“ instructions. All of them would
still be more or less <code>[f32; 16]</code> under the hood, just with the right alignment
and they would be convertible to each other, just the operations would be done
differently. The bare-bones <code>f32x16</code> would default to be <code>f32x16&lt;CompileTime&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The instruction set markers would have bunch of associated types and constants ‒
the „native“ <code>f32</code> type, native number of bits, etc. An instance of the marker
type would work as a detection token, see below.</p>

<h3 id="safety-of-the-operations">Safety of the operations</h3>

<p>What happens if I do this on an old CPU?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Avx2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Avx2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Avx2</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would explode in nice fireworks of <a href="https://vorner.github.io/undefined.html">undefined behaviour</a>. So this must not
be possible without use of <code>unsafe</code>. But I don’t like libraries that force the
user to use <code>unsafe</code> ‒ sure, some <code>unsafe</code> might be available for special needs,
but ordinary usage should be possible with safe only.</p>

<p>The idea is to gate the <em>creation</em> of these vectors on having detected the CPU
support. Doing detection every time one is created would be slow, but it is
possible to return a token when successfully detecting the support and require
the token as a parameter, something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Returns Result&lt;Avx2, InstructionSetNotAvailable&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>token</span> <span>=</span> <span>Avx2</span><span>::</span><span>detect</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>token</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>token</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dispatch-of-the-best-variant">Dispatch of the best variant</h3>

<p>So we can detect <em>if</em> some instruction set is available and create the
corresponding vectors. But what if we want to let the compiler generate code for
all possible levels and pick the best one at runtime? The answer is generics and
a auto-generated function called into existence by a proc macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[simd_dispatch]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>:</span> <span>InstructionSet</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>:</span> <span>I</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Creates vectors of the CompileTime instruction set</span>
<span>let</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>COMPILE_TIME_TOKEN</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>COMPILE_TIME_TOKEN</span><span>);</span>
<span>// Detects the CPU instruction set, generates the appropriate token and casts</span>
<span>// the parameters appropriately.</span>
<span>sum_dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="iterators">Iterators</h3>

<p>Sometimes we don’t have our data partitioned into vectors. Instead we have a big
slice of the primitive types. The library would provide iterator adapters that
would „cut“ the array into appropriate vectors and return these (or references
to them). There would be multiple variants, eg:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>iter_vectors_unsafe</code>: It would split the slice into the vectors, assuming it
is well aligned and divisible by the number of lanes. This one would be unsafe
to call and produce undefined …</li></ul></section></div></div>

 <p>
  As I am currently right in the middle of a far-reaching rework of Genode's
  low-level GUI stack, I'd like to share a bit of background behind this work:
  the Why, the What, and the How.
 </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="Current_state"></a>
 Current state</h4>
  <p>
   The current incarnation of Genode's low-level GUI-related interfaces is almost
   identical to the very first version that we originally created in 2006.
   Genode has a very strong asymmetric notion of the
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/architecture/Recursive_system_structure.html#Client-server_relationship">relationship</a>
   between client and server components. In this relationship, the client depends
   on the server but the server does not depend on the client.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the lowest level, the framebuffer driver and input driver(s) were
   envisioned as servers that provide the <i>Framebuffer</i> and <i>Input</i> session
   interfaces to higher-level GUI components. From our former academic view, this
   felt natural because those drivers <i>provide</i> <i>resources</i> to other components.
   Provide... serve... server! The nitpicker GUI server uses those low-level
   services to implement a higher level service that ultimately allows for the
   multiplexing of graphics and input.
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/components/Common_session_interfaces.html#Nitpicker_GUI">Nitpicker</a>
   virtualizes the low-level framebuffer and input interfaces while supplementing
   the notions of visible views and input focus. Such a system looks as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_orig.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   The drivers and the nitpicker GUI server are displayed in red because they are
   servers. The GUI applications at the right are nitpicker clients. Nitpicker,
   in turn, is a client of the framebuffer and input drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The client interface of the nitpicker GUI server is success story. A few
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.11#GUI_stack">evolutionary tweaks</a>
   notwithstanding, the original design scales up to the windowed working
   environment of Sculpt OS while retaining the tiny complexity of the nitpicker
   GUI server.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the approach of modelling the framebuffer and input drivers as
   servers is a dead end, for the following reasons.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers are sometimes extremely complex. When looking at the complexity of
     the Intel framebuffer driver (ported from the Linux kernel) for example, it
     feels foolish to trust that it won't fail. Because the nitpicker GUI server
     depends on the liveliness of the driver, however, the well-being of the
     driver is on the critical path for the entire GUI stack and all GUI
     applications.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     It is impossible to transparently restart or replace the driver at runtime
     without also restarting the GUI stack and - transitively - all GUI
     applications. This is because the nitpicker GUI server is connected as a
     client to the drivers. The connections are like a life supply for the GUI
     server. Cutting those would ultimately kill the GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding secondary displays is rather difficult because this would require
     nitpicker to know what framebuffer servers are out there and to request
     multiple framebuffer connections. Adding such a protocol would inflate
     the complexity of nitpicker.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <h4>
 <a name="Inverting_interfaces"></a>
 Inverting interfaces</h4>
  <p>
   To overcome these limitations, we must break the dependency of the GUI
   server from the drivers, like illustrated here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_next.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   In this scenario, the GUI server no longer <i>uses</i> the drivers, but the drivers
   use the GUI server. The relationship is reversed. Only the nitpicker GUI
   server remains red. Of course, the drivers cannot talk to nitpicker GUI
   server via nitpicker's regular client interface. Instead, two new interfaces
   enter the picture:
  </p>
  <div><dl>
   <dt>The <i>Capture</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Framebuffer</i> session interface. It allows a client to obtain pixel data
     from the server. From the GUI server's perspective, a framebuffer driver
     is like a frame capturing device - which it is.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>The <i>Event</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Input</i> session interface. In contrast to a input session, which allows
     a client to obtain input events, an event session allows a client to
     induce input events. Nitpicker is an event server that consumes the input
     events from the driver(s).
    </p>
   </dd>
  </dl></div>
  <p>
   The benefits of this approach are manifold:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The low-complexity GUI server remains as the only component that must never
     fail, which makes the GUI stack much more resilient compared to today.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Since the nitpicker GUI server no longer depends on the drivers, it can be
     started before the drivers are running, speeding up the boot time of
     graphical scenarios. In scenarios with rigid power management, we can remove
     the graphics driver - and switch off the graphics device - all while the GUI
     server and all GUI applications stay intact.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers can be restarted anytime. From the perspective of the nitpicker
     GUI server, this looks like a client disconnect and connect. Drivers
     can also be replaced at runtime, e.g., swapping out the VESA and Intel
     drivers.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Connecting more than one driver to the nitpicker GUI server becomes
     conceptually simple. This clears the path towards multi-head support.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The new capture session interface of the nitpicker GUI server would be
     the right hook for implementing screenshot/screencast applications, or a
     remote desktop server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Analogously to capture devices, input devices can enter and leave the
     system at any time without disruption, which will allow for the fine-grained
     management of USB HID devices. Think of plugging a new HID device to
     your Sculpt system. A new USB device would show up.
     The user can deploy the matching HID driver with the option of routing the
     event session of the driver to the system GUI server. Isn't that wonderful?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   What is the downside? <i>It is a lot of work!</i> This leads us the following
   section.
  </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="The_plan"></a>
 The plan</h4>
  <p>
   Turning the low-level session interfaces upside down is an invasive operation
   that must be carried out in several steps, each yielding an intermediate
   consistent state.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     We start off with some low-risk <b>cosmetic</b> changes, namely the renaming
     of the "Nitpicker" session interface to "Gui" session. The strange
     branding of the session interface after a particular implementation is a
     relic from the early days. This
     <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3778">change</a> has already
     entered Genode's master branch.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Consistently use <b>32-bit RGB</b> as pixel format by all drivers and
     applications. This is a long-standing feature request that eliminates
     the need for color-space conversions and generally improves the output
     quality.
     It is quite labor-intensive because it requires me testing many
     different hardware platforms covering the drivers vesa_fb_drv, fb_sdl,
     intel_fb_drv, imx53_fb_drv, imx8_fb_drv, rpi_fb_drv, boot_fb_drv,
     omap4_fb_drv, exynos5_fb_drv.
     This <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3784">change</a> has already
     progressed well.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Capture</b> session <b>interface</b>.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Implementing the <b>capture service</b> in the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introduce a <b>nitpicker</b> option to choose the framebuffer <b>back end</b> between
     the use of a requested framebuffer session (as done today), the use of a
     capture client for the pixel output, or the use of another GUI server
     (for stacking multiple instance of nitpicker).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Turn "Framebuffer" <b>drivers</b> into "Capture" clients, covering all the
     drivers mentioned above. Shoveling code. Adjusting all existing
     scenarios to use nitpicker's capture service.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Pruning</b> the remaining use of the <b>framebuffer client</b> interface.
     In fact, when done, I want to remove the <tt>Framebuffer::Connection</tt>
     completely. This will require the reworking of the terminal, MESA back end,
     several tests, and the liquid_framebuffer. In the process, I hope to largely
     eliminate the use cases of the nit_fb (now called gui_fb) component so
     that this component can be removed in the end.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Turning</b> a few other <b>framebuffer clients</b> into "Capture" servers, in
     particular test-framebuffer, fb_bench, and test-driver_manager.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Removal</b> of the "Framebuffer" <b>session interface</b>, retaining the interface
     merely as a part of the GUI session.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Event</b> session <b>interface</b> and adding its implementation
     to the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding a new <b>event_filter component</b> taking the place of the input_filter.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     With the structural changes done, it would be time for optimizations.
     As a prerequisite for tear-free animations, the <b>frame buffering</b> will be
     moved from the clients into the nitpicker GUI server. At first, this will be
     transparent to most clients. The subsequent removal of client-side buffering
     is second independent step. As another optimization, I plan to go though all
     places that employed the dithering of pixels.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Of those topics, the rework of the framebuffer drivers is certainly the most
   elaborate one. I'm considering to drop the Exynos5 and OMAP4 drivers.
   Even though I strive for replacing the input session interface by the new
   event session interface, the scope of the task of reworking the input drivers
   is not yet completely tangible to me.

<p>The last couple of days I picked up on my ELK Stack a couple thousands of SSH Brute Force Attacks, so I decided I will just revisit my SSH Server configuration, and change my SSH Port to something else for the interim. The dashboard that showed me the results at that point in time:</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rbekker/image/upload/v1539292443/kibana-failed-ssh-auth_udkxkl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I decided I actually would like to setup a SSH Honeypot to listen on Port 22 and change my SSH Server to listen on 222 and capture their IP Addresses, Usernames and Passwords that they are trying to use and dump it all in a file so that I can build up my own password dictionary :D</p>
<h2 id="sshconfiguration">SSH Configuration:</h2>
<p>Changing the SSH Port:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>
<p>Change the port to 222:</p>
<pre><code>Port 222
</code></pre>
<p>Restart the SSH Server:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</code></pre>
<p>Verify that the SSH Server is running on the new port:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo netstat -tulpn | grep sshd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:222            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      28838/sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/random-robbie/docker-ssh-honey">random-robbie</a>, as he had everything I was looking for on Github.</p>
<p>Setup the SSH Honeypot:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/random-robbie/docker-ssh-honey
$ cd docker-ssh-honey/
$ docker build . -t local:ssh-honepot
$ docker run -itd --name ssh-honeypot -p 22:22 local:ssh-honepot
</code></pre>
<p>Once people attempt to ssh, you will get the output to stdout:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker logs -f $(docker ps -f name=ssh-honeypot -q) | grep -v 'Error exchanging' | head -10

<h2 id="savingresultstodisk">Saving results to disk:</h2>
<p>Redirecting the output to a log file, running in the foreground as a screen session:</p>
<pre><code>$ screen -S honeypot
$ docker logs -f f6cb | grep -v 'Error exchanging' | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}' &gt;&gt; /var/log/ssh-honeypot.log
</code></pre>
<p>Detach from your screen session:</p>
<pre><code>Ctrl + a; d
</code></pre>
<p>Checking out the logs</p>
<pre><code>$ head -3 /var/log/ssh-honeypot.log

4x.7.2x.1x root HowAreYou
4x.7.2x.1x root Sqladmin
</code></pre>
<p>Leaving this running for a couple of months, and I have a massive password database:</p>
<pre><code>$ wc -l /var/log/honeypot/ssh.log
54184260 /var/log/honeypot/ssh.log
</code></pre>
<p>That is correct, 54 million password attempts. 5372 Unique IPs, 4082 Unique Usernames, 88829 Unique Passwords.</p>

<p><em>Your success is inversely related to the number of excuses you’ve made in your life.</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/8238/8597076899_95d792f7e6_z.jpg?resize=525%2C525&amp;ssl=1" alt="No Excuses" width="525" height="525" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/8238/8597076899_95d792f7e6_z.jpg?resize=525%2C525&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Ahhhh, the wisdom of The Simpsons.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s face it, we all make excuses. Excuses are a part of life. But do they really help? </p>



<p>Of course not. </p>



<p>There is a fundamental imbalance in the economy of excuses: everyone likes to make excuses. Nobody likes to listen to them. You can fashion excuses into “reasons.” You can try to justify them to everyone and anyone all day long. The first excuse might gain you a little leeway, but each subsequent excuse will quickly dismantle your reputation. People begin to tune you out after a while.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, your reliance on excuses will hold you back more than the “excuses” themselves.</p>



<p>The difference between taking your life to the next level and wallowing in mediocrity is simply the ability to identify and kill your excuses when they arise.</p>



<p>If you disagree, flip it around and ask yourself:</p>



<ul><li>How much patience do you have for people who overpromise and underdeliver?</li><li>How much money have you given to businesses that continually fall short of expectations? How much sympathy do you have for their excuses?</li><li>How successful is the kid in school who always claims his dog ate his homework?</li><li>If you’ve ever run a business, how many opportunities would you give an employee who gave you an earful of excuses every single time they were late?</li></ul>



<p>Need I say more?</p>



<h4>There’s Always Two Sides to the Coin</h4>



<p>I used to be a huge manufacturer of excuses. In school, especially in my underachieving college days, I would come up with every excuse in the book as to why I didn’t get an assignment in on time. “I wasn’t feeling well,” “I didn’t get that email,” “I had two other tests to study for,” etc. I felt that my excuses were always enough to let me off the hook. But they were really just keeping me from achieving my full potential.</p>



<p>When I began managing restaurants, I soon came to understand how my professors must have felt years earlier. One restaurant I managed was near a college campus. 75% of the employees were college students. <em>You can imagine the list of excuses I received</em>. The funny thing is, when a student/employee gives an excuse, they think they are the only one with that particular excuse. But when you become the recipient of excuses, you begin to develop a sixth sense for which excuses are legit and which ones are not. Needless to say, the best opportunities and the best shifts went to those who made the least excuses.</p>



<p>Excuses given to others are enough to close off a world of opportunities to you. But the most harmful excuses are the ones you tell yourself. This is because the recipient—YOU—will almost always accept them. “I’m too tired to exercise,” “I don’t have time to mow the lawn,” “I’m too broke for a gym membership,” “Okay, just this one time,” “I can’t because…” Excuses become habits. Habits become destiny.</p>



<p>My point is simple. If you want to enjoy more success, if you want to get that raise or promotion at work, if you want to take on more responsibility, if you want more authority, hold yourself to a higher standard and kill your excuses.</p>



<h4>Here are seven strategies I’ve used to kill my excuses:</h4>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Take ownership</strong>. Face it, your excuses are used to get out of taking responsibility for something. Most employees make excuses and they wonder why they were passed up for promotion. Set yourself apart from the crowd. Take ownership of your shortcomings and own the solutions. Every position of leadership I’ve attained resulted from a consistent ownership habit. No excuses–doing what it takes to get the job done. It sounds easy. It’s even easier in practice. Act like the owner, think like the owner, and soon you will be an owner.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create solutions</strong>. Instead of waiting for others to solve a problem, instead of waiting for a problem to magically solve itself, instead of hoping for sympathy from someone depending on you, find the solution. Don’t have an hour to devote to writing? Wake up earlier or stay up later. Don’t have the energy to work out? Start by putting on your running shoes. Running late? Prioritize and get back on schedule. There is always a solution for every problem.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Commit to a process</strong>. If the excuses are a recurring event, like why you aren’t hitting the gym, or why you can’t seem to get into a meditation habit, develop a system. For me, I write down the three MITs I want to accomplish the night before, so when I wake up I can hit the ground running. To develop consistency, I’ve used the Jerry Seinfeld Strategy of marking each day on a calendar with an X for when I performed a particular habit. Jerry’s habit was writing jokes. The idea is simply to not break the chain of X’s.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Cultivate a mindset of positivity</strong>. Our excuses usually originate from negativity, or things we don’t want to do. Begin to look at that “chore” in a positive light, or else you’ll always have an excuse for not doing it. For example, instead of putting off mowing the lawn because you’re tired, look at it as a way to get outside, get some fresh air, and get a little workout in.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Think about WHY</strong>. When you identify your reasons behind doing something, you suddenly eliminate the need for excuses. You’ll be more likely to follow through on what you need to do when you understand the true meaning behind it.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Do more of what you genuinely enjoy</strong>. I had no excuses regarding taking a road trip. I don’t have to make excuses regarding my daily writing habit. I don’t make excuses regarding kettlebell exercises and pull-ups. The more you can steer your life towards more of what you enjoy and less of what you don’t, the more likely you will find success on that path.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Read about someone you admire and how they handle failure</strong>. What was their philosophy on excuses? For me, in the last several years it had been (and still is) Kobe Bryant and his work ethic. Some people will make you want to run through a brick wall. He was one of them.  And if that’s not enough, when you think something is impossible for you to do, look up <a href="https://www.kyle-maynard.com/">Kyle Maynard</a>.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Bonus: Make excuses. Then do it anyway</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Hold yourself to a higher standard. Kill your excuses.</p>

 		<p>“Use managed services.”</p>
<p>If there was one piece of advice I wish I could shout from the mountains to all cloud engineers, this would be it.</p>
<p>Operations, especially operations at scale, are a hard problem. Edge cases become commonplace. Failure is rampant. Automation and standardization are crucial. People with experience running software and hardware at this scale tend to be rare and expensive. The mistakes they’ve made and situations they’ve learned from aren’t easy to pick up.</p>
<p>When you use a managed service from one of the major cloud vendors, you’re getting access to all the wisdom of their teams and the power of their automation and systems, for the low price of their software.</p>
<p>A managed service is a service like AWS relational database service, Google Cloud SQL or Azure SQL Database. With all three of these services, you’re getting best of breed configuration and management for a relational database system. There’s configuration needed on your part, but hard or tedious tasks like setting up replication or backups can be done quickly and easily (take this from someone who fed and cared for a mysql replication system for years). Depending on your cloud vendor and needs, you can get managed services for key components of modern software systems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>File storage</li>
<li>Object caches</li>
<li>Message queues</li>
<li>Stream processing software</li>
<li>ETL tools</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that these are all components of your application, and will still require developer time to thread together.)</p>
<p>You should use managed services for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s going to be operated well. The expertise that the cloud providers can provide and the automation they can afford to implement will likely surpass what you can do, especially across multiple services.</li>
<li>It’s going to be cheaper. Especially when you consider employee costs. The most expensive AWS RDS instance is approximately $100k/year (full price). It’s not an apples to apples comparison, but in many countries you can’t get a database architect for that salary.</li>
<li>It’s going to be faster for development. Developers can focus on connecting these pieces of infrastructure rather than learning how to set them up and run them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A managed service doesn’t work for everyone. If you need to be able to tweak every setting, a managed service won’t let you. You may have stringent performance or security requirements that a managed service can’t meet. You may also start out with a managed service and grow out of it. (Congrats!)</p>
<p>Another important consideration is lock-in. Some managed services are compatible with alternatives (kubernetes services are a good example). If that is the case, you can move clouds. Others are proprietary and will require substantial reworking of your application if you need to migrate.</p>
<p>If you are working in the cloud and you need a building block for your application like a relational database or a message queue, start with a managed service (and self host if it doesn’t meet your needs). Leverage the operational excellence of the cloud vendors, and you’ll be able to build more, faster.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>                                
                                    <div> 
                                        <p>As someone who grew up throughout the 90's and 00's, some of my fondest memories stem from progressive advancements in internet and computing technologies.  Upgrading from Dial-Up internet to DSL was a grand event in our house.  I remember my brother and I fighting over the computer day in and day out to play games like Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory, which was released in 2003. (I'm convinced that this will be the all-time best FPS game ever created.)  At around the same time, we upgraded to one of the best Dell computer's available at the time. It had 512MB of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor.  This was a major upgrade from our Compaq Celeron, which had something like 64MB of RAM. <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/MV5BOGFmNjMzZTktNDg2ZS00ZjllLTlkMTAtZTAzMzBkN2UyMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU3MzI1NzI@._V1_.jpg" alt="Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory"></p>

<p>Eventually, the grandeur of DSL faded as the rest of the world began to adopt Cable and Fiber internet.  It wasn't until I briefly moved to Philadelphia that I was finally able to experienced what I had been missing out on.  In college I lived in a neighborhood that was one of Verizon's first Fios builds.  I was absolutely blown away by the 25 Mbps connection.  This was in 2009. I'm amazed that over a decade later, in 2020, some households still don't have access to cable or fiber internet yet.</p>

<p>Like many of our customers do now, I could never figure out why it was so difficult to get us fiber service.  The cable is cheap, just throw it up on a pole and give me internet! Right?  Well, not so fast... <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/1849761.jpg" alt="Fiber Spaghetti"></p>

<p>A quick overview of how utility services are run and the challenges involved...</p>

<p>As most people know, there are primarily two ways to deliver utility services to a home or business.  Aerial and underground.  Water, gas, and sewer are always serviced underground for obvious reasons.  Electric, telephone, cable, and fiber have the ability to either be above or below ground.</p>

<h3 id="aerial">Aerial.</h3>

<p>As with anything else, aerial has pro's and con's.</p>

<p>The pro's are primarily upfront costs (this is debatable) and speed of deployment (this is also debatable).</p>

<p>The con's are that contrary to it being cheaper to physically deploy, the pole owners generally charge up-front make ready fee's.  These fees can range from $0 to upwards of $50,000/mile.  It's essentially pay to play.  If we want to attach to 50 poles, the pole owner might determine that 10 of those poles are old and need to be replaced before we can attach to them.  Rather than fork up the cash themselves, they'll force us to pay to replace their poles in order to approve the attachment.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are the annual pole fee's.  Depending on your agreement, we've seen pole fee's ranging anywhere from $7/pole per year all the way up to $43/pole per year with 10% annual increases (I'm looking at you PPL.  This ridiculous rate was purely intended to keep us from attaching to their poles, IMO.  It's impossible to make money with these rates). <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-22.04.34.png" alt="Pole Rates"></p>

<p>Another con is that even though installing the cable on poles is faster, it usually takes the pole owner around 6 months just to review applications and to determine make ready requirements and costs.  As an example, if we have fiber on a pole that's 1 pole short from being able to service your house, it would take at least 6 months just to run fiber to that one additional pole. So close, yet so far.</p>

<h3 id="underground">Underground.</h3>

<p>Like aerial, underground has its own list of pro's and con's.</p>

<p>When you install a service underground, you own it for life.  There are no annual fee's.  You pay one time to install it and you're set for life.  This sounds like a pro, but it's also a con.  When we run metro conduit, it generally costs us between $15-25/ft (not including customer drops).  For the sake of argument, let's assume we're at the high-end of our costs.  If we install 1,000ft of conduit, that's $25,000 that we need to pay out of pocket upfront.  Some blocks have upwards of 30 customers, but others have as little as 5.  Let's average it out at 20 customers per block, that's $1,250 upfront per customer, assuming we get every single customer.  Conservatively, we're initially looking at a 50% take rate.  This could grow to 100% overtime, but we never make that assumption. So that's $2,500/customer.  Imagine spending $2,500 per house/building and then have them tell you that your $69/m service is too expensive.  Generally speaking, we won't do a street unless our numbers look better than this, but this is a realistic scenario as we scale and get access to cheaper capital, etc.</p>

<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/enorthampton02.jpg" alt="Underground Construction Restoration"></p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>Cost issues aside, there are a number of other hurdles one needs to get past just to begin the process of building out a network.  You'd think that risking everything you have in an effort to bring your local economy into the 21st Century would be a welcome sight.  That's what I thought too; was I wrong.  While there are plenty of supporters (I truly appreciate you all), there are just as many, if not more, critics.</p>

<p>We've been fortunate enough to have had a handful of people get behind us overtime and give us a shot.  I'm sure others haven't had it so easy.  I know this because even after we've become an established player in our city throughout the past 4 years, neighboring townships and municipalities haven't been as opened armed to welcome us into their communities as I had anticipated or would have liked.</p>

<p>I'll go into more detail on small government policies that really hamper our ability to deploy underground later below.</p>

<h3 id="toomanyopinions">Too Many Opinions</h3>

<p>I'm generally a big fan of individual citizens trying to make an impact in their communities.  However, in too many cases these contributions seem to be made in the form of unproductive complaints rather than productive feedback or action.  Far too many people have a say in things that they probably shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case A.</em></strong></p>

<p>A new customer had recently signed an agreement with us to run fiber into their building.  This is a non-profit who's members are selflessly donating their time to restore a landmark in the community.  Upon receiving their signature, I notified the city that we would be pulling a permit to connect the building in question to our underground network.  They said okay; that was that.  Our nearest existing hand hole is approximately 90ft to the right of the new customer's property; in front of another property.  As a courtesy, I notified the manager of that establishment to let her know that we would be performing work over the weekend, from Friday into Saturday.  They're closed Saturday and Sunday so I had assumed they would appreciate the notice and possibly even sign up with us.  The project would involve removing 90ft of sidewalk, running conduit, and then restoring the sidewalk with brand spankin' new concrete.  The total timespan that this would occur, from when our shovel hit the ground to having new sidewalks in place, would be 48 hrs.  The response that I received from a member of their organization made me facepalm.</p>

<p><img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-18.53.55-copy.png" alt="Sidewalk Issues"></p>

<p>Not long after receiving this email, I became aware that they didn't even own the building in question, nevermind the sidewalk.  They lease it.  This was eventually "resolved" after a series of negotiations between the non-profit's president and the establishment in question.  Often times we aren't as lucky.</p>

<p>We initially planned to have this new customer installed within a week of them signing the contract.  Now it will end up being around 2 months from start to finish.  Long story short, I learned my lesson in trying to be courteous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case B.</em></strong></p>

<p>Last year we were installing conduit for our fiber optic network.  There were countless instances where people would literally stop their cars, roll down their windows, and yell profanities at us.  In what world is that acceptable behavior for an adult? I can't imagine being so far off my rocker that I would feel the need to yell at a bunch of construction workers trying to build a fiber optic network (not that they had any idea what we were doing).  If these are the types of people influencing decisions, there's something wrong.</p>

<p>City workers have a tough job fielding complaints from people like this and I commend them for it.  It shouldn't affect policy though.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case C.</em></strong></p>

<p>In another incident that took place not long, maybe a day or two, after <em>Case B</em> above.  A local store owner came back to us as we're swinging pick axes in 95 degree heat telling us we need to hurry up and we should hire more workers.  "My customers keep calling saying there's no where to park."  Mind you, we're standing right next to a massive parking lot that is approximately 1/3rd full.  I made my best attempt to kindly explain that paying 3 guys to stand around a hole to watch one person hand-dig to expose a utility isn't going to make our work go any faster.  I don't think he liked my response.</p>

<h3 id="theconsequences">The Consequences</h3>

<p>In many cases, resident complaints are justified.  Utility providers need to be held accountable for shitty restoration work.  However, the way in which bad restoration work is being combated is counter productive.  There has been a huge increase in curb-to-curb restoration requirements by local governments.  Essentially what these rules state is that anytime a utility cuts asphalt beyond a predetermined length, say 100ft, they are then responsible for replacing the entire road surface from the curb on the left side of the street to the curb on the right side of the street.  I believe some municipalities are also trying to introduce these measures to offload the costs of repaving roads themselves, similar to how pole owners force you to replace their aging utility poles under their make-ready requirements.  (One municipality told me as much when I attended a local council meeting in an effort to get them to waive this ridiculous ordinance for us.)</p>

<p>These policies will ultimately do more harm than good.  For us, these are the one and only thing preventing us from providing superior fiber internet services in these areas.  Forcing curb-to-curb asphalt …</p></div></div></div>

<p>CTMU is a metaphysical theory of the universe by Christopher Langan, a man with the highest recorded IQ in the world. The crux of CTMU is that the universe is both procedure and object, code and data, function and parameter, effectively a self-modifying process that targets itself. The SCSPL<a href="http://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Self-Configuring_Self-Processing_Language">[0]</a> is what CTMU terms as the BIOS or Operating System of our universe – it stands for Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language.</p>



<p>My main hypothesis is that the SCSPL is precisely the general solution to the Busy Beaver problem. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">[1]</a></p>



<p>Assuming our universe is infinite, its `cosmic egg`, the program that represents our universe, is the solution to $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty} BB(n)}$</p>



<p>BB visits as many possible states as possible before halting. In simple terms it asks: Find the longest running program that doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop. Classically, BB is a challenge for Turing machines. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">[2]</a> Turing machines are notoriously hard to program because they do not distinguish between code and data.</p>



<p>We can and should extend BB to Von Neumann machines <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_machine">[3]</a>, like the one that you are reading this post on right now. Von Neumann machines differ from Turing machines because they make a distinction between code and data by reserving memory for each. Upon execution of a program on a VN, it is simply copied from the hard drive to reserved, read-only memory. The instruction pointer of the CPU, known as EIP, points to memory location of the code to execute and simply increments every time the CPU runs a line of code. Loops and conditional statements are accomplished by adding or subtracting from EIP. This is known as jumping. The important takeaway here is that the code is static and unchanging and in turn, it resides in reserved memory that must remain static and unchanging.</p>



<p>In a VN, a memory module of n bits, has 2^n possible states. Assuming one of these is a halting state, we could in theory write a program that would run through all or almost all of these states. However, we would almost certainly need to scrap the paradigm of storing programs in unchanging, read-only memory. For example, if our machine has 100 bits of memory, and our program takes up 90 bits, we could only hope to write a program that iterates through all possible states of the 10 non-reserved bits, a measly 1024 states. This is a far cry from the enormous size of the memory space of all 100 bits ~ 12676506002 28229401496703205376.</p>



<p>Self modifying programs dwarf static programs in runtime. This is because the entire memory is used for the state space – not just a small data section. Unfortunately, other than in the niche underground culture of blackhats writing viruses and worms, the principles of polymorphic code are poorly understood. We barely understand how to write self-modifying programs and neither Mathematics nor Computer Science have researchers or categories of study dedicated to elucidating it.</p>



<p>The lack of knowledge on self-modifying programs is sad in so many ways but one practical application really hurts all of humanity: compression. Self-modifying programs are actually the most concise family of programs. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">[4]</a> This is so much so, that a self-modifying program is what generates our entire universe.</p>



<p>If you care about having a real, tangible model of physics that rivals string theory and the standard model, then solving BB is imperative and urgent! Our place in the universe, in space and time, is many many steps into BB(∞). In order to peer back into the ontological basis of reality, our only solution is BB. Too many non-linear changes have occurred since the initial Big Bang, or BB, coincidence? I think not 😉</p>



<p>If there is a multiverse, BB would run through it. It truly is the holy grail representing the universe of ALL possibilities. I could go on, and talk about computational elements of self-modifying programs that reinforce themselves and create stable motifs, ala gliders in cellular automata, but I think this is enough for you to understand: BB is the code for our universe.</p>



<p>Let’s solve BB generally, for VN machines, and supplant string theory, particle physics, and bring the ontological computational truth back to reality on Earth. It is our duty.</p>

<p><strong>It has been a long journey!</strong> I was silent for a while, haven’t posted regularly on my blog. But don’t worry, I’m fine. Instead, I took this situation around coronavirus and focused on writing a book “<em>Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU</em>”. I started writing this book almost a year ago, so I’m happy I finally can show something to the people. Right now, the <strong>early draft is ready and I’m welcoming everybody to review the book and maybe even add something to it</strong>. I know a lot of people are struggling right now, so I decided to make the book <strong>FREE</strong> for all. Eventually, everyone will be able to download PDF version of it.</p>

<p><strong>Why I started it?</strong> I started this book with one simple goal in mind: educate developers to better understand performance of their applications running on modern HW. Most of developers are used to look no further than the source code of their application without trying to understand performance implications of the changes they make. I know for many of us what happens under the hood is sort of black matter. I know it’s hard, but hopefully with this book, performance world of modern HW will become more accessible.</p>

<p><strong>What is the book about?</strong> Have you ever debated with a coworker about performance of a certain piece of code? Then you probably know how hard it is to predict which version is going to work best. With so many moving parts inside the modern processors even a small tweak to the code can trigger significant performance change. Besides all its complexity, HW has many features that support performance analysis. That’s right, CPUs are capable of telling us what performance bottlenecks are and where they occur. Thus, the book focuses on how your code looks like from the CPU perspective and provides recipes for HW specific optimizations. The core of the book is centered around how to find the right place in the code to improve performance.</p>

<p>Below I present the sweetest parts of the book contents:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1. Introduction
2. Measuring Performance
3. CPU Microarchitecture 101
4. Terminology And Metrics In Performance Analysis
5. Performance Analysis Approaches
  5.1. Code Instrumentation
  5.2. Tracing
  5.3. Workload Characterization
  5.4. Sampling
  5.5. Static Performance Analysis
  5.6. Compiler Optimization Reports
6. CPU Features For Performance Analysis
  6.1. Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMAM)
  6.2. Last Branch Record (LBR)
  6.3. Processor Event-Based Sampling (PEBS)
  6.4. Intel Processor Traces (PT)
7. Source Code Tuning For CPU
  7.1. Data-Driven Optimizations
  7.2. CPU Front-End Optimizations
  7.3. CPU Back-End Optimizations
  7.4. Optimizing Bad Speculation
  7.5. Other Tuning Areas
8. Optimizing Multithreaded Applications
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Who is this book for?</strong> Primarily, this book is written for developers working in performance critical projects. This includes the following areas: High performance computing (HPC), High Frequency Trading (HFT), GameDev, Data Centers (Facebook, Google, etc), and other areas. But I hope it will be useful for any C++ developer: you can use this book to learn performance analysis which will stack up nicely with other skills you might have. All examples in the book are written in C/C++, but to the large extent they are applicable to any native programming language (like C, C++, Rust, Go and even Fortran). While this book is fairly low-level, I hope, it will be accessible even to developers that are just starting performance related work.</p>

<p>I gave this book all my knowledge and experience and I’m eager to share it with community. I decided to make this book open to everyone and <strong>I welcome everyone to review and contribute to the book</strong>. I hope, this way we can combine best performance practices and expertise from people in different areas.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的读者<a href="https://interconnected.blog/china-scale-technology-sandbox/#chinese-version-below">请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>China’s Internet economy is often viewed by many people through the lens of U.S.-China relations or China’s domestic structure. Some times those lenses are useful, other times not so much.</p><p>One aspect, where applying a geopolitical lens is <em>not </em>useful, is how the Chinese Internet’s sheer size has become a technology sandbox for creating and battle-testing new solutions to solve new challenges at scale, which few other economies can replicate. This often-overlooked characteristic has already allowed many useful technologies to mature.</p><h2 id="buy-buy-buy">Buy, Buy, Buy</h2><p>The most straightforward way to grasp the scale of China’s online economy is through e-commerce, serving its <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265140/number-of-internet-users-in-china/">roughly 900 million Internet users</a>. Even though other sectors are also growing -- e.g. shared economy, IoT, autonomous driving, facial recognition, SaaS, etc. -- e-commerce has been around the longest with the cleanest numbers to compare and interpret.</p><p>China’s e-commerce landscape is primarily driven by two major shopping holidays: Singles’ Day and 618. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles%27_Day">Singles’ Day</a> is the more high-profile one, a “manufactured” shopping day created by Alibaba that happens on November 11 every year. 618 is less well-known outside of China, though still impressive in terms of scale. It’s “manufactured” by JD.com.com that begins on June 1 and ends on June 18 (thus “618”), which happens to be the company’s founding anniversary. The comparable “manufactured” shopping holidays in the U.S. would be Amazon’s Prime Day and the set of shopping days around the Thanksgiving holiday (Black Friday and Cyber Monday).</p><p>Here’s a chart comparing the GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) in USD among these four e-commerce shopping events in the last three years:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TdojTyICC3sAQb2w7Ojrm04N_qNDNba_tSq9KOSGJrhFzwadr77S8mlc4iLiORauHfJJ7sqY_FrzKEn-NmOfHGerieko1fYEnZ4UjxxZA1ZcqXDcPMEJYRAd5vq4BUPhXZORT95E" alt=""></figure><p>A few things to keep in mind as you look at these numbers: the GMV volumes for 618 and Singles Day reflected in this chart are by the original creator of that holiday, i.e. JD.com for 618 and Alibaba for Singles’ Day. Thus, it’s not a full picture of the entire GMV volume that was generated on those days. I did this because these shopping holidays, which used to be driven just by the company that created it, are now national events where almost every company participates, thus tracking the total volume gets a bit messy. For example, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/19/alibaba-and-jdcom-score-record-sales-on-618-shoppi.aspx">during the most recent 2020 618</a>, the first shopping holiday since the coronavirus outbreak, JD.com pulled in $38 billion USD and Alibaba pulled in $98 billion USD for a total of $136 billion USD just between those two platforms. That total certainly does not include new e-commerce upstarts, like Pinduoduo and Little Red Book. As for “U.S. Thanksgiving”, it’s the combined online shopping volume of three days: Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, across all retailers big and small.</p><p>Whether you agree with my approach or not, I think the overarching point is clear: China’s e-commerce size is multiple times bigger than America’s. <strong>But what’s the implication from an engineering and technology sandboxing perspective?</strong></p><h2 id="build-build-build">Build, Build, Build</h2><p>While all that Wall Street analysts and venture capitalists may see are massive revenue and business growth, for engineers and operators, what they see are technical and logistical challenges. GMV is just a measurement of transaction volume and may not translate directly to profit. But regardless of profitability, a technology stack needs to withstand that workload, with each transaction leading to processing and updates in payment gateways, bank records, user profiles, warehouse inventories, delivery dispatches, and many other places in the system.</p><p>To illustrate these scaling challenges more concretely, during the 2019 Singles’ Day, the peak transaction volume on Alibaba’s various shopping platforms was <a href="https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2019-11-11/doc-iihnzahi0215062.shtml">544,000 transactions per second</a> and the total amount of data processed on Alibaba Cloud was <a href="https://www.infoq.cn/article/r8GENiPVdMQwdaScrb86">around 970 petabyte</a>. No matter how you slice and dice them, these are huge numbers on a huge scale.</p><p><strong>This predicament is a blessing and a curse. </strong>The curse is, of course, the many all-nighters that the engineers, product managers, designers, operators, i.e. all the builders, have to endure to create, build, and test different solutions to meet these challenges. On-calls, 2 am pager alerts, even interrupted weddings, are the human cost that goes into making these solutions work.</p><p>The blessing is that <strong>many newer, better-designed technologies are being battle-tested earlier in their development, pushing them to mature more quickly, which is good for technological advancement in general.</strong> You can write all the test suites and simulations you want, but nothing beats large-scale production workloads to give a piece of technology a real test and fair shake. <strong>And China has plenty of those workloads to go around. </strong></p><p>Thus, large Chinese tech companies are early adopters of many young technologies that their American counterparts might shun. <strong>This risk profile is born out of necessity, not luxury. </strong>They live in a cutthroat, competitive business environment. They have to not only meet current demands, but also architect their tech stack to adapt to new commercial models as they pop up and become popular. <strong>One recent example would be livestream shopping.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 1000w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 1600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w2048/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 2048w"><figcaption>What livestream shopping looks like in China.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="some-beneficiaries">Some Beneficiaries</h2><p>Here’s a list of new technologies that became<strong> publicly available in the last five years</strong> -- some home-grown in China, some created elsewhere -- that have benefited from the China-scale technology sandbox.</p><p><a href="https://kylin.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Kylin</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source online analytical engine first created by eBay’s engineering team in China. It has been battle-tested in companies like Baidu, JD.com, and Xiaomi. It is commercially supported and augmented by the startup, Kyligence.</p><p><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Pulsar</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source distributed data streaming system first created and deployed inside Yahoo. It has benefited greatly from wide usage inside Tencent, <a href="https://streamnative.io/blog/tech/2019-10-22-powering-tencent-billing-platform-with-apache-pulsar/">specifically its billing platform that</a> integrates with many payment gateways, not just WeChat Pay. The project is commercially supported by the startup, StreamNative.</p><p><a href="https://skywalking.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Skywalking</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source application performance monitor tool, designed to observe microservices. It has been used in Huawei, Xiaomi, Tencent, and Alibaba Cloud, among others. The startup <a href="https://www.tetrate.io/">Tetrate</a>, which provides enterprise-grade service mesh solutions based on the open-source projects, Envoy and Istio, also commercially supports Skywalking.</p><p><a href="https://goharbor.io/"><strong>Harbor</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source cloud-native registry service that secures artifacts, like containers, with policies and role-based access control. It was originally created by VMWare’s engineering team in China, then donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to be governed independently. It’s been battle-tested in companies, like JD.com and China Mobile. Harbor recently reached <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2020/06/23/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-harbor-graduation/">“graduation” status in the CNCF</a>, indicating its maturity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>: </strong>an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware. It was born out of academia at UC Berkeley in 2010, so you can argue that it shouldn’t belong on this list. That being said, its <a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/">user-space ISA</a> and <a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/">privileged ISA </a>wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for software and hardware development, until June 2019. Alibaba has put a lot of resources into RISC-V and <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date.</a> The entire ecosystem is stewarded by the foundation, RISC-V International, with four<a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/"> of the six Premier Members</a> being Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, RIOS Lab (out of Shenzhen), and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb">TiDB</a> / <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv">TiKV</a>:</strong> two open-source projects that, when combined together, offer a MySQL-compatible distributed relational database with analytical capabilities. Both projects were initially created and open-sourced by the startup, PingCAP. TiKV has since been donated to the CNCF similar to Harbor and is <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/414">currently under review to “graduate” </a>as well. These two technologies have been battle-tested in companies, like Meituan-Dianping (the Yelp + Uber Eats + Groupon + TripAdvisor of China). Its usage has expanded to tech companies in Japan, India, Southeast Asia, among other regions. Based on a ranking of database technologies <a href="https://www.modb.pro/dbRank">created in China by the data industry-focused website MoTianLun</a>, TiDB is the most popular solution.</p><p>This list of beneficiaries is by no means comprehensive. (I welcome your suggestion of other technologies I’ve missed; just email or <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinsxu">tweet at me</a>!) If we expand the time frame to longer than five years, <strong>a few more technologies easily come to mind: Apache Flink in Alibaba, Alluxio (from UC Berkeley) in Baidu and Tencent, CockroachDB in Baidu, Vitess (from YouTube) in JD.com, to name a few.</strong> We can arguably include the industry-default container orchestration software, Kubernetes, as well, because JD.com adopted Kubernetes very early in its development and <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/02/qa-with-jd-com-kubernetes-cloud-native-and-cncf-projects-driving-big-data-and-ai/">runs one of the largest bare metal production clusters</a> in the world.</p><p>All these technologies happen to be open source solutions, which may be due to my own personal bias for open source. That being said, open-source is also the most common, if not default, way that new technologies get created nowadays. China’s own open-source ecosystem is burgeoning, which I wrote about at length in my “Open Source in China” series: <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-players/">Part I</a>, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">II</a>, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-trends/">III</a>.</p><h2 id="let-technology-be-technology">Let Technology Be Technology?</h2><p>A piece of technology that has been battle-tested by the workloads of a Tencent, Meituan-Dianping, or JD.com should comfortably withstand the requirements of a Snap, Uber Eats, or Shopify. The Chinese Internet economy is a fertile ground for technology innovators, not just in China but everywhere, to accelerate the improvement and maturity of their creations. <strong>All technologies should be nationless and borderless, in theory. </strong></p><p>Of course, there are tradeoffs to every decision. Real concerns and difficulties exist in operating in China’s technology landscape.

<p>I have a dedicated server with LXD installed where I have a bunch of system containers running to host a lot of my playground services, and to access the operating system of those lxc containers, I need to SSH to the LXD host, then exec or ssh into that LXC container.</p>

<p>This became tedious and wanted a way to directly ssh to them, as they don’t have public ip addresses, it’s not possible but found its possible to access them using proxyjump.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Query failed (#20200401_113622_00676_p7qp7): Hash mismatch, read: 1251072184702746109, calculated: 7591448164918409110
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, first half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, secnd half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, first half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; changed
cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, secnd half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; original
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comparing binary files is fun, but in practice it can be more convenient to compare <code>hexdump</code> output.
The output below was created with <code>vimdiff &lt;(hexdump -Cv original) &lt;(hexdump -Cv changed)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/vercel">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A while ago I tweeted the good news that we’ve handed over our largest single monetary reward yet in the <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/bugbounty.html">curl bug-bounty program</a>: 700 USD. We announced this security problem in association with the <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/06/24/curl-7-71-0-blobs-and-retries/">curl 7.71.0 release</a> the other day.</p>



<p>Someone responded to me and wanted this clarified: we award 700 USD to someone for reporting a curl bug that potentially affects users on virtually every computer system out there – while Apple just days earlier <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-lands-100000-reward-for-sign-in-with-apple-authentication-bypass-bug/">awarded a researcher 100,000 USD</a> for an Apple-specific security flaw.</p>



<p>The difference in “amplitude” is notable.</p>



<h2>A bug-bounty</h2>



<p>I think first we should start with appreciating that we have a bug-bounty program at all! Most open source projects don’t, and we didn’t have any program like this for the first twenty or so years. Our program is just getting started and we’re getting up to speed.</p>



<h2>Donations only</h2>



<p>How can we in the curl project hand out any money at all? We get donations from companies and individuals. This is the only source of funds we have.<strong> We can only give away rewards if we have enough donations in our fund.</strong></p>



<p>When we started the bug-bounty, we also rather recently had started to get donations (to our <a href="https://opencollective.com/curl">Open Collective fund</a>) and we were careful to not promise higher amounts than we would be able to pay, as we couldn’t be sure how many problems people would report and exactly how it would take off.</p>



<h2>The more donations the larger the rewards</h2>



<p>Over time it has gradually become clear that we’re getting donations at a level and frequency that far surpasses what we’re handing out as bug-bounty rewards. As a direct result of that, we’ve agreed in the the curl security team to increase the amounts.</p>



<p>For all security reports we get now that end up in a confirmed security advisory, we will increase the handed out award amount – until we reach a level we feel we can be proud of and stand for. I think that level should be more than 1,000 USD even for the lowest graded issues – and maybe ten times that amount for an issue graded “high”. We will however never get even within a few magnitudes of what the giants can offer.</p>

A so called hockey stick graph.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Are we improving security-wise?</h2>



<p>The graph with number of reported CVEs per year shows that we started to get a serious number of reports in 2013 (5 reports) and it also seems to show that we’ve passed the peak. I’m not sure we have enough enough data and evidence to back this up, but I’m convinced we do a lot of things much better in the project now that should help to keep the amount of reports down going forward. In a few years when we look back we can see if I was right.</p>



<p>We’re at mid year 2020 now with only two reports so far, which if we keep this rate will make this the best CVE-year after 2012. This, while we offer more money than ever for reported issues and we have a larger amount of code than ever to find problems in.</p>

<h2>The companies surf along</h2>



<p>One company suggests that they will chip in and pay for an increased curl bug bounty <em>if the problem affects their use case,</em> but for some reason the problems just never seem to affect them and I’ve pretty much stopped bothering to even ask them.</p>



<p>curl is shipped with a large number of operating systems and in a large number of applications but yet not even the large volume users participate in the curl bug bounty program but leave it to us (and they rarely even donate). Perhaps you can report curl security issues to them and have a chance of a higher reward?</p>



<p>You would possibly imagine that these companies should be keen on helping us out to indirectly secure users of their operating systems and applications, but no. We’re an open source project.

    <p><em>Writing assembly code that runs on multiple architectures.</em></p>
    <p>A few years back, while I worked as a Solaris engineer at Oracle,
I posted an april fools joke to one of our internal mailing lists.
Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">Solaris</a>?
<a href="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/pepperidge-farm.jpg">Pepperidge farm remembers</a>.
Unfortunatelly Solaris 12 was
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/oracle-sort-of-confirms-demise-of-solaris-12-effort/">never released</a>
(not as such, anyway) and many of the devs were laid off shortly afterwards,
but that's a different story... The april fools e-mail read as follows:</p>
<pre><span>Hi all,
   can I please get a codereview for my new Hello World program?
The purpose of the program is to output a greeting.
As the code is very short, I'm inlining it at the end of this email.
The code has been tested on sparc and x86.
Only 64 bit arch is supported - please compile with cc -m64.
cstyle reports no issues.

Thanks!
Vojtech

<p>I expect <code>main()</code> not being a function and instead being an array of numbers
won't be news to many people, this
<a href="http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-a-function.html">has been done before</a>.
(If you've never seen this before, have a look at that blogpost, it's pretty good!)</p>
<p>The focus of this post instead is this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The code has been tested on sparc and x86.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any code that a Solaris dev looked to push to the core repository
had to be rigorously tested on both architectures targeted by Solaris: x86 and SPARC.
And this code doesn't really look like it could run on multiple architectures, right? ...
But it does. And it does that with a trick I call a <em>polyglot assembly</em> code.
Maybe that's a little too pompous a name for a silly joke, but I didn't know what else to call it...</p>
<h2 id="linux-x86-64-arm">Linux, x86-64 &amp; ARM</h2>
<p>I recently decided to revive the idea and, since both Solaris and SPARC
are fairly obscure nowadays, to port the code over to Linux on x86-64 and ARM.</p>
<p>Here's the new code:</p>
<pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdint.h&gt;

</span><span>const </span><span>uint64_t</span><span> _start[] </span><span>__attribute__</span><span>((section(</span><span>".text"</span><span>))) </span><span>= </span><span>{
    0xe3a00001909032eb, 0xe3a0200ce28f1014,
    0xef000000e3a07004, 0xe3a07001e3a00000,
    0x6c6c6548ef000000, 0x0a214d5241202c6f,
    0x18ec834800000000, 0x4800000045058b48,
    0xa20fc03148240489, 0x0c24548908245c89,
    0x142444c710244c89, 0x01c0c74800000a21,
    0x0001c7c748000000, 0x480124748d480000,
    0x050f00000015c2c7, 0x480000003cc0c748,
    0x6c654820050fff31, 0x00000000202c6f6c,
};
</span></pre>
<p>It's still just a <em>Hello, World!</em> program.</p>
<p>To build it, I recommend <code>gcc -static -nostdlib</code>.
I found out the special section attribute is necessary for gcc to put the code in the right section.</p>
<p>You can also get pre built binaries <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot/releases/tag/0.1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the resulting binaries are <strong>still platform-specific</strong>.
The polyglot trick's purpose is to make it possible to build for x86-64 and ARM from the same source file.
While the executable code inside the ELF file is the same bit by bit for both platforms,
the ELF header and section layout is somewhat different and unfortunatelly there seems to be no way around this
(at minimum, the kernel checks the ELF architecture byte and won't load the program unless it matches).</p>
<p>So anyway, how does it work?</p>
<p><img src="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/diagram.png#right" alt="diagram"></p>
<p>The basic idea is pretty simple: The code starts with a magical snippet
that gets interpreted by both architectures and basically performs
a conditional jump based on which architecture is runing the code.</p>
<p><em>Architecture #1</em> decodes this bit as a an effective no-op instruction
(in my example it's actually an ALU instruction whose output is ignored)
and simply continues to the area marked blue in the diagram.
<em>Arch-#1</em>-specific code is stored there.</p>
<p><em>Architecture #2</em> decodes the initial part as a jump and proceeds
to jump over to the yellow area where the code for <em>arch #2</em> follows.</p>
<p>How do you come up with the magical architecture-selecting prolog?</p>
<p>It turns out x86 is actually a pretty good choice for <em>arch #2</em>, because it has
a short near-jump instruction, just 2 bytes. Together with 2 <code>NOP</code>s (1 byte each)
this makes up the length of one regular (non-Thumb) ARM instruction.</p>
<p>The three x86 instructions, a <code>JMP</code> and two <code>NOP</code>s, can be arbitrarily reordered
and also the jump distance can be adjusted, and as I found out this is
enough degrees of freedom to find a valid nop-like ARM instruction.</p>
<h2 id="searching-the-instruction-space">Searching the instruction space</h2>
<p>The original Solaris code was a result of basically just hokus-pokus.
In the Linux rewrite I tried to come up with a somewhat more automated way of finding the right combo.
There's a hackish <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot/blob/master/jmps.py">python script</a>
and a Makefile rule that generate <a href="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/jmps.txt">a big plaintext list</a> of all <code>NOP</code>/<code>NOP</code>/2-byte <code>JMP</code>
permutations along with their ARM representations.</p>
<p>From the list it's apparent that the <code>JMP</code>, <code>NOP</code>, <code>NOP</code> ordering yields a safe
ARM <code>addsls</code> instruction most of the time, at least as long as the jump distance is small enough
for the <code>addsls</code> to not touch the <code>sp</code> or <code>pc</code> registers...</p>
<p>In my case I only need to <code>JMP</code> 52 bytes ahead. This results in <code>addsls r3, r0, r11, ror #5</code> on ARM,
which is a perfectly harmless instruction. Maybe a bit too complex (a conditional add with a bit rotation), but harmless.</p>
<p>In summary, the magical bytes that make an x86 CPU jump ahead and
an ARM CPU continue are:</p>
<pre><span>eb 32 90 90
</span></pre><h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
<p>The source code for this mini-project can be found <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot">on my github</a>.</p>
<p>The C file quoted above effectively contains the following two code paths for x86-64 and ARM, respectively:</p>

<p>I decided to automate the whole process of generating the C file and the binaries for x86-64 and ARM.
There's a big <code>Makefile</code> that goes through the arduous process of first generating ARM code from the source ARM asm file,
dumping the compiled ARM, feeding that to a Python script with a template of the x86 + compiled ARM code,
compiling that, generating the C source from that, and finally compiling the C source for both x86 and ARM.</p>
<p>Running the Makefile requires having an arm cross-compiling gcc installed along with a matching gdb.</p>
<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical applications</h2>
<p>There are none :-)</p>
<p>At least as far as I know.
As stated earlier, the resulting binary is still platform-specific,
Which means the trick can't be used to make multi-platform ELFs :-|</p>
<p>In theory it could be used to create a multi-platform shellcode,
but I find it unlikely that it would actually be useful in practice.</p>
<p>Multi-platform kernels maybe? But then again boot procedures differ quite a lot
between architectures, so again it's probably not very practical...</p>
<p>So yeah, it's really just a joke done for fun and to perhaps learn something new...</p>

        <p>Knowing how to use containers in application development is a must for a modern-day developer. One reason for the recent demand for containers has been the emergence of Docker. Docker has not only increased the use of containers, it has had a great impact on the way we approach application development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a developer who is yet to find a proper introduction to this popular technology, you are in the right place. In this article, we are going to introduce you to the concept of Docker and get a hands-on approach to learning Docker by dockerizing a simple application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let’s clarify what Docker is and why it has become this important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Docker is a tool developers use to create, deploy, and run applications in an isolated environment through containers.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is again, containers. Though this term is used a few times since the beginning of the article, you may not have an idea what a container is. In order to fully understand the above statement, we have to first understand what a container is.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-container-and-why-do-we-need-it">What is a Container and Why Do We Need It?</h2>
<p>A container is a software unit that packs application code and all the dependencies used in the application into a single package. Packaging allows the container to isolate the application from the host environment it is running in. The application sees the container as its environment instead of the host device. This abstraction guarantees that an application running in a development environment is able to run in a production environment without going through significant changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if several applications are running on the host device, the container isolates the containerized application from interfering with the operation of other applications and sharing their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before containers, virtual machines were used to isolate applications from the host environment. In virtual machines, each machine uses a separate operating system to run the application. Though this approach also achieves the purpose of isolating the applications, it has a downside of adding too much overhead on top of the application. Containers, on the other hand, share the OS kernel of the host device instead of using an OS of its own, which removes the overhead added by the virtual machines. This makes containers more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though containers have been in use long before Docker, it’s safe to say that Docker is the biggest reason for the extreme popularity of containers in the modern programming world. Other than being open-source, Docker’s ease of use, reliability, and efficiency made the programming world instantly fall in love with this technology.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-the-dockerfile-docker-image-and-docker-engine">What are the Dockerfile, Docker Image, and Docker Engine?</h2>
<p>Docker comes with its special language. Dockerfile, Docker image, and Docker engine are 3 words commonly used among Docker users. These are also the 3 most important components used when building Docker containers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h3>
<p>Dockerfile contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image, which we are going to discuss next. These instructions will be run one after the other when creating the Docker image. Instructions in the Dockerfile contain information such as the host device’s OS, the programming language of the application, application directory location, network ports, and environment variables.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h3>
<p>Docker image is a template that is used to create the final Docker container for the application. We can generate the Docker image of an application by running the docker build command with the Dockerfile as a parameter. To create the Docker container, we use the docker run command and the Docker image.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="docker-engine">Docker Engine</h3>
<p>Docker engine is where all the Docker containers are running on. Both Windows and Linux based applications can run on Docker engines.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-dockerize-a-simple-application">How to Dockerize a Simple Application</h2>
<p>Now we have got to the most interesting part of this tutorial. We are going to dockerize a simple application to get hands-on Docker experience. First, we will create a simple Node.js application and then, create the Dockerfile, Docker image, and finally the Docker container for the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before continuing, however, make sure you have Docker installed on your device. You can follow the official documentation to install Docker on your <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubuntu OS</a>. Check out the docs for other OS.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-simple-nodejs-application">Create a Simple Node.js Application</h3>
<p>We are going to create a simple Node application that sends a “Hello World” message when we visit the root route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to set up your application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">npm init
npm install express --save
</code></pre></div><p>Inside the directory, <code>app.js</code> file contains our main application code.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>express</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>require</span>(<span>'express'</span>)
<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>app</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>express</span>()
&nbsp;
<span>app</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>'/'</span>,&nbsp;(<span>req</span>,&nbsp;<span>res</span>)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>res</span>.<span>send</span>(<span>"Hello&nbsp;World!"</span>)
})
&nbsp;
<span>app</span>.<span>listen</span>(<span>process</span>.<span>env</span>.<span>PORT</span>,&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"Node&nbsp;server&nbsp;has&nbsp;started&nbsp;running"</span>)
})
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-the-dockerfile-for-the-application">Create the Dockerfile for the Application</h3>
<p>Now we can create the Dockerfile with the information that is needed to create the Docker image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>Dockerfile</code> inside the application directory. To create the Docker Image for our application, the Dockerfile should contain a set of commands like this.&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>FROM</span><span> node:latest</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /docker-tutorial</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> . .<span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>ENV</span> PORT <span>3000</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> npm install<span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>EXPOSE</span><span> $PORT</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>ENTRYPOINT</span> [<span>"node"</span>, <span>"app.js"</span>]<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we will go through what each of these commands means.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>FROM—This command sets the base image and the new image of the application is built on top of this. In our case, we use an image that contains npm and the latest Node.js version. This image is pulled from Docker Hub which is a public repository of Docker images.&nbsp;</li>
<li>WORKDIR—This command sets the working directory for the application that will be running inside the container.&nbsp;</li>
<li>COPY—This command copies the files in the application directory to the working directory which we set with the previous command. You can pass the path to a specific file name or do as above to copy all the files in the application directory to the Docker image. In the latter case, make sure you have navigated to the application directory on the command line when running the docker build command.</li>
<li>ENV—In the Node application, note how we passed the environment variable, PORT (process.env.PORT), to the app.listen function instead of directly passing the port number the application should listen to. Therefore, we have to set the PORT environment variable in the application environment. For our application that is going to the Docker container. So, we use the ENV command to pass the variables that we want to set as environment variables inside the Docker container.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RUN—This command runs npm install to install the dependencies used in our application, which are saved to package.json file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>EXPOSE—This command exposes the application to listen to the given port. Since we have already set the port number as an environment variable, we pass the variable name, $PORT, &nbsp;in place of the actual port number. However, remember that the application is exposed to the port 3000 inside the container’s environment and not the host device’s environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>ENTRYPOINT—This command sets how to enter, or how to start, our application. Docker joins the array we pass to create a single command that starts the application, which is node app.js.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="build-the-docker-image">Build the Docker Image</h3>
<p>We use docker build command to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile. Here is how it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">docker build -t &lt;image-name&gt; &lt;dockerfile-location&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure you have navigated to the application directory on your command-line before running the command. You can pass a dot (.) in place of the Dockerfile location to indicate that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our example we will run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">docker build -t docker-tutorial .
</code></pre></div><p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.008MB

</code></pre></div><p>Once you run the docker build command, Docker will execute each command in the Dockerfile consecutively. When executing the FROM command, if the Node image hasn’t been pulled to your device before, Docker will pull the image from Docker Hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once all the commands are executed, you will see the message “successfully built” if the image was created without running into an error.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

After being acquired by Facebook in 2014, its numbers increased, and now, over two billion users make use of WhatsApp every month.</p><p>Hackers have introduced a new verification scam which put the billions of WhatsApp users at risk. It is a clever hack which is why experts fear that a lot of users will fall for it.</p><p>Usually, the hackers pose as friends and try to convince you to send them your login code. Other times they pose as the WhatsApp Technical Team using the WhatsApp logo so they look legit enough. These hackers send messages to their targets, telling them that they need to verify their WhatsApp account.</p><p>The WhatsApp verification scam not only put users at risk of losing their personal details, but they can also lose their entire if they give out their login code. With the login code, the hackers will be able to send and read messages with the victims’ accounts.</p><p>Considering how frequent WhatsApp requires updating, most users will be unsuspicious of these messages. Users have been advised against falling victims to such scam as the WhatsApp Technical Team do not message users on the WhatsApp platform.</p><p>This was made known via a Whatsapp blog, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/">WABetaInfo</a>. They dismissed the messages as fake and if WhatsApp were to message users, there will be a green verified indicator for authenticity.

from this messy, massive data and maximize my data value?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>With the development of cloud computing, more and more enterprises are considering building their own IT business systems and enterprise application platforms on the cloud to realize an agile, efficient and cost-controllable new IT architecture through rapidly evolving big data technology and its scalable distributed architecture.</p>







<p><strong>Challenges</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>How can the timeliness of analysis be guaranteed when the scale of data constantly increases?</li><li> How can we achieve cost optimization?</li><li>How can we achieve unified data management and enable cross-departmental collaboration?</li><li>How does the technical architecture meet future challenges?</li></ul>







<h2><strong>These Are the 4 Key Elements to Evaluate When Selecting a Cloud Big Data Analysis Service</strong></h2>







<p><strong><em>1: Engine Analysis</em></strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Performance Guarantee:</strong> In the era of big data, the explosive growth in the scale of enterprise data has not only brought about the expansion of data magnitudes from TB to PB, it has also increased data complexity. In the pursuit of lean data analysis, enterprises must evaluate whether an analysis engine can provide high concurrency and excellent analysis capability when working with massive data volumes. </p>



<p>Enterprises need to consider an engineâ€™s performance according to both their existing and future needs. While evaluating the concurrency and performance of third-party software, enterprises should also investigate the degree of integration with cloud services, such as computing and storage.</p>







<p><strong>Cost Control:</strong> According to the results of the <em>RightScale 2019 State of the Cloud Report from Flexera</em>, about 35% of costs for enterprise cloud services are wasted. The reasons for such huge waste often includes over-allocation, idle resources, and all-day operation of virtual machines. </p>



<p>At present, there are many cloud cost management software options on the market, such as Nutanix Beam, Turbonomic, ParkMyCloud, and more. Most cloud vendors also have corresponding native services, such as Azure Cost Management and Amazon CloudWatch.</p>



<p>Computing resources often account for a heavy part of the cost for big data analysis services on the cloud. The most common cost control mechanism is to manually monitor and adjust those resources through third-party cloud cost management software, while another option is for the big data analysis service to actively conduct intelligent adjustments internally.</p>







<p><strong><em>2: Data Management</em></strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Unified Business Logic:</strong> With the growth of data practitioners and data applications, each business line is building its own data system to drive business growth. Based on user preferences, different business units supported by IT use different BI tools and data marts for their business analysis. </p>



<p>Due to each data platformâ€™s construction and different departmental requirements, each BI tool needs to develop semantic information separately, which can easily create isolated islands of data analysis.</p>



<p>If there is no consensus on data definitions and measurement standards, that lack of unified analysis means an analyst cannot see the whole picture of the business. </p>



<p>Their data analysis results will be undermined and their efforts will eventually be wasted. It is especially important for data management that the enterprise understands how to avoid data silos and enable data consumers from different business departments to form a unified understanding and cognition of data resources.</p>



<p>In order to build a unified big data analysis platform, consider whether the new products/services can be seamlessly integrated with your existing BI tools, provide friendly and standard interfaces, and match the usage habits and analysis efficiency of different business departments, as well as whether it can help build a unified semantic layer to share business logic.</p>







<p><strong>Security Policy:</strong> As more and more enterprises plan to store data on big data platforms to form a unified data lake, personal identity information (PII), detailed financial data and other types of proprietary and protected data will be centralized on the big data platform, and so the CIO is bound to pay more and more attention to security policies, data access control and audit requirements. </p>



<p>In order to help different users realize different data views on a unified data service, data analysis technology on the cloud needs to be able to provide fine-grained access control to ensure data privacy to the greatest extent while still providing a unified and efficient data platform. </p>



<p>If the security policy can be unified, that is, users and data access management can be uniformly configured in the data asset layer of the big data platform and act on all upper-level business applications, IT will not need to configure additional data access control for lower-level systems.</p>







<p><strong><em>3: Technical Architecture</em></strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Cloud Native Architecture: </strong>Enterprises need to be forward-looking when designing technology architecture, that is, the technology architecture should not only be able to face the immediate challenges but also be flexible enough to face future unknown challenges. </p>



<p>Gartner’s analysis report <em>How to use Semantics to Drive the Business Value of Your Data</em> points out that the deployment and innovation of database management systems are increasingly giving priority to cloud deployment or only offering cloud deployment.</p>



<p>The concept of “cloud native” has been used since it was put forward in 2013. Cloud native refers to the adoption of technologies and management methods specially optimized for agile delivery models on the cloud to achieve efficient and continuous service capabilities. </p>



<p>More and more enterprises prefer a cloud native architecture that can make full use of the open cloud computing technology ecosystem, reduce delivery risks and better cope with future unknown challenges.</p>







<p><strong><em>4: Technical Ecosystem</em></strong></p>



<p>At present, there are many mature solutions in the enterprise data analysis ecosystem, including cloud platform, data source, data processing, data analysis, etc. An open big data architecture enables enterprises to make full use of their advantages to form an end-to-end technical architecture. </p>



<p>The openness of a data analysis service can be evaluated through API support with mainstream software and integration with mainstream data processing frameworks.</p>

			<p><span>Y</span>ou might imagine that in the midst of a global pandemic and all of its social and economic fallout that our minds would be laser-focused on immediate, Earthly woes. But apparently not entirely. A case in point is the recent virus-like spread of news headlines to the effect that there should be “at least 36 alien civilizations” in our galaxy. Not 10, not a thousand, or a billion, but 36. There you have it, three dozen other sets of intelligent life dotting our cosmic neighborhood, so stick that in your pipe and smoke it.</p><p>It’s at times like these that you can almost hear the collective sigh from astronomers and astrobiologists who realize that they have to roll up their sleeves to gently, politely, carefully try to explain why these headlines are, shall we say, of the same nature as the matter that emanates from ruminant digestive systems.</p><blockquote><p>Charting the development of civilizations as a simple function of the age of life on a planet seems positively ludicrous.</p> </blockquote><p>But I’m getting ahead of the arc here. Right now, in science, the question of whether we are alone in the universe or not is crying out for some kind of answer. Perhaps more so than at any time in recorded human history. There is a confluence of reasons for this sense of urgency and importance. For one thing we now know that planets are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab88b0" target="_blank">fantastically abundant</a> in the universe and are potentially the best incubators of the complex chemistry associated with life as we understand it. We’re also getting closer to being able to evaluate some of these other worlds, these exoplanets, with a fidelity of data that could reveal rudimentary signatures of life, through its chemistry and the changes it wreaks on a planetary environment. Simultaneously there is a resurgence of interest in the quest to look for evidence not just of life but of technological life; either emitting structured information in radio waves or laser pulses, or sculpting its surroundings in ways that reflect intent and sophistication.<br></p><p>Consequently, many scientists are actively looking for ways to incorporate even the tiniest hints or clues that come from new data or insights to see if we can’t come up with statistically meaningful statements about the likelihood of life elsewhere—be it microbes or civilizations. In that sense (and I count myself in this category), we are the kids shaking the nicely wrapped presents to see if we can tell what we’re getting. The problem is that the wrapping may not come off for a long time, and that all of our guesses rest on fundamental assumptions—on prior knowledge or expectations that are themselves possibly highly biased and unusual.</p><div>

</p>


</article>
</div><p>It is those assumptions that gets us back to the headline-grabbing statements about 36 alien civilizations. These headlines are based on a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03968" target="_blank">study</a> by two respectable scientists, Tom Westby and Christopher Conselice at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. What these researchers actually say is that, based on a very specific calculation (that I’ll come to shortly) there is an argument to be made for the possible existence of anywhere between about half a dozen to over 200 civilizations capable of communication in our galaxy.</p><p>Arriving at those figures involves a number of steps. Some are to do with a detailed astrophysical analysis to evaluate the likely number of stars and planetary systems of particular ages and elemental compositions. It turns out, for example, that stars in our galaxy are, on average, about 9.8 billion years old—not surprisingly matching the age of the era during which most stars were formed.</p><p>But other steps involve assumptions that are extremely tricky to justify, and highly contentious. This is not to unduly criticize the study, because it is entirely open and honest about these assumptions and is a stimulating contribution to these questions. Nonetheless, the assumptions are the weak link, as are similar ones in almost every paper ever written on this topic.</p><p>In this case two “principles” are suggested: a Weak Astrobiological Copernican Principle and a Strong Astrobiological Copernican Principle. The weak one is a scenario where, because of what we witness on Earth, it is assumed that planets only form intelligent life after they reach an age of 5 billion years. The strong one says that intelligent life has to form between 4.5 and 5.5 billion years into a planet’s existence, as it seems to have on Earth. The justification for choosing these figures is that if Earth is not special (as the modern form of the Copernican Principle would have it) then we would expect other life-bearing worlds to follow suit on average. The estimated number of alien civilizations derives from these constraints, after combination with the computed statistics of exoplanets and their properties.</p><p>This is also precisely where scientific feathers get righteously ruffled. The most direct technical rebuttal to these proposed assumptions and principles is that we on Earth suffer from powerful “winner bias.” If, for example, intelligence came along much earlier or much later it would look at its history and also select its time of existence as “the most likely.”</p><blockquote><p>The impetus of life toward intelligence over evolutionary time is, at best, a hypothesis.</p> </blockquote><p>That’s a thorny problem. But we already knew it was a problem, and there has been <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/2/395" target="_blank">sophisticated work</a> done to deploy the tools of so-called Bayesian probability to try <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11995" target="_blank">to account</a> for precisely this kind of bias. The results of all of those works tell us that we are truly, quantifiably ignorant about life’s most probable trajectory, and that our Earth-based data points have very limited discriminatory power.<br></p><p>The other rebuttal, that is in many ways far more interesting, is to do with our impressive ignorance about the very nature of life itself, and the nature of the phenomenon we blithely call “intelligence.” Because of that ignorance, charting the development of civilizations as a simple function of the age of life on a planet seems positively ludicrous.</p><p>What we do have is an emerging sense that life and its planetary environment are inextricably entwined. Every piece of Earth’s deep environmental history is a complicated story of the interactions and interdependencies of life and planet; of geochemistry and biogeochemistry. As a result, the trajectory of life here may only be partially reproducible anywhere else in the cosmos—even assuming the same chemical toolkit, the same information-bearing molecular structures and biochemistry, and the same rules of selection and evolution.</p><p>The nature of intelligence, or technological capacity, also tends to be conflated with the idea that life, on average, seems to become more complex over time. It has been posited that the improvements of prediction that complexity enables (the projection abilities of neural nets and brains) is one item at the root of this tendency. If an organism can guess the future better it ought to survive better. But, of course, there are living forms, from bacteria to plant life, that have remained largely unchanged for hundreds of millions, even billions, of years. If something works in biology there seems to be little need for it to change. The impetus of life toward intelligence over evolutionary time is, at best, a hypothesis.</p><p>In short, any assumptions about properties like intelligence or agency that we make based on what we currently know about life on Earth are on exceedingly shaky ground. To import those assumptions to quantitative analyses of the likelihood of civilizations elsewhere seems like a stretch in most cases. Although there is value to the intellectual exercise as preparation for when the time comes that we, perhaps, have more data to go by.</p><p>And perhaps too there is value to anything that, in the days and nights of the coming months, causes us to momentarily pause and think about the bigger picture. To find a little respite by contemplating the endlessly tumbling stories of societies and civilizations as they unfold across cosmic time.</p> <p><i>Caleb Scharf is an astrophysicist, the Director of Astrobiology at Columbia University in New York, and a founder of yhousenyc.org, an institute that studies human and machine consciousness.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p>Previous: Part 9 - <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/machine-learning-foundations-part-9-using-the-sequencing-apis" rel="nofollow noopener">Using the Sequencing APIs</a></p>
<p>Over the last few parts, we haven't done much machine learning. Instead, we looked at how you can preprocess text data to get it ready for training machine learning models. In this part, you're going to put that knowledge to use in training a text classifier, a model, which, when given a piece of text, will understand the contents of that text.</p>
<p>You'll be working with the Sarcasm in News Headlines data set by Rishabh Misra, which is available on his website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. This is a really fun data set, which collects news headlines from normal news sources, as well as some more comedic ones from spoof news sites.</p>
<p>The data set is a JSON file with three columns. The <code>is_sarcastic</code> one is 1 if the record is sarcastic. Otherwise, it's 0. The <code>headline</code> is the headline of the article, and the <code>article_link</code> is a URL to the text of the article. We're just going to deal with the headlines here. So we have a super easy data set to work with. The headline is our feature, and the <code>is_sarcastic</code> is our label.</p>
<p>The data in JSON looks a bit like this.</p>
<pre>{
    "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/versace-black-code_us_5861fbefe4b0de3a08f600d5",
    "headline": "former versace store clerk sues over secret 'black code' for minority shoppers",
    "is_sarcastic": 0
}</pre>
<p>Each entry is a JSON field with the name-value pairs showing the column and associated data.</p>
<p>Here's the code to load it in Python when it's structured like that.</p>
<pre>import json

with open("sarcasm.json", 'r') as f:
    datastore = json.load(f)<br>
sentences = [] 
labels = []
urls = []
for item in datastore:
    sentences.append(item['headline'])
    labels.append(item['is_sarcastic'])
    urls.append(item['article_link'])</pre>
<p>I'll go through this piece by piece. First, we'll <code>import json</code> so that we can use the json parsers in Python. Then we'll open the <code>sarcasm.json</code> file.&nbsp; Using <code>json.load()</code>, we can load and parse the entire thing. I'll initialize arrays for the sentences, labels, and URLs. And I can now simply iterate through the datastore. And, for each item, I can append its headline, the sarcasm label, and URL to the appropriate array.</p>
<p>And that's it for loading the data. In previous parts, you may recall that we had hard-coded sentences into an array of strings. We now have exactly the same data structure for the headline sentences, despite that there are now over 25,000 of them. So, for the next code, despite us using this real data set, it will look very familiar. So let's dive in.</p>
<p>So here's the code to tokenize and sequence the sarcasm data set.</p>
<pre>from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token="")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index<br>
print(len(word_index))
print(word_index)<br>
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')<br>
print(padded[0])
print(padded.shape)</pre>
<p>We create a tokenizer and fit it on the sentences. In this case, the sentences are the large array of 25,000-plus sentences that we read from the sarcasm data set. We can use the tokenizer to show us the <code>word_index</code> so we can see what words it learned from the data set.&nbsp;And here's an example of some of the words.</p>
<pre>... 'blowing': 4064, 'packed': 4065, 'deficit': 4066, 'essential': 4067, 'explaining': 4068, 'pollution': 4069, 'braces': 4070, 'protester': 4071, 'uncle': 4072 ...</pre>
<p>Remember from earlier that the words with the lower number tokens are the ones that are more common, and the ones with the higher numbers, was less commonly used in the data set. So, of all of the words here, hurting is the one that was found most often.</p>
<p>We can now turn all of our sentences into sequences where, instead of words, we have the tokens representing those words. We'll pad them post, which means that all of the sentences will be the length of whatever the longest one is. And anything shorter than that will be padded with zeros at the end of the sentences in order to keep them all the same length. If we want to inspect them, we can then print out one of them, and we can print out the shape of the entire padded data structure. You'll see output like this.</p>
<pre>[  308 15115   679  3337  2298    48   382  2576 15116     6  2577  8434
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0]<p>(26709, 40)</p></pre>
<p>This is the first sentence in our corpus after tokenizing and padding. It's a shorter sentence. So it ends with a bunch of zeros. And this is the shape of the data structure for the padding. This tells us that we have 26,709 padded sentences, and each of these is 40 values long.</p>
<p>With just a few lines of code, you've loaded the data from sarcasm into sentence arrays, tokenized, and padded them.</p>
<p>First, in the code, you'll see a number of commonly used variables. Each of these will be used throughout the code. You've seen many of them so far, but others, like the embedding dimension, will be clear later. The <code>training_size</code> of 20,000 will be used next.</p>
<pre>vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 16
max_length = 100
trunc_type='post'
padding_type='post'
oov_tok = ""
training_size = 20000</pre>
<p>We have a corpus of many thousands of sentences and labels. And, moments ago, we specified 20,000 as the <code>training_size</code>. So that many sentences and labels will be the training set. And we'll hold back the other 6,000 or so as a validation set.</p>
<p>So our <code>training_sentences</code> will be the complete corpus from 0 to the <code>training_size</code>. And our <code>testing_sentences</code> will be from the <code>training_size</code> to the end of the set. We can do similar with the labels. The training will be the first batch, and the testing will be the last ones.</p>
<pre>training_sentences = sentences[0:training_size]
testing_sentences = sentences[training_size:]
training_labels = labels[0:training_size]
testing_labels = labels[training_size:]</pre>
<p>As we've split the data into training and testing sets, we should do the same for the padded sets, instead of having that one large master one that we had earlier on.</p>
<pre>tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size, oov_token=oov_tok)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(training_sentences)

word_index = tokenizer.word_index

training_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(training_sentences)
training_padded = pad_sequences(training_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)

testing_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(testing_sentences)
testing_padded = pad_sequences(testing_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)</pre>
<p>First, we'll create a tokenizer, and we'll specify the number of words that we want and what the out-of-vocabulary token should be. We'll fit the tokenizer to just the training_sentence corpus. This will help us accurately reflect any real-world usage. Our testing_sentences can be tested against the vocab that was learned from the training set. Now we can create a set of <code>training_sequences</code> from just the <code>training_sentences</code>. And we can pad these to get a set of padded training sentences. And then we can just do the same thing for the <code>testing_sentences</code> and for all the labels.</p>
<p>So before we can train a model with this, let's take a look at the concept of embeddings, which help us turn the sentiment of a word into a number in much the same way as we tokenized words earlier. In this case, an embedding is a vector pointing in a direction, and we can use those directions to establish meanings in words. I know this is all very vague. So let me explain it visually.</p>
<p>For example, consider the words <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>good</strong>. Now we know they have opposite meanings. So we could draw them as arrows pointing in opposite directions.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="826" height="91"> We could then describe the word <strong>meh</strong> as being sort of bad, but not really that bad. So it might be an arrow like this. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="797" height="349">And then the phrase not bad, it's not as strong as good, but it's more or less in the same direction as good. So we could draw it with an arrow like this.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="800" height="343"> If we then plot these on a chart, we could then get coordinates for these arrows. These coordinates could then be seen as embeddings for the sentiment of those words. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="969" height="491">There's no absolute meaning, but, relative to each other, we can establish sentiment.</p>
<p>To do this in code, we can simply use a Keras layer called an Embedding.</p>
<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])</pre>
<p>Our Embedding should be defined as a vector for every word. So we're going to take vocab-sized words and then specify how many dimensions we want the arrow direction to use.&nbsp; In this case, it's 16 that we created earlier. So the Embedding layer will learn 10,016 dimension vectors where the direction of the vector establishes the sentiment of the word. By matching the words to the labels, it'll have a direction that it can then start learning from.</p>
<p>Once we've defined the model, we can then train it like this.</p>
<pre>num_epochs = 30
history = model.fit(training_padded, training_labels, epochs=num_epochs, validation_data=(testing_padded, testing_labels), verbose=2)</pre>
<p>We simply specify the training_padded features and labels, as well as the validation ones.</p>
<p>Now you can try it for yourself. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2F3d6sIJY&amp;redir_token=ONe-_plC_prURgXQYxiQIX-HJVJ8MTU5MzE4OTQ0OEAxNTkzMTAzMDQ4&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=-8XmD2zsFBI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">URL</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully that was an interesting exploration for you into the beginnings of NLP with TensorFlow. And that brings us to the end of this 10-part series on foundations of machine learning. I hope you've enjoyed these series, and I hope you've been able to learn from them.</p>

<p>We had the Tamagotchi, a virtual pet that no one could ever keep alive:</p>

<p>The Furby, which still gives people nightmares today:</p>

<p>And of course, the Oregon Trail, a game that will forever define a generation:</p>

<p>But there was one fad I remember that not only took our school by storm, but schools all across the country as well. It grew so feverish that after a few months, schools had to actually ban this activity because too many students were getting obsessed with it.</p>
<p>If you were an ‘80s or ‘90s kid, chances are you’ll remember it too.</p>
<p>I’m referring to the infamous world of pogs:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>For those that didn’t get to experience this craze, I’ll briefly break it down for you.</p>
<p>Pogs were these thin, circular discs that were largely made from one of three materials: paper, aluminum, or plastic.<span title="Some kids had crazy titanium ones, but for those of us that weren’t born into extreme wealth, it wasn’t an option.">1</span> Each pog had a “face” side that had some sort of cool, colorful design on it, and a “back” side that was left blank.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The game itself was super simple, which made it ideal for 2nd graders across the world.</p>
<p>Each round, the players would contribute a few paper pogs, put them face down, and stack them up into one long cylinder. This is the “ante,” or the prize that the players are looking to win.</p>
<p>Then using a special, denser pog that was either made from aluminum or plastic (known as a “slammer” and “pounder,” respectively), each player would try to slam it on the stack, and flip over as many paper pogs as possible. Whichever pogs are successfully turned over would be the prizes they win.</p>

<p>That’s the whole game in a nutshell. Essentially, it’s slapping dense discs onto a stack of lesser dense discs, hoping to turn over as much of them as possible before the recess bell rings. Seems pretty harmless, right?</p>
<p>Well… there was one component to the game that made it a bit problematic for child psychology.</p>
<p>Before any game starts, you have to declare whether you’re playing “for fun” or “for keeps.” “For fun” means that you’re not actually keeping the pogs you turn over, and are returning them back to their original owners at the end of each match. “For keeps,” of course, means that you now own the pogs you turn over successfully, meaning that someone must lose something if another person wins.</p>
<p>Basically, a nice little gambling ring was growing amongst us starry-eyed 2nd graders.</p>

<p>Pogs originally started off as a little recess activity, but began morphing into something far greater.</p>
<p>Kids began comparing each other to how many pogs they had, and started forming groups based on the types of pogs that were owned and won. The kids with gold-plated, shiny pounders kept winning, so they needed to up the stakes and play for higher prizes. The kids that only had paper discs would be off in the sandbox being peasants.</p>
<p>Pogs became the shared currency of the school. Kids were trading their fruit rollups for slammers, their Lunchables for pounders. Kids were literally getting into fist fights over them. And of course, if you didn’t play pogs at all, you might as well be an invisible node of society. All that mattered was how many of them you had, and if you had the right equipment to win even more.</p>

<p>Eventually, the school staff saw enough crazed, disc-slamming kids in the hallways and put an end to the whole thing. They justified the ban by saying it was a form of gambling, but they probably just wanted to see things come back to normal for a bit.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, was that those adults were playing a very similar game in their own lives as well.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how money is accepted as an inevitable force in our lives, yet when we take out the concept and wrap it in unfamiliar packaging, it seems weird and dumb.</p>
<p>To the school staff, the whole pogs phenomenon probably seemed silly because they couldn’t understand what could be so compelling about flipping over paper and metal discs. But they wouldn’t think twice at the thought of coming into an office everyday, flipping over documents, and depositing a bi-weekly paper check in a metal machine.</p>
<p>In essence, the kids were doing the same thing the adults were doing: they were accumulating value in the form of a communal good. But because it took the form of something unrecognizable, it was considered dumb rather than profound. In the eyes of the adults, pogs were shittily constructed paper discs that had no intrinsic value, and only held importance because the kids themselves thought they were.</p>
<p>Well, those kids could say the same thing about the way we regard our own currency as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The most fascinating thing about the pogs phenomenon is how closely it mirrors the story of money, and how that concept naturally manifested in children.</p>
<p>On one side you have paper, aluminum, and plastic discs that have no inherent value – they can’t be eaten, worn, or slept on. On their own, they’re useless.</p>
<p>On the other side you have paper bills, metal coins, and digits on a screen that can’t be used as ends in themselves either. They’re just as useless.</p>
<p>Yet in both scenarios, a united story emerged that turned an intrinsically useless thing into the distributor of status, value, and prestige.</p>
<p>How in the world does this happen?</p>
<p>How does something with no intrinsic value become the universal determinant of value? And what are the implications this has on human behavior as a whole?</p>
<p>Discussions of money usually come with the implicit understanding that money is valuable, so they revolve around how one could accumulate more of it, or why it introduces <a href="https://moretothat.com/money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all kinds of strange behaviors</a>. But in this post, we’re going to take one step back and actually look at the concept of money itself: why we need it to represent value, how it impacts our goals, and how it reconstructs our idea of individuality.</p>
<p>This is a dive into the philosophy of money. It’s a look into humanity’s greatest idea, its greatest paradox, and the story that forever changed human behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h3>Money and The Great Abstraction</h3>
<p>Everything starts with the fact that money has no intrinsic value.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain why this is, but in order to do so, I need to first introduce my favorite game show ever:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The Price Is Right is a brilliant TV show where hyped-up contestants play a series of pricing estimation games. Essentially, whoever can guess the price of random shit better than the next person will find their way to a final showcase, where they can win a combination of a potted plant, a trip to Detroit, and a brand… new…. CAR!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>One of my favorite mini-games on the show was the Bonus Game, where the contestant must guess whether or not the real price of an item is higher or lower than what is displayed to the public.</p>
<p>And the best part?</p>
<p>The audience also gets to chime in and scream their opinions at the contestant, who then has to sort through a blend of aggressive commands to get to her final answer.</p>
<p>Here’s an amazing clip of the game in action:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/429124077" width="650" height="406" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>First off, Bob Barker had jokes for days.</p>
<p>But second, and more important:</p>
<p>This game is a perfect example of the discrepancy between subjective value and objective reality.</p>
<p>When people in the audience are <em>screaming</em> their opinions of what the price of an alarm clock is, what they are doing is making a <span><strong>value assessment</strong></span> about the object in question. Each person’s idea of that clock’s value is anchored to a personal experience one has with that item, and that could be based on a host of factors.</p>
<p><em>Am I using that alarm clock now? If not, how much is the one I’m currently using? Does that featured clock look like it’d be of better quality? Wait… why do I even care about this damn clock in the first place?</em></p>
<p>From the contestant’s point of view, the audience members sound like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>But to each audience member, every shout is guided by a judgment that is formed by personal experience, desire, and need:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Throughout all this, however, the clock simply exists. It is a collection of atoms and molecules that have been assembled to take this form, and there’s no value that is inherent in its chemical makeup. The only function it has is the one we assign it. We would primarily use it to wake up in the morning, but if there was a scary cockroach nearby that we wanted to get rid of, we could use the clock as an anvil too.</p>
<p>This creates a scenario where reality simply is, but the value we assign it will vary based upon the individual that interacts with it. And as illustrated in The Price Is Right, that value is spread across <span><strong>a spectrum of infinite wants and experiences</strong></span>, where one person would be willing to give up more than her neighbor, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For any one item of reality, there will be all kinds of value assessments attached to it, none of which are expected to be the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>So we need to form an intermediary between reality and value that could bridge the gap between the two. A way to standardize infinite value assessments into something understandable and transferable.</p>
<p>That third-party, of course, is money.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Money’s greatest achievement is its ability to standardize value across otherwise incomparable realities. For example, there’s no way I could tell you how many clocks I’d give for your car, or how many clocks I’d give for your house. But communicate those objects of desire through the language of money, and I’ll be able to calculate some relationship between the two.</p>
<p>This ability to create value relationships between every object or service is what allowed money to build a web through every corner of life. Before money, goods stood on their own because they were simply bartered for another object of desire. But after money, the value of goods were always calculated based on a third-party: some currency that was agreed upon by all the members of that society.</p>
<p>The question here then becomes: <em>how was that currency determined?</em></p>
<p>In money’s early history, it needed to have some sort of value inherent in it for people to trust it as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Its first iteration appeared in Sumer around 3,000 BC, where it manifested in the …</p></div></div>

				<p>Laura Deming is a biologist and founder of The Longevity Fund, the first VC firm to focus on companies that work on extending healthy human lifespan and addressing age-related diseases through biotechnology. She grew her roots in biology as a homeschooling student in New Zealand, and moved to the US to work in a <a href="https://hillblomcenter.ucsf.edu/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Hillblom,diseases%20have%20similar%20molecular%20causes.">UCSF biology lab</a> at age 12. By age 14, she was a student at MIT, then became a <a href="https://thielfellowship.org/">Thiel Fellow</a>. We asked Laura to share how her education prepared her to lead and build today.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/Frame-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Frame-2.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1754/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1754w"><figcaption>Laura Deming.

I normally have a few key focuses at work (right now, immune aging from a bunch of different angles), and then a billion other small ideas that float in and out of my cranium. My most persistent focus is something that I can’t talk about yet because it would sound slightly insane, but right now, I’m pursuing these more coherent questions: &nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Is there a flywheel effect with biological tools? Will biological discoveries become the tools for next-generation discovery? How might we predict progress in biology?</li><li>Why does it normally take about a year for the best proto-entrepreneurs I know to reach full conviction about starting a company? What are ways to accelerate that process?</li><li>Is there an immortal cell that doesn’t replicate anywhere on earth? (We presumably wouldn’t see it if there was.)</li></ol><p>I’m really obsessed with <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/">Cell Biology by the Numbers</a>. I think quantitative intuitive models of biology are the best thing ever. Also <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-morality-fundamental-physics">this Nima Arkani-Hamed</a> video is literally the best thing ever.</p><h3 id="what-was-your-education-like">What was your education like?</h3><p>I grew up homeschooled in NZ with a hilariously small amount of context for what the real world was like. In retrospect, it was totally ideal. I had two strong memes deeply implanted in my cranium early in life - <em>I love science </em>and <em>it’s my job to do something really important </em>and<em> I can do it, too. </em>I have no clue who I’d be without those memes, and I’m also not sure that the latter was actually true! My dad just always told me that I was exceptional and could work out a way whatever I wanted to do in the world and I believed him. I still do, in a funny way, despite about a decade of evidence to the contrary and realizing how actually hard it is to make drugs for complex diseases. It’s extraordinarily sad how many otherwise brilliant kids might not do things they could because they don’t have a similarly supportive environment — I’m really excited for things like <a href="https://dcgross.com/">Daniel Gross</a>’s <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> for that reason. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/image.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/image.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/image.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w2000/2020/06/image.png 2000w"><figcaption>Laura as a child, drawing DNA on the pavement outside of her house in chalk, an anecdote from a talk that she gave for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwslKJut8eM">TedxYouth@Tallinn</a>.

And then starting to think more independently in college, and to try to figure out what problems I wanted to work on. But I had this moment around that time where a friend and I were driving to a camping site, and I was trying to explain a math concept to him, and he abruptly turned to me and said “I’m feeling very frustrated right now because you honestly have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”<em> </em></p><p>It’s really hard to explain without context how actually useful that comment was. As he explained it, I was just parroting off the definition of something. The real way to understand things is to be able to see, explore, feel the concept from a bunch of different angles, and to be able to rigorously prove things about it. I still struggle with the latter, but having an intuition for what <em>real, deep </em>understanding of a concept looks like has been a great guidepost. For example, I realized I didn’t understand what entropy was, and now kind of do, after a summer of being in near tears with frustration about it. </p><h3 id="where-and-when-did-your-mission-to-improve-longevity-originate">Where and when did your mission to improve longevity originate?</h3><p>It’s funny, because I get asked that question a lot. I think of it like this: if you were to watch a million people jump off a bridge every day and just suffer in a really extreme way throughout all of it, How would we respond as a society? An overwhelming number of people would be inspired to take action and help. When you think of it in acute, immediate terms, viscerally shocking and moving. But with longevity and other deeply existential problems, the horror of what’s happening has been tragically normalized.</p><p>I really just wanted to work on the biggest problem possible. At first I thought that was cancer, but after a variety of experiences, aging just seemed like a bigger deal.</p><p>I have a much less antagonistic relationship with death now than I did when I was a kid. I understand more that we are a species, that there’s something beyond us as individuals — but despite that, I absolutely cannot square the idea of sobbing when a relative gets cancer and then being totally fine with another debilitating degenerative disease also caused by aging that we somehow have collectively decided is natural and normal.</p><h3 id="how-has-the-way-you-learned-as-a-kid-shaped-the-way-you-learn-and-make-decisions-at-the-helm-of-the-longevity-fund">How has the way you learned as a kid shaped the way you learn and make decisions at the helm of The Longevity Fund?</h3><p>I’ve had to un-learn a bunch of stuff I learned when I first came to the professional world. As a kid, I was deeply joyous about science. I loved it directly and with a passion, and I absolutely believed I was going to grow up to be like Michael Faraday (his story about <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/people-of-science-michael-faraday-the-royal-society/HQLyLIo6MWpoKw?hl=en">getting an apprenticeship with Humphrey Davy</a> is amazing, by the way). When I entered the world of finance with my fund, I was totally scared to seem like I didn’t know what I was doing, and I felt like it was really important to hide who I was to seem more ‘adult’. Now, in retrospect, I think that was both understandable and a bit of a mistake.</p><p>One thing I learned as a kid that I keep on forgetting so easily is how not to care about what anyone else thinks (with a few close exceptions). It’s funny - even in Silicon Valley, hypothetically the vanguard of independent thought, I feel like that’s extremely hard to do. In part, because what other people think constrains your access to resources. So it’s an interesting balance. </p><h3 id="i-ve-heard-you-talk-about-your-dad-telling-you-at-12-years-old-to-make-sure-that-everyone-was-a-little-bit-happier-because-you-were-in-the-lab-each-day-what-role-did-your-parents-play-in-your-life-and-education">I’ve heard you talk about your dad telling you at 12 years old to make sure that everyone was a little bit happier because you were in the lab each day. What role did your parents play in your life and education?</h3><p>Oh, man. My Dad had so much good advice as a kid — I really felt like I got a cheat code to life early on. It was like being Ben Franklin’s daughter or something. I’m probably exaggerating, but it felt that way. </p><p>One thing he told me was ‘action comes before motivation’ - that’s always been an incredibly powerful thing in my life. He taught me a lot about putting your head down and working hard and not believing anyone who tells you you are great, having that come mostly from your own self-judgment. Being extremely humble around people who know more, finding any way on earth to help them. </p><p>My dad also taught me a lot about humor and how ridiculous the world was in so many different ways. Almost too much - I think I take things more seriously now. But it’s kind of the Mark Twain effect - the world and everyone in it is a hilarious, self-sabotaging, foolhardy place that is also one of the most deeply joyous and interesting things going on in the galaxy. He used to say you can either look at what’s going on in the world and cry or laugh. Why not pick the latter?</p><p>My mom taught me about kindness and empathy and wanting to help others. She’s probably the most giving person I know. </p><p>When I first met Cynthia Kenyon, who literally changed my and many other lives – she’s amazing – I had this very extreme mental conceit that I would beg her to scrub floors in her lab and somehow work my way up on the academic ladder. I was 12. She very kindly offered for me to just work in her lab as a normal intern, which was so kind in retrospect. It changed my life, to be taken seriously like that at a young age. </p><h3 id="i-love-how-you-describe-the-way-the-longevity-fund-removes-limits-on-who-can-participate-in-biomedical-entrepreneurship-how-can-we-translate-some-of-what-you-ve-learned-about-diverse-participation-in-science-to-the-way-that-kids-learn">I love how you describe the way The Longevity Fund removes limits on who can participate in biomedical entrepreneurship. How can we translate some of what you’ve learned about diverse participation in science to the way that kids learn?</h3><p>I think there’s something about being absolutely delighted when you meet someone who doesn’t know something. That feeling is the best thing in the world because <em>you get to be the first person to tell them about some incredibly cool natural phenomenon</em>. That’s pretty great. I still remember being a preteen in Cynthia’s lab when Marc McCormick described how SVMs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machines</a>) worked for handwriting recognition in the postal system. He was just so good at explaining things, and that really stuck. Encourage people to own ideas, be skeptical of them, and learn to delight in poking holes in things.<br></p><p>When thinking about diverse participation, it’s funny – before I came to the Valley, I had absolutely no idea that being a girl was in any way a handicap. To me, it was an obvious advantage – in a sea of people who all looked the same way, I’d stick out like a sore thumb! If I could make it, wouldn’t I obviously be an amazing role model? Being in the valley for a while, it kind of wore off, and the more articles I read about how much it sucked to be a girl in science, the more I believed it. I’m not sure what to think about all of that, really. </p><h3 id="what-s-something-you-believe-that-most-people-don-t">What’s something you believe that most people don’t?</h3><p>I can give you a few!</p><ol><li>That we will see the first drug to measurably affect <a href="https://publichealth.wustl.edu/heatlhspan-is-more-important-than-lifespan-so-why-dont-more-people-know-about-it/">human healthspan</a> tested in the next decade, and that this is one of the biggest deals in how we thinking about disease.

							<p>Giant weather balloons have been used for almost 100 years, performing experiments and helping to track storms and weather patterns. But in all the years of high-altitude ballooning, only 20 people have reached the 100,000 foot height stratosphere, where you can see the earth’s curve, and take in our magnificent planet.</p>
<p>That’s about to change thanks to <strong><a href="https://thespaceperspective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Perspective</a></strong>, a private company that will begin launching in 2021. For around $150,000 per person, the futuristic Neptune balloon and capsule will launch eight people and a captain to the edge of space, for a six hour journey that will change your life.</p>

<p>The pressurized capsule will have all the modern comforts of an airplane, including a lavatory and bar, making this much more relaxed than spaceflight, and opening up the travel possibilities to average (wealthy) citizens. The balloon swells to the size of a football stadium (!!) at its largest, and the Neptune system is equipped with an array of safety equipment, should anything go wrong. Another advantage of the system is that is nearly zero emissions, which can’t be said of other space travel.</p>
<p>The company also hopes to open the travel options for scientists as well, performing experiments onboard the capsule.</p>

<blockquote><p>Before sun rise, eight Explorers and a Pilot climb aboard the Neptune Capsule, recline in the plush seats and lift off into the predawn sky. Neptune ascends for two hours to over three times higher than a commercial airliner flies while the sky is still dark, and stars are visible like you’ve never before seen them.</p>
<p>As Neptune glides along the edge of space, the sun slowly rises over the curved limb of Earth, scattering rainbow colors of light across the planet and illuminating the thin, bright blue line of our atmosphere. And the sky remains black, completely inky black.</p>
<p>This view of Earth in the void of space has transfixed astronauts since the dawn of the space age. Reluctantly, the Explorers and Pilot prepare to leave space to return to Earth.&nbsp;Neptune gently descends under the balloon, and two hours later splashes down, where a ship retrieves the capsule, balloon and Explorers.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Note: This is an old post originally from the documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> programming language, that I've touched up and fleshed out. After the time that it was written I've found out about <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a>, a Rust library with very similar goals to my Rock library, which is definitely worth checking out as well!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Compilers are no longer just black boxes that take a bunch of source files and produce assembly code. We expect them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be incremental, meaning that if we recompile a project after having made a few changes we only recompile what is affected by the changes.</li>
<li>Provide editor tooling, e.g. through a <a href="https://langserver.org/">language server</a>, supporting functionality like going to definition, finding the type of the expression at a specific location, and showing error messages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what Anders Hejlsberg talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdV1M7n4gQ">his video on modern compiler construction</a> that some of you might have seen.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover how this is achieved in <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> by building the compiler around a query system.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know, Sixten is an experimental functional programming language created to give the programmer more control over memory layout and boxing than most other high-level languages do. The most recent development of Sixten is being done in the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixty">Sixty</a> repository, and is completely query-based. Here's a little video giving a taste of what its language server can do, showing type-based completions:</p>

<h2 id="traditional-pipeline-based-compiler-architectures">Traditional pipeline-based compiler architectures</h2>
<p>A traditional compiler pipeline might look a bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>+-----------+            +-----+                +--------+               +--------+</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>|           |            |     |                |        |               |        |</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>|source text|---parse---&gt;| AST |---typecheck-+-&gt;|core AST|---generate---&gt;|assembly|</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>|           |            |     |       ^        |        |               |        |</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>+-----------+            +-----+       |        +--------+               +---------</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a>                                 read and write</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a>                                     types</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10"></a>                                       v</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>                                  +----------+</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a>                                  |type table|</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a>                                  +----------+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many variations, and often more steps and intermediate representations than in the illustration, but the idea stays the same:</p>
<p>We push source text down a pipeline and run a fixed set of transformations until we finally output assembly code or some other target language. Along the way we often need to read and update some state. For example, we might update a type table during type checking so we can later look up the type of entities that the code refers to.</p>
<p>Traditional compiler pipelines are probably quite familiar to many of us, but how query-based compilers should be architected might not be as well-known. Here I will describe one way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="going-from-pipeline-to-queries">Going from pipeline to queries</h2>
<p>What does it take to get the type of a qualified name, such as <code>"Data.List.map"</code>? In a pipeline-based architecture we would just look it up in the type table. With queries, we have to think differently. Instead of relying on having updated some piece of state, we do it as if it was done from scratch.</p>
<p>As a first iteration, we do it <em>completely</em> from scratch. It might look a little bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> parseModule sourceCode</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We first find out what file the name comes from, which might be <code>Data/List.vix</code> for <code>Data.List</code>, then read the contents of the file, parse it, perhaps we do name resolution to find out what the names in the code refer to given what is imported, and last we look up the name-resolved definition and type check it, returning its type.</p>
<p>All this for just for getting the type of an identifier? It seems ridiculous because looking up the type of a name is something we'll do loads of times during the type checking of a module. Luckily we're not done yet.</p>
<p>Let's first refactor the code into smaller functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>fetchParsedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>fetchParsedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a>  parseModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>fetchResolvedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a>fetchResolvedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-10"><a href="#cb3-10"></a>  resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-11"><a href="#cb3-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-12"><a href="#cb3-12"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14"><a href="#cb3-14"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-15"><a href="#cb3-15"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-16"><a href="#cb3-16"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that each of the functions do everything from scratch on their own, i.e. they're each doing a (longer and longer) prefix of the work you'd do in a pipeline. I've found this to be a common pattern in my query-based compilers.</p>
<p>One way to make this efficient would be to add a memoisation layer around each function. That way, we do some expensive work the first time we invoke a function with a specific argument, but subsequent calls are cheap as they can return the cached result.</p>
<p>This is essentially what we'll do, but we won't use a separate cache per function, but instead have a central cache, indexed by the query. This functionality is provided by <a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a>, a library that packages up some functionality for creating query-based compilers.</p>
<h2 id="the-rock-library">The Rock library</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a> is an experimental library heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake">Shake</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build systems à la carte paper</a>. It essentially implements a build system framework, like <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>Build systems have a lot in common with modern compilers since we want them to be incremental, i.e. to take advantage of previous build results when building anew with few changes. But there's also a difference: Most build systems don't care about the <em>types</em> of their queries since they work at the level of files and file systems.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is closer to what we want. There the user writes a bunch of computations, <em>tasks</em>, choosing a suitable type for keys and a type for values. The tasks are formulated assuming they're run in an environment where there is a function <code>fetch</code> of type <code>Key -&gt; Task Value</code>, where <code>Task</code> is a type for describing build system rules, that can be used to fetch the value of a dependency with a specific key. In our above example, the key type might look like this:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>TypeKey</span> <span>QualifiedName</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The build system has control over what code runs when we do a <code>fetch</code>, so by varying that it can do fine-grained dependency tracking, memoisation, and incremental updates.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is also about exploring what kind of build systems we get when we vary what <code>Task</code> is allowed to do, e.g. if it's a <code>Monad</code> or <code>Applicative</code>. In Rock, we're not exploring <em>that</em>, so our <code>Task</code> is a thin layer on top of <code>IO</code>.</p>
<p>A problem that pops up now, however, is that there's no satisfactory type for <code>Value</code>. We want <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code> to return a <code>ParsedModule</code>, while <code>fetch (TypeKey "Data.List.map")</code> should return something of type <code>Type</code>.</p>
<h3 id="indexed-queries">Indexed queries</h3>
<p>Rock allows us to index the key type by the return type of the query. The <code>Key</code> type in our running example becomes the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>

<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>Type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>fetch</code> function gets the type <code>forall a. Key a -&gt; Task a</code>, so we get a <code>ParsedModule</code> when we run <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code>, like we wanted, because the return type depends on the key we use.</p>
<p>Now that we know what <code>fetch</code> should look like, it's also worth revealing what the <code>Task</code> type looks like in Rock, more concretely. As mentioned, it's a thin layer around <code>IO</code>, providing a way to <code>fetch</code> <code>key</code>s (like <code>Key</code> above):</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> key a <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> {<span> unTask ::</span> <span>ReaderT</span> (<span>Fetch</span> key) <span>IO</span> a }</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Fetch</span> key <span>=</span> <span>Fetch</span> (<span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> key a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rules of our compiler, i.e. its "Makefile", then becomes the following function, reusing the functions from above:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>rules ::</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> a</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>rules key <span>=</span> <span>case</span> key <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>    fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>    fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span> qualifiedName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10"></a>    fetchType qualifiedName</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>The most basic way to run a <code>Task</code> in Rock is to directly call the <code>rules</code> function when a <code>Task</code> fetches a key. This results in an inefficient build system that recomputes every query from scratch.</p>
<p>But the <code>Rock</code> library lets us layer more functionality onto our <code>rules</code> function, and one thing that we can add is memoisation. If we do that Rock caches the result of each fetched key by storing the key-value pairs of already performed fetches in a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-hashmap">dependent hashmap</a>. This way, we perform each query at most once during a single run of the compiler.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-dependencies-and-reusing-state">Verifying dependencies and reusing state</h3>
<p>Another kind of functionality that can be layered onto the <code>rules</code> function is incremental updates. When it's used, Rock keeps track of what dependencies a task used when it was executed (much like Shake) in a table, i.e. what keys it fetched and what the values were. Using this information it's able to determine when it's safe to reuse the cache <em>from a previous run of the compiler</em> even though there might be changes in other parts of the dependency graph.</p>
<p>This fine-grained dependency tracking also allows reusing the cache when a dependency of a task changes in a way that has no effect. For example, whitespace changes might trigger a re-parse, but since the AST is the same, the cache can be reused in queries that depend on the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As startups become viral, we see MVP and Beta versions everywhere. However, a lot of founders misuse these terms. Some even use them as synonyms. In this article, we will explain what MVP and Beta are and also the differences between them. Let's start with MVP:</p><h2>Minimum Viable Product</h2><p>Minimum Viable Product, (MVP) is often misused by a lot of people. To be clear,&nbsp;<strong>MVP is not a prototype, not a beta version, but rather an experiment</strong>&nbsp;designed to test your value proposition’s assumptions by measuring behavior and learning from the results. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy9nSnalvPc">this video</a>&nbsp;of Dropbox is their MVP. It is a banal video that lasts 3 minutes. But it is a video that was made for early adopters of Dropbox. It is clear what it does, its features, and its benefits for the early adopters. At the time there was no service like Dropbox so founders wanted to test if there is an audience that faces the same problem so they, hopefully, sell it to them. After this video, there was a crowd waiting for Dropbox to launch so the video worked well for founders to understand if there is a demand for their product. The experiment was successful. Another great example is&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991127151543/http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos' MVP from 1999</a>. Their MVP was a simple landing page where you can understand that Zappos is an online shoe store and their unique selling point is being the world's largest shoe store. With this landing page, they experiment to validate their idea. They posted their landing page on websites that are relevant to online shopping and bought some ads. After all, they validated the idea: There was an audience that wants to buy shoes online!</p><p><img src="https://tractific.com/res/images/5eea4454a93dd3d3b38982db_1.png" alt="MVP Presentation"><span>From Drew Houston's presentation on their MVP.</span></p><h3>Key takeaway:</h3><ul><li>MVP is an experiment designed to validate your idea.</li><li>MVP can be in a lot of forms like a landing page or a video.</li><li>MVP must explain what does the product does and who is the product for.</li></ul><h2>Beta</h2><p>On the other hand, the beta version is launched after the idea is validated and an amount of contact is collected. Beta is no longer an experiment, it is a product with fewer features. You can launch beta after collecting emails of potential customers with your MVP version. What you should focus on beta are feedbacks and feature requests you receive from beta users. To use the power of word-of-mouth, you should treat your beta users as royalty. You should contact them often and ask them about their experience.</p><h3>An example of the beta process:</h3><ul><li>project planning</li><li>participant recruitment</li><li>product distribution</li><li>collecting feedback</li><li>analyzing feedback</li><li>drawing a conclusion</li></ul><p>After completing a cycle of this process you should go back and start the next cycle until you are sure about your beta and ready to launch the full version.</p><h2>Differences</h2><h3>Nature of the product</h3><p>In MVP you are possibly not building even a version of the product, but in beta, you are coming out with a product version based on your learning/ insights until then.</p><h3>Goals</h3><p>In MVP your goal is to validate your idea and to decide whether to develop the product or not. In the beta version, your goal is to collect feedback and add features.</p><h3>Target group</h3><p>In MVP your target group is early adopters who, have a pain point that you can solve. In the beta version, your target group is beta testers, who can find bugs and next features</p><h3>Minimalism</h3><p>A lot of entrepreneurs wait until they develop the best to launch their MVP. However, this approach is against the nature of the MVP. Your MVP should only validate the idea, whereas your beta version should have features that can keep your potential customers in your product long enough to find bugs and give feedback.</p><p><img src="https://tractific.com/res/images/5eea4454a93dd3d3b38982db_2.png" alt="MVP vs Beta Pyramid"></p><h2>TL; DR,</h2><p>MVP and beta are two different things. They cannot be used as synonyms. MVP is an experiment to validate an idea, whereas the beta version is to collect feedback before launch. Knowing the difference and using them appropriately will help you communicate the product roadmap better with team members and early users.</p><p><em>Stay Optimized!</em></p></div><p>Join early Tractific users getting product updates, blog posts, and free access to beta.</p></div>]]>

  <article>
    <p>This article is going to explore using <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">winston</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> to do
“structured logging” in Node.js.  The basic idea is that we want to write logs
with some metadata attached to them, beyond just a timestamp, a level, and a message.</p>

<p>The traditional “twelve factors” approach to logging is just to write your logs
to stdout, and let some extrenal process deal with logging.  For example, you
might use fluentd to read stdout on all your processes and write the results
into Elasticsearch.  This works well, and it works across different projects
written in different languages.  But, with a little extra work, we can write
some extra information into those logs.</p>

<p>For example, for every request we could write the URL of the request to the log
as <code>request.url</code>, and then write the response time in milliseconds as
<code>response.responseTime</code>, and now it’s a simple mater to generate an
Elasticsearch graph showing our average and max response time to HTTP requests,
or even to write a query which finds the top ten slowest routes in our system.
Or we could write a <code>user</code> field to the log on every request, so we can figure
out which users in our system are most active.</p>

<h2 id="structured-logging-with-winston">Structured logging with Winston</h2>

<p>We’re going to use winston as the heart of our logging engine.  Firsts, let’s
play around a little with winston so you can get a quick idea of what we can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>winston</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>createLogger</span><span>();</span>

<span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And if you try running this, you’ll get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span>winston] Attempt to write logs with no transports <span>{</span><span>"level"</span>:<span>"info"</span>,<span>"message"</span>:<span>"Hello world!"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, that didn’t go so well.  What’s all this about transports?</p>

<p>Basically, you can think of winston as a stream; you write logs into it, and it
streams out log events to one or more “transports”.  In fact, Transport
<a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston-transport/blob/master/index.d.ts#L11">just extends <code>stream.Writable</code></a>.
Let’s add a console transport so we can see logs on stdout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>winston</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>createLogger</span><span>({</span>
    <span>transports</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>transports</span><span>.</span><span>Console</span><span>({}),</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now we get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>"level"</span>:<span>"info"</span>,<span>"message"</span>:<span>"Hello world!"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a little bit better, but we’re still looking at a raw JSON event.  In
additon to “transports”, winston has this concept called a “format”.  You can add
a format (or multiple formats via <code>winston.format.combine()</code>) to a transport.
Each format will receive a copy of each event before it’s passed to the transport,
and can modify fields, or even add or remove fields.  Let’s add some formats
to our logger to print out pretty messages to the console:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>winston</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>debugFormat</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston-format-debug</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>createLogger</span><span>({</span>
    <span>transports</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>transports</span><span>.</span><span>Console</span><span>({</span>
            <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>.</span><span>combine</span><span>(</span>
                <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>.</span><span>colorize</span><span>({</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> <span>}),</span>
                <span>debugFormat</span><span>({</span>
                    <span>colorizeMessage</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>// Already colored by `winston.format.colorize`.</span>
                <span>})</span>
            <span>)</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Jun 24 14:27:38 node[94522] INFO:    Hello world!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So now we have something “human readable”.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen that we can add a “message” and a “level” to a log event.
What else can we add? It turns out we can add whatever we like. If we try:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>test</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>This is a test</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Jun 24 14:29:18 node[94522] ERROR:   Hello world!
    <span>test</span>: <span>"This is a test"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can add any literally any fields we want here. It’s up to the format and the
transport to decide what to do with those fields.  Formats can also modify fields.
You could write, for example a <a href="https://github.com/jwalton/node-jwalton-logger/blob/master/src/logging/format/prefixFormat.ts">format to prefix all the “tags” in an event onto “message”</a>
to show them in stdout, or a <a href="https://github.com/jwalton/node-jwalton-logger/blob/master/src/logging/format/requestFormat.ts">format to replace a <code>request</code> object with a pretty-printed string</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-winston-to-elasticsearch">From Winston to Elasticsearch</h2>

<p>To get our logs out to elasticsearch, we need to do a few things.  First, we
need to decide exactly what fields we want to store in elasticsearch, and write
a template for our index.  This helps Elasticsearch figure out what type each
value in our log entry is.  Also we set <code>number_of_shards: 1</code> here - these are
just logs, so there’s no real need to duplicate these across multiple shards or
replicas.  Also, Elasticsearch generates an index for every field in every message,
so we want to limit what we send to Elasticsearch to something “well defined” to
stop our memory usage from spiraling out of control.</p>

    <span>},</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we can create a “format” which will take in an object with a <code>request</code>, and
a <code>response</code>, and will format them according to this template:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// esFormat.ts</span>

<p>Finally we can create an elasticsearch transport to add to our logger, to
actually get our logs to elasticsearch.</p>

<p>And now anything we log will be automatically sent to elasticsearch, in full
structured glory.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>One thing be aware of with this approach.  Notice if you do something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>error</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Ohs noes!</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>});</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here there’s no chance for the elasticsearch transport to send a network request
to elasticsearch before you <code>process.exit(1)</code>, so your error log is not going
to go anywhere.  You can get around this by using the <code>callback</code> form of <code>logger.log</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>error</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Ohs noes!</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>},</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, also, if your node.js process crashes beacuse of an uncaught
exception or because it runs out of memory, it will print an …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>The first time I used <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/">ASGI</a>(<em>Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface</em>) was through <a href="https://github.com/django/channels">Channels</a> 1.0 when ASGI spec was still a draft. It was my first interview project which helped me get my current job at <a href="https://fellow.app/">Fellow</a>. It felt magical at that time how easy it is to add WebSocket functionality to my Django app and handles authentication and other Django related things for me seamlessly.</p>

<p>ASGI specification is now at version 3 at the time of writing and both ASGI and Channels became part of Django Software Foundation. Compared to the draft version, it has matured a lot with added lifecycle calls and better application format, etc. Most excitingly, a healthy and fast-growing community is forming and we are seeing more and more ASGI servers running in production environments. At my company, we are serving a few million requests per day through ASGI running on <a href="https://github.com/django/daphne">Daphne</a>, Netflix’s <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Dispatch</a> is based on <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, a popular ASGI web application framework, and apparently, Microsoft is <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26">using it</a> too.</p>

<p>I would humbly advise anyone building web services in Python to learn about ASGI. And the best way to learn something is to built things with it, so in this blog post, I’ll walk through the steps to build a micro web application framework that speaks ASGI. I hope it can help explain how ASGI works.</p>


<p>Before writing the first line of code, we need to have a basic understanding of what ASGI is and what we are building towards.</p>
<h2 id="how-asgi-works">How ASGI works</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple diagram showing how ASGI works at a high level.</p>
<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Client] --&gt;|HTTP, WebSocket, ...| B(ASGI Server)
	B --&gt; |scope, send, receive| C(ASGI application)
</code></pre>
<p>To put it in simple words, A browser(client), establishes a connection to ASGI server with a certain type of request (HTTP or WebSocket), the ASGI server then calls ASGI  application with information about the connection, encapsulated in a python dictionary called <code>scope</code>, and two callbacks, named <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, that the application can use to send and receive messages between server and client.</p>

<p>Here’s an example HTTP request scope</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"http_version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"server"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>8000</span><span>),</span>
    <span>"client"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>60457</span><span>),</span>
    <span>"scheme"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"root_path"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"path"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/hello/a"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"raw_path"</span><span>:</span> <span>b"/hello/a"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"headers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"host"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"localhost:8000"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"connection"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"keep-alive"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"user-agent"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.106 Safari/537.36"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"accept"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"accept-encoding"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"gzip, deflate, br"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"accept-language"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"en-US,en;q=0.9"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"cookie"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b'csrftoken=dDA2IAPrvgPc7hkyBSyctxDk78KmhHAzUqR0LUpjXI3Xgki0QrGEWazE3RGZuLGl'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
    <span>],</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might notice that <code>scope</code> is not too different from a WSGI <code>environ</code>. In fact, ASGI interface is very similar to WSGI interface, but instead of getting a <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> to send headers and using the return value of WSGI application as the response body, ASGI interfaces with the connection and allows us to receive and send messages multiple times during the lifecycle of the connection <strong>asynchronously</strong> until the connection is closed.  This allows a nice interface for both WebSocket and HTTP.</p>

<p>It’s also totally possible to wrap a WSGI application inside an ASGI application, just prepare a WSGI <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> based on <code>scope</code>, <code>receive</code>, and <code>send</code> then call the WSGI application and it would work. If you delegate that call into a thread pool or something similar, you just made your WSGI application asynchronous. This is roughly how Channels wraps around Django.</p>

<h2 id="define-asgi-framework">Define ASGI framework</h2>
<p>When I say ASGI framework I refer it as a framework that makes building ASGI application easier and this does not include the ASGI server part. I’m mentioning this because some of the earlier Python asynchronous web frameworks have their own server implementation that also takes over tasks such as parsing  HTTP requests, handles network connections, etc. We are not doing those in ASGI web framework. As a spiritual successor to WSGI, where web servers, such as Gunicorn and uwsgi, and web frameworks, such as Flask and Django, are separated, ASGI has this separation too.</p>

<p>So, what does an ASGI application look like?</p>

<h3 id="asgi-hello-world">ASGI Hello World</h3>
<p>A simple ASGI hello world application can be written as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>application</span><span>(</span><span>scope</span><span>,</span> <span>receive</span><span>,</span> <span>send</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>scope</span><span>[</span><span>"path"</span><span>].</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>or</span> <span>"world"</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.start"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"status"</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"headers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[[</span><span>b"content-type"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"text/plain"</span><span>],],</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.body"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"body"</span><span>:</span> <span>f"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"more_body"</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>http.response.start</code> starts an HTTP response sending status code and response headers. In this example, it responds with the 200 OK status code and  has <code>content-type</code> set to <code>text/plain</code> in the headers.  <code>http.response.body</code> sends the response body, the <code>more_body</code> key tells the server if the response is finished. ASGI server might use this to know if a connection should be closed or automatically decide between a <code>content-length</code> header or a chunked encoding.</p>

<p>We can run the application with <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">uvicorn</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>uvicorn asgi-hello:application
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And you should be able to visit <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> and get <code>Hello, world</code>.Visiting <code>http://localhost:8000/tom</code> would get you <code>Hello, tom</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, uvicorn is pretty fast, a simple benchmark with <code>wrk -d10s http://localhost:8000/hi</code> on a 2018 lowest spec MacBook Air yields <code>Requests/sec:  27857.87</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this approach works with a simple hello world example, it’s not exactly convenient to write a more complex application this way. For one, it doesn’t do routing, if you want to respond differently for different paths, you’ll probably end up with a huge  <code>if ... else if ... else</code> clause. Secondly, having to write the ASGI message every time in the form of a python dict is quite arduous. Third, in a complex application, it gets harder to track the status of the connection, such as is the response started, is the response ended, should I start the response here, etc.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>With the new framework, I hope to be able to write an ASGI application like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>from</span> <span>aaf</span> <span>import</span> <span>aaf</span> <span># Another ASGI framework
</span><span>from</span> <span>aaf.routing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Router</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>HttpResponse</span><span>(</span><span>f"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>aaf</span><span>([</span><span>router</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I hope this snippet of how I want the framework to look like is self-explanatory. But here are some of the key things I want to achieve:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It should be able to handle HTTP response declaratively and imperatively.</li>
  <li>It should support Flask style routing with parameter parsing.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="connection-class">Connection class</h2>
<p>The <code>Connection</code> class will represent an ASGI HTTP or WebSocket connection. It’s a class that encapsulates the three basic elements in ASGI, namely <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, and expose some convenient methods and properties so that users don’t need to verbosely write out all the ASGI messages and parse everything, such as cookies and headers, from <code>scope</code>. But it should allow users to access the original <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> when they want to, so that the composability of ASGI applications is maintained. For example, it should allow user to delegate certain <code>connection</code>s to another ASGI application by calling <code>another_asgi_app(connection.scope, connectionn.asgi_send, connection.asgi_receive)</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple implementation of the <code>Connection</code> class.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Test-driven development was supposed to eliminate the need for independent testing. Alas, it doesn’t go far enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) earned a reputation of making software more robust. Does that mean you can fire all the testers? Spoiler: No.</p>
<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test-driven development</a> is a method for writing software in small chunks. You start with a test, then write functional code to make the test pass, and finally refactor the functional code to clean it up. The idea of TDD was proposed by <a href="https://amzn.to/3doabIA" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Beck</a> in the early 1990s, as part of Extreme Programming, an Agile software development methodology.</p>
<p>TDD is sometimes summarized as “Red, Green, Refactor.” The interfaces on many testing harnesses, such as JUnit (for Java) and NUnit (for .NET), show red lights when tests fail and green lights when tests pass. There’s another step to consider, however. You need to think about the desired behavior and carve out a small chunk of code – typically five lines – to implement next.</p>
<p>As proposed by Beck, in TDD you never write functional code until you have a failing test. Yet, it takes practice to learn to write the tests first (rather than after the fact); developers often have trouble shifting their habitual way of working. Writing the tests before the functional code just feels <em>wrong.</em> You do get used to it, though it may take months; by then it starts feeling <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-test-driven-development-tdd/">biggest benefit of TDD</a> is that it removes the fear of breaking your code. As you add unit tests and functional code, you also build <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/dont-fail-your-next-interview-know-what-differentiates-regression-testing-from-retesting/">a library of regression tests</a> that you run frequently. When you add a new feature, fix a bug, or refactor to clean up your code, running the tests again reassures you that you didn’t break anything. Or at least it confirms that you didn’t break any of the tests that <em>you</em> wrote.</p>
<h3>What do testers bring to the table?</h3>
<p>Software managers are sometimes tempted to eliminate or reduce software QA departments when the coders adopt TDD, on the grounds that the programmers are also writing tests. That decision usually is a mistake, because <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">testers provide value</a> outside of the developers’ unit tests.</p>
<p>Unit tests are only one of the kinds of tests needed to adequately cover modern code. TDD developers rarely write end-to-end integration tests. They may avoid writing unit tests that require significant setup or that rely on other software components, such as a populated database.</p>
<p>Dedicated testers are more likely than coders to take the time to perform exploratory (ad-hoc) testing, which can find bugs that weren’t imagined during the development of the code. Testers also come to the product with fresh eyes compared to the coders who have been immersed in the software for long hours.</p>
<p>Additionally, software developers often are not interested in setting up CI/CD tooling or in organizing the team’s tests into a master regression test. Testers consider all of that to be part of the job. Developers may not be involved in implementing shift left testing beyond TDD. &nbsp;For shift left testing, testers can gather information, help with requirements management, and help to define the acceptance criteria, before a single test or line of functional code is complete.</p>
<h3>What bugs do testers find that TDD doesn’t?</h3>
<p>Security is one large, important testing area that isn’t normally addressed by writing unit tests. Testers look for security flaws with automated vulnerability testing tools, manual security assessments, penetration tests, security audits, and security reviews.</p>
<p>It’s difficult for developers to write <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">unit tests to test GUIs</a>. Instead, testers use automation tools specific to the supported application environments, such as browsers, desktop applications, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Developers can have a hard time with hardware-dependent bugs, as the dominant way of working is for a coder to work on a single machine. QA departments often collect rooms full of varied computers and devices, as well as images of many operating system versions. An alternative way of testing on many different model devices is to use a crowd-sourced testing service.</p>
<p>While TDD can theoretically catch bugs in edge cases, they are called “edge cases” for a good reason. When a coder designs the tests for a function point, obscure edge cases may escape notice in the heat of the moment. Testers are more likely to find these than are the coders who wrote the software.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-module flaws can sometimes escape scrutiny in unit tests. They can easily arise when one programmer misunderstands the interface or boundary conditions of another programmer’s module. Cross-module bugs are often found during end-to-end testing and ad-hoc testing.</p>
<p>In summary, while there’s a lot to be said for TDD as a development practice, it doesn’t usually provide complete test coverage of your code. For that, you still need testers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever writes the test cases, it makes sense to follow established guidelines. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/best-practices-for-effective-test-case-writing/">These</a> might help.</p></blockquote>

					<p><em>Based on my lecture at Topos House, San Francisco on February 29, 2020.</em></p>
<p>Not all fields of knowledge exist yet. If you tried to study biochemistry in 1820, you’d have a lot of trouble: the field had yet to cohere. Do we think that all the biochemistries of the world have been discovered? If we did back then, we’d be wrong. For those seeking a safe career, sticking to the established fields is probably the right move. But for those interested in pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, it will sometimes be better to work in a field that has not yet cohered, or in a field on the cusp of crystallizing. Often the best intellectual opportunities — if you want to be a breakthrough researcher — and the largest economic opportunities — if you want to build a great company — are going to be precisely in those areas about to crystallize into a new field.</p>
<p>If you went into biochemistry when biochemistry was emerging, your name might be in a textbook today. You didn’t have to be brilliant; you just had to pick your problem well. The greatest difficulty would be in figuring out who to learn from. Before you figure out where and how to learn, you have to decide <a href="http://samoburja.com/on-the-loss-and-preservation-of-knowledge/">who has the knowledge</a> you seek. When the field of biochemistry was on the cusp of crystallizing, for example, you would have looked to experts in the fields of biology and chemistry. But as an outsider, who are you to evaluate the quality of a field? Just because a field claims to exist, doesn’t mean it exists.</p>
<h3>Evaluating Existing Fields</h3>
<p>One thing you can do is look at how a field performs on its own criteria. Take the replication crisis in academic psychology for example. In academic science, replicability has been one of the gold standards both for internal bureaucratic targets and also for the layman’s understanding of the philosophy of science. Philosophy of science might not seem very important, but it is key to figuring out how we know what we know, and what is good science as opposed to bad science. There is, in fact, no consensus philosophy of science, which means that there is no canonical science of science.</p>
<p>But surely scientists must know how science works? Well, scientists might know how science works in the way that birds know how aerodynamics works. They know it, but not at all on a conscious level — they just fly. Even if birds could speak, their answers might be quite useless, even to baby birds. Their knowledge is not formatted for scientific understanding; it remains locked away as a type of <a href="http://samoburja.com/intellectual-dark-matter/">intellectual dark matter</a>. If you are deciding whether to enter a field in which you are not yet an expert, you need a more precise epistemic foundation than a bird’s intuition, especially when deciding where expertise truly resides.</p>
<p>A thought experiment: say you had five experimental planes in front of you. How do you decide which one to board? Is it the wooden one, the bamboo one, the steel one, the large one with smoke-puffing engines, or the modest one made by the bicycle shop owners? The Wright brothers were bicycle shop owners, and they built a janky-looking machine. Plenty of the other early flying machines looked vastly more impressive than theirs, but they didn’t fly. In the case of deciding which of these early flying machines to board, relying on institutional claims to epistemic authority would not work—not even the ones made by Harvard professors could fly.</p>
<p>When making such decisions, you cannot assume that the members of prestigious institutions of your society are experts simply because they claim to be experts. They would claim to be experts whether they were or weren’t! In any period of human history, if you examine how institutions portray their own expertise, they always portray themselves as tremendously knowledgeable with impeccable foundations. In the rare cases where they do admit to not knowing something they propose it to be either unknowable or, to be knowable—but only if you give them more funding. The Catholic Church would claim this when it came to metaphysics and the question of salvation. Today, the Church of Scientology claims that Scientology is at the productive frontier of psychology, that they’ve disproven psychiatry, and that they have these cutting-edge, electronic brain-measuring devices. And so would a university cognitive science department.</p>
<p>We all make choices using dumb heuristics, but importantly, they are often good enough for everyday life. If you choose to study history at Oxford because the buildings look old, you’ll likely do pretty well. Rules of thumb such as “Are the buildings old?” can have a valid core. The heuristic isn’t a bad one for the prospective historian to use: old buildings often come with libraries well-stocked with old books. But does this heuristic hold in other cases?</p>
<p>Say you are deciding between Harvard and MIT for studying astrophysics, and you view Harvard as the better pick. Why do you believe this? Is it because Harvard has older-looking buildings? We can imagine that some prospective astrophysicists, too, are swayed by Harvard’s historic appearance. Much of academia, in fact, functions on such <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">cargo cult</a> heuristics. Maybe one <i>should</i> study astrophysics at Harvard, rather than MIT. But if this is so, then it’s right by accident: the “old buildings” heuristic doesn’t apply to astrophysics. It is thus a mistake to rely on it—a broken clock is right for two moments a day, and wrong in all others. Your life has many important moments.</p>
<p>Because there is no consensus philosophy of science—no science of science—if you want to go into a more established field, you have to rely either on institutions, or your own evaluation of individual researchers. What you must do, then, is form your own judgments of the claims to intellectual authority made by particular institutions, or the quality of thinking of possibly exceptional individuals. But what if you want to go into a less established field?</p>
<h3>Communities of Practice</h3>
<p>For those considering entering a new field, there are several ways to acquire deep expertise. Firstly, there is the <a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/07-Brief-introduction-to-communities-of-practice.pdf">community of practice</a>—imagine a hobbyist society or hacktivist collective, for example. People gravitate towards these communities chiefly for friendship and community, and proceed to enthuse together over their community’s mechanism of practice, channeling this shared energy into competition for status, acceptance, and love. Thus, communities of practice tend to have a social pressure towards excellence. This often makes joining one one of the best ways to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>History is full of examples of communities of practice, from the circles of philosophers of Ancient Greece, to the guilds of medieval Europe, to Meetup.com. The Royal Society was originally a group of bored 17th century British aristocrats who wanted to stay far away from politics in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005KLSWDQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">aftermath of the English Civil war</a> to pursue knowledge of nature together. One can imagine them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities">showing off</a> their fanciful etchings and astronomical instruments, or one-upping each other with exotic mineral samples brought from far-flung corners of the globe. A side effect of this competition was science: we learned things about geology, astronomy, entomology, and so on. Thanks to this, Charles Darwin had access to a dataset describing the taxonomy and habitats of insects and plants from all over the world, which provided much of the evidence for his theories of natural selection. Were that prior work not done, Darwin’s theories would have been mere conjecture, difficult to establish as authoritative contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms of nature.</p>
<p>So seek out communities of practice; find out who is excited by what you want to learn. This community may or may not be very well-connected, but above all it should be relatively narrowly focused on the practice of some activity that its members constantly relate to. Without this focus, the community won’t have highly-trained internal heuristics—better heuristics than the age of buildings!—to identify who really knows what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Communities of practice are not perfect, but you can almost always rely on them in some way. Some of them may be fraudulent or confused, but you’re certainly better off joining one than attempting to be a pure individualist. There are likely entire communities out there centered on what you wish to study. Find them. Think about who would have the socioeconomic leisure to run such a community, and what they’d call themselves. Maybe you will find them at a university among college students, maybe on the internet. Perhaps you will find them among the modern equivalent of bored aristocrats—angel investors, perhaps. Smart, bored rich people will always find a hobby. It’s only a question of what that hobby is—is it what you’re searching for?</p>
<h3>Master-Apprentice Relationships</h3>
<p>Aside from communities of practice, another indispensable mechanism of transferring deep expertise is the master-apprentice relationship. In medieval European guilds, the master-apprentice relationship formed a strong contract. Instead of owing $90,000 of student debt and receiving a diploma, you instead would sign yourself up for service to a particular master for around seven or eight years. And at the end, they would essentially grant you their business. Their retirement plan would be <i>you</i>. Can you imagine how different your relationship with your doctoral advisor would be if you personally constituted their retirement plan? Their incentives would be much better aligned, to say the least.</p>
<p>A weaker, non-economic version of the<a href="https://youtu.be/ribdRDO75Rk"> master-apprentice relationship</a> does still apply for professors and thinkers who care about their legacy. And if a field has clearly identifiable experts, it is extremely valuable to work with the best person you can, in the hopes of forming a relationship with them. You should approach them and offer to proofread their papers, or even offer to make their coffee. Getting to work with them for a few hours a day …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Today’s guest on the EdTech Startup Show is Mike Teng.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Teng is the CEO and co-founder of Swing Education, a tech-enabled marketplace business that matches substitute teachers with schools in need. He was a software engineer in the private sector and then the tech director at a K-12 charter school network. He and two of his friends who are now co-founders saw the need for fill rates of substitute teachers in districts and decided to start Swing education.</p>



<p>Swing Education helps schools and districts find and schedule substitute teachers. They have also recently added tutoring with the same teachers in their classrooms. &nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>During this episode, Mike and I discuss:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>How Mike saw a problem with fill rates of substitute teachers with his co-founders who convinced him to leave his nonprofit work to start Swing Education.</li><li>He explains the challenges they went through getting their software out there and how they navigated the pricing model.&nbsp;</li><li>The cultural value in education organizations that makes decision making consensus-driven and leads to inefficiency when it comes to sales.&nbsp;</li><li>He explains how they are trying to capture and utilize the on-demand teachers workforce that exists.&nbsp;</li><li>How they convince school districts to buy into their program throughout the 50 states.</li><li>How tutoring has worked for them as an addition to their existing business in a highly competitive space.</li><li>How to implement investments correctly as a new founder by making the right decision.</li><li>How empathy learned in parenting translates to good leadership.</li><li>He explains how to eliminate time spent making phone calls without sacrificing good relationships in a business.</li><li>Mike encourages people to learn more about the Black Lives Matter social justice movement.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>When you encounter new information but have yet to form a belief about it, what’s the immediate response? Do you hold it up in your mental spotlight and subject it to a critical analysis? Do you suspend your belief until you’ve either confirmed or denied it?</p>



<p>We have <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/the-price-of-attention/">limited time and mental resources</a> to properly evaluate everything that impinges on our mind. We don’t stop to <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/trust-the-internet/">fact-check every headline</a> that passes us by on social media, or every claim made by certain news outlets, or each idea presented in a book.</p>



<p>What happens to those things that we encounter but don’t critically analyse? Research suggests that they can slip by into our truth baskets. Once there, they can persist rather stubbornly.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/the-ethics-of-belief/">Believing</a>, it turns out, is the easy part. The second step is where things get tricky.</p>



<h2>The Library of Belief</h2>



<p>Rene Descartes wrote, <em>“All that the intellect does is to enable me to perceive, without affirming or denying anything, the ideas which are subjects for possible judgments.”</em></p>



<p>To Descartes, the mind is supposed to hold ideas up to be examined, to keep them in limbo until a <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/betting-on-an-uncertain-future/">decision</a> about their accuracy is made.</p>



<p>Baruch Spinoza had a different idea. He thought that by perceiving or comprehending something we implicitly believe it first, and only through an extra step can we disconfirm it.</p>



<p>William James, writing of Spinoza’s position, said, <em>“All propositions, whether attributive or existential, are believed through the very fact of being conceived.”</em></p>



<p>In this account, if we don’t have the time or energy to critically consider the information impinging on our mind, we’re at risk of accepting it as true. Belief is the first step, evaluation the second.</p>



<p>Psychologist <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-17453-001">Dan Gilbert</a> uses a library metaphor to understand the two ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine you have a library, most of the books are nonfiction, but there are a few fiction in there too. To distinguish between them, you decide to tag the spines of the books, using one of two systems.</p>



<ul><li>In Descartes’ system, you place a red tag on the fiction books and a blue tag on the nonfiction.</li><li>In Spinoza’s system, you only place a red tag on the nonfiction.</li></ul>



<p>Both systems function effectively in that you can tell apart the nonfiction and fiction books. Spinoza’s system actually saves you time from not having to label every book.</p>



<p>However, what happens when new books arrive?</p>



<ul><li>In Descartes’ system, the new book doesn’t have a label, so even if you don’t read and label it right away, it will stand out amongst all the other labelled books.</li><li>In Spinoza’s system, the new book lacks a label, just like all your nonfiction books. If you don’t examine it then and there, it appears like a nonfiction book when you look for it later.</li></ul>



<p>When new books are being fed into the library, Spinoza’s system can break down.</p>



<p>Perhaps if you are already familiar with the book, you can label it true or false right away. But unfamiliar books need to be reviewed, and what if you don’t have the time to look through them all? What if new books are coming in too quickly for you to evaluate them one by one?</p>



<p>Then some fiction books will look like nonfiction books.</p>



<p>Does the mind sort through incoming information and ideas more like Descartes or Spinoza’s systems? Gilbert ran several studies that found Spinoza’s system to be more accurate.</p>



<h2>How To Make Someone Believe Something</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20(UNBELIEVING).pdf">1990 study</a>, Gilbert told participants statements such as <em>“A monishna is an armadillo,”</em> and followed that up by telling them if the statement was <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/gut-reaction/">true or false</a>.</p>



<p>On some trials, there was a tone immediately after hearing the validity of the statement, disrupting the participants thought processes. This disruption caused them to mislabel false statements as true, <strong>but not true statements as false</strong>.</p>



<p>If information remained neutral until we have confirmed or denied it, then we either shouldn’t make these mistakes and be able to recognise ideas that haven’t been tested; or mistakes should be made in both directions—false become true, and true become false. That didn’t happen.</p>



<p>In other <a href="http://www.danielgilbert.com/Gilbert%20et%20al%20(EVERYTHING%20YOU%20READ).pdf">studies</a>, he gave participants statements about a crime. The information was clearly labelled as reliable or false based on its colour, and so was identifiable at the same time as it was read. The information either exacerbated or lessened the extent of the crime.</p>



<p>On some trials, participants had a number task to do as they tried to read the information. The added mental <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/happiness-is-a-product-of-effort/">effort</a> caused false information to seep through as true, but didn’t cause the true information to be labelled false.</p>



<p>When asked to sentence the criminal, those who read the exacerbating false information gave sentences nearly twice as long as those who read the extenuating false information, even though they should both have been ignoring it.</p>



<p>Gilbert concludes:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“Findings from a multitude of research literatures converge on a single point: People are credulous creatures who find it very easy to believe and very difficult to doubt. In fact, believing is so easy, and perhaps so inevitable, that it may be more like involuntary comprehension than it is like rational assessment.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>New information is <strong>believed first, refuted second</strong>. But if something disrupts that refutation, whether by taxing our mental resources or some other reluctance on our part, false information can pass by unnoticed.</p>



<p>Consider reading a book, or scrolling through social media. You’re exposed to a lot of information, and it’s unreasonable to fact check every claim or critique every idea. It’s difficult to  know what of this information might leave its mark on your memory without going through the evaluation phase.</p>



<h2><strong>First Impressions Are Lasting Impressions</strong></h2>



<p>If we accept information as true until we find a reason to discredit it, we need to be good at recognising when it’s been discredited. It raises the value of humility and a slight scepticism of our own ideas.</p>



<p>Here, too, research often finds us wanting.</p>



<p>Initial pieces of information often form the base from which we branch out and evaluate others. First impressions guide us more in our interpretations of new evidence, than new evidence guides us in evaluating our old ideas.</p>



<p>In 1946, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1946-04654-001">Solomon Asch</a> played around with the order of lists. Take a look at these descriptions of Ben and Alan, and consider what you think of them:</p>



<ul><li>Ben: intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious</li><li>Alan: envious, stubborn, critical, impulsive, industrious, intelligent</li></ul>



<p>You probably noticed they’re the same descriptors, yet even so, Ben came off best. The first characterisations form the basis that the latter slightly adjust.</p>



<p>Many of our social interactions work this way. We meet someone who seems grumpy on a first encounter, and assume it’s a general disposition. Even if they seem pleasant on a second encounter, it doesn’t completely nullify that first impression.</p>



<p>Now consider someone with no opinion or knowledge of a hotly debated and complex issue. First, they see some statistics and hear a brief argument, and not having anything to compare it to or any obvious reason to reject it, they let it sink into their mind—believing is the default.</p>



<p>Might that initial impression influence how willing they are to accept other arguments or interpret different statistics? They might, of course, spend the time and exert the effort to properly evaluate different claims and reject their first hypothesis.</p>



<p>But believing is easy and first impressions endearing, validation requires time and energy and an openness to being wrong that I fear makes it the less common route.</p>



<h2>Finding Support for Your Beliefs</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> is now one of the more well-known topics in psychology. We<a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/finding-what-youre-looking-for/"> look for and readily accept</a> information that supports our ideas and beliefs.</p>



<p>Tom Gilovich <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ntl3dy">writes</a> that when we are evaluating agreeable positions, we ask ourselves <em>“<strong>can</strong> I believe this?”</em> However, when we are evaluating unagreeable positions we ask <em>“<strong>must</strong> I believe this?”</em></p>



<p>This makes us lenient towards acceptable ideas and critical of those we don’t align with. When approaching ideas you don’t agree with, you look around for any reason to invalidate it. When you find ideas you agree with, you look only for the minimal requirements.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“By framing the question in such ways … we can often believe what we prefer to believe, and satisfy ourselves that we have an objective basis for doing so.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Gilovich ran an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014616702236869">experiment</a> using different versions of the classic Wason task. In the original task, you are shown four cards, each has a number on one side and a colour on the opposite, as shown here:</p>



<figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Wason_selection_task_cards.svg/1200px-Wason_selection_task_cards.svg.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Wason_selection_task_cards.svg/1200px-Wason_selection_task_cards.svg.png"></figure>



<p>The task is to pick which cards you need to flip over to prove the rule that all even numbers have red on the other side.</p>



<p>Most people look only to <strong>confirm</strong> the rule, so they turn over the 8, because it must show red on the other side. However, the orange is also necessary—if it has an even number on the other side, it would <strong>prove the rule false</strong>.</p>



<p>Only about 20% answer both the 8 and the orange card. But by changing the options slightly Gilovich had it up around 52%.</p>



<p>Instead of using numbers and colours, Gilovich used negative stereotypes. When people belonged to the stereotypical group, they looked for the information that would prove the rule false, as that would save their image of themselves.</p>



<p>Because they didn’t want to believe the rule, they asked: <em>“must I believe this?”</em> They looked for any piece of evidence that might disconfirm it. When it’s just numbers and colours, people don’t have the same incentive, they simply ask <em>“can I believe this?”</em></p>



<p>There is some rationality to this. Why investigate what already makes sense to you? Why spend time and effort evaluating information that works cohesively with your existing knowledge? <strong>Why question something unless it raises a question?</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, given that believing is easy and initial opinions held onto in the face of discrepant information, questioning what we …</p></div></div>

<p>In machine learning we are often trying to get some algorithm or learning system to understand abstract attributes of a data distribution of interest. In our case, seismic data from a wide variety of geologic contexts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is often the case that labels for a given task are hard to come by. Take first break picking in seismic data: given a set of geophones laid out in a line which have recorded seismic data from a source of vibration, we would like to label the first-arrival of the seismic energy for each trace.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a typical noisy seismic image:</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/noisyseismic.png"> <em>We identify the first arrival for each seismic trace with a red dot <span></span></em></p>
<p>While we can train a neural network to estimate these arrivals when available, often no human-labeled first breaks are available, even if interesting raw seismic data is. In cases like these we still want our neural network to learn <em>something</em> from the data, even if the exact task-label is unavailable.</p>
<p>The data itself contains a wealth of geologic information which the neural network could likely extract to improve its internal representation of seismic data in general. We would like to find a way to train the neural network on the raw data without labels, and still have it learn meaningful features and representations which it could transfer to other downstream tasks like first break picking.</p>
<h2 id="autoencoders">Autoencoders</h2>
<p>This is the general idea behind autoencoders, a class of neural networks which attempt to estimate their own input, and in which the data is forced through a network with a <em>bottleneck layer</em> in the middle, such that the dimension of the bottleneck (usually denoted <span>\(\vec{z}\)</span>) is much lower than the dimension of the input data, <span>\(\vec{x}\)</span>: <span>\(\text{dim}(\vec{z}) \ll \text{dim}(\vec{x})\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/autoencoder.png"> <em>Autoencoder network diagram<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>In its simplest form, the loss function of a vanilla autoencoder measures how well the input data matches the reconstructed image: <span>\(L(\vec{x}) = (\vec{x} - \vec{x}')^2\)</span>. By forcing the data to flow through the bottleneck layer, we force the neural network to learn an efficient encoding of the data to some <em>latent space</em>, <span>\(\vec{z}\)</span>, and an efficient decoding from the latent space back to the initial distribution. We call the portions of the network before and after the compact latent space the encoder and decoder, respectively.</p>
<p>By training an autoencoder on all of our data, even where labels are unavailable, we hope that the network learns powerful internal representations, which we can then transfer to another network trained for a particular final task. This kind of pre-training and transfer is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer Learning</a>.</p>
<h2 id="latent-space">Latent Space</h2>
<p>Before diving in to how we’ll take advantage of transfer learning to help solve our first-break picking task, it’s interesting to discuss the concept of the latent space introduced with autoencoders.</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/vibrating.gif"> <em>Vibrating strings<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></em></p>
<p>Latent means “hidden”: in machine learning a latent space refers to a space in which dimensions represent abstract features, rather than encoding literal spatial properties. In physics, for example, one can model an arbitrary vibrating string state as a point in Hilbert Space where each dimension corresponds to an overtone of the string - Hilbert Space can be considered as a kind of latent space.</p>
<p>If we imagine training an autoencoder on images of cars perhaps its latent space would come to represent different manufacturers, so that dimension one is Honda, and dimension two is Ford, and so on. Then the decoder takes the latent space representation and produces the image which was most likely to be encoded into that latent description.</p>
<p>In a typical convolutional neural net for image classification, we can think of the final convolutional layer as the latent space - a space of learned features that are relevant to classifying our image, with the final fully connected layer approximating a <em>decision boundary in the latent space</em> for classification.</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/cnnclassification.png"> <em>Typical CNN classifier network diagram<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></em></p>
<h2 id="gans">GANs</h2>
<p>Generative Adversarial Networks<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, or GANs, are a kind of generative algorithm that learns to generate samples from a data distribution in a unique way. There is a Generator, <span>\(G\)</span>, and a Discriminator, <span>\(D\)</span>, each of which are usually implemented as a neural network. The Generator’s goal is to produce realistic seeming samples of the underlying distribution (this could be handwritten digits, human faces, anything…) and the Discriminator’s goal is to learn to distinguish real samples from samples generated by the Generator. By pitting the two against each other in a game, their competition drives the Generator to produce realistic samples to fool the Discriminator.</p>
<p>Formally, let <span>\(G(\vec{z})\)</span> be a sample produced by the Generator (later we will address what <span>\(\vec{z}\)</span>, <span>\(G\)</span>’s input is), and let <span>\(D(\vec{x})\)</span> be the Discriminator’s opinion about the probability that its input is a real sample, so that <span>\(D \in [0,1]\)</span>. We want <span>\(G(\vec{z}) \sim \vec{x}\)</span>. Let <span>\(E_{p(\vec{x})}\)</span> represent an expectation over a distribution <span>\(p(\vec{x})\)</span>, then the GAN loss function is:</p>
<p><span>\[
\underset{G}{\text{min}} \, \underset{D}{\text{max}} \left( E_{p(\vec{x})} \left [ \log(D(\vec{x}))\right] + E_{p(\vec{z})} \left[ \log(1-D(G(z)))\right] \right )
\]</span></p>
<p>Unpacking this, notice that <span>\(D\)</span> is trying to <em>maximize</em> the probability of true samples, while <span>\(G\)</span> is trying to <em>minimize</em> <span>\(\log(1-D(G(\vec{z})))\)</span>, which amounts to maximizing <span>\(D\)</span>’s classification error. The loss function actually encodes a zero-sum minimax game!</p>
<p>Note also that we did not specify what the input to <span>\(G\)</span> is. We feed it Gaussian noise, and as if it were the decoder in an autoencoder, we can think of its input as noise in a latent space. By carefully training <span>\(G\)</span> and <span>\(D\)</span> in turn, <span>\(G\)</span> eventually learns to produce quite realistic-seeming samples from the true distribution of data, receiving only noise as input.</p>
<p>Since the whole network is a differentiable (and therefore continuous) function with respect to its input, which we interpret as a latent space, we can take continuous walks through the latent space and watch as the generator produces continuously varying images which seem to semantically interpolate through abstract features. A popular GAN training set is human faces, so that a walk through latent space produces these unsettling GIFs:</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/nvidiafacegan.gif"> <em>Continuous walk through latent space in Nvidia’s GAN<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></em></p>
<h2 id="seismic-gan">Seismic GAN</h2>
<p>As a powerful general-purpose generative model, we can train a GAN on all kinds of seismic data without the need to worry about task-specific labels!</p>
<p>Training GANs, however, is notoriously tricky. Everyone’s experience seems somewhat different, but a <a href="https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks">whole slew</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.11096.pdf#page=23">tricks</a> are known to help stabilize GAN convergence. Personally, I found Spectral Normalization<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and avoiding sigmoid activation in the output layer due to clipping<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (do BCE directly on the logits) to be the most beneficial hacks, but YMMV.</p>
<p>Finally with our trained generator and discriminator, we can transfer their learned weights to other networks for downstream task finetuning! But before that, let’s take a look at some generated samples by walking through latent space à la the face GANs. We get some beautiful generated “dreams” of seismic data:</p>

<p>Apple’s strategy for years has been to <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/10/23/iwork-13-a-huge-regression/">trade desktop power for cross-device feature parity</a>. As expected, <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/">macOS Big Sur</a> continues this trend, emphasizing a consistent user interface across devices, and focusing on cross-device development technologies like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Catalyst</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I wish Apple had different priorities. I’d like to see more apps like <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, an industry-leading creative app that’s built top to bottom on Apple technologies. But Sketch was released in 2010, and Apple hasn’t created any new frameworks like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics">Core Graphics</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage">Core Image</a> that support these kinds of apps in over a decade. So I wasn’t holding my breath for them to announce anything new for these kinds of apps at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC</a> this year.</p>

<p>Since Apple isn’t prioritizing powerful desktop apps with their own technologies, that means supporting these use cases mostly falls on third parties. This is where companies like <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/?promoid=29NMCNT6&amp;mv=other">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.avid.com/">Avid</a>, <a href="https://www.maxonlift.com/">Maxon</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> come in. While Apple’s priorities regarding their own technologies have been clear for awhile now, what hasn’t been clear is their priorities for third-party apps, in particular, ones that aren’t sandboxed. The trend for the last few years has been making it harder to develop these kinds of apps for macOS. <a href="https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/new-apple-event-apis-in-macos-mojave">AEpocalypse</a> (2018), <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/23/annoying-catalina-security-features/">Catalina’s security features</a> (2019), and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution">Notarization</a> (2018) are all examples of this trend.</p>

<p>The overarching reason behind the changes that make developing these kinds of apps harder is “Security”. And unlike cross-device feature parity, it’s unclear exactly where this all ends. Because after all, the most secure system there is is the one that doesn’t run any software at all. That’s why it’s such a pleasant surprise, that, as far as I can tell, Apple has done everything they can to make Big Sur, and the accompanying transition to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, as seamless as possible, even for apps that aren’t sandboxed.</p>

<p>Some were predicting that Macs on Apple Silicon wouldn’t even run apps from outside of the Mac App Store, that didn’t happen. It <a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2020/6/educated_guesses_about_a_mac_transition_to_arm.html">seemed more likely</a> that Apple would drop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL">OpenCL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>, but those are <a href="https://twitter.com/colincornaby/status/1275153748348682240">sticking along for the ride</a>. No details were known about whether there would be an emulation layer, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28software%29">original Rosetta</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple's_transition_to_Intel_processors">2006 Intel transition</a>, Apple appears to have gone above in beyond with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>, which supports plug-ins like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology">VSTis</a>, giving lots of options for migration paths for powerful modular software.</p>

<p>I’m still frustrated that there probably won’t be another Sketch for the foreseeable future, but that ship sailed a long time ago. And no other platform has a Sketch either, an industry defining app that’s a platform exclusive, so while Apple has lost a unique advantage that only they had, they haven’t lost anything that other platforms already have. Other platforms can run powerful modular software that’s distributed outside the Mac App Store, but today, so can new Macs running Big Sur. Here’s to hoping that the dust has settled, and the last of the restrictions on third-party apps are behind us now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Anyone who has written more than a hello world program should have used a debugger at some point (if you haven’t, drop what you’re doing and learn how to use one). However, although these tools are in such widespread use, there aren’t a lot of resources which tell you how they work and how to write one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, especially when compared to other toolchain technologies like compilers. In this post series we’ll learn what makes debuggers tick and write one for debugging Linux programs.</p>
<p>We’ll support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch, halt, and continue execution</li>
<li>Set breakpoints on
<ul>
<li>Memory addresses</li>
<li>Source code lines</li>
<li>Function entry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read and write registers and memory</li>
<li>Single stepping
<ul>
<li>Instruction</li>
<li>Step in</li>
<li>Step out</li>
<li>Step over</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print current source location</li>
<li>Print backtrace</li>
<li>Print values of simple variables</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final part I’ll also outline how you could add the following to your debugger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote debugging</li>
<li>Shared library and dynamic loading support</li>
<li>Expression evaluation</li>
<li>Multi-threaded debugging support</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be focusing on C and C++ for this project, but it should work just as well with any language which compiles down to machine code and outputs standard DWARF debug information (if you don’t know what that is yet, don’t worry, this will be covered soon). Additionally, my focus will be on just getting something up and running which works most of the time, so things like robust error handling will be eschewed in favour of simplicity.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="getting-set-up">Getting set up</h3>
<p>Before we jump into things, let’s get our environment set up. I’ll be using two dependencies in this tutorial: <a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise">Linenoise</a> for handling our command line input, and <a href="https://github.com/TartanLlama/libelfin/tree/fbreg">libelfin</a> for parsing the debug information. You could use the more traditional libdwarf instead of libelfin, but the interface is nowhere near as nice, and libelfin also provides a mostly complete DWARF expression evaluator, which will save you a lot of time if you want to read variables. Make sure that you use the fbreg branch of my fork of libelfin, as it hacks on some extra support for reading variables on x86.</p>
<p>Once you’ve either installed these on your system, or got them building as dependencies with whatever build system you prefer, it’s time to get started. I just set them to build along with the rest of my code in my CMake files.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="launching-the-executable">Launching the executable</h3>
<p>Before we actually debug anything, we’ll need to launch the debugee program. We’ll do this with the classic fork/exec pattern.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>argv</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>argc</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cerr</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Program name not specified"</span><span>;</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>prog</span> <span>=</span> <span>argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>pid</span> <span>=</span> <span>fork</span><span>();</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>//we're in the child process
</span>        <span>//execute debugee
</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span>
        <span>//we're in the parent process
</span>        <span>//execute debugger
</span>    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We call <code>fork</code> and this causes our program to split into two processes. If we are in the child process, <code>fork</code> returns <code>0</code>, and if we are in the parent process, it returns the process ID of the child process.</p>
<p>If we’re in the child process, we want to replace whatever we’re currently executing with the program we want to debug.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp">   <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>PTRACE_TRACEME</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span>
   <span>execl</span><span>(</span><span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Here we have our first encounter with <code>ptrace</code>, which is going to become our best friend when writing our debugger. <code>ptrace</code> allows us to observe and control the execution of another process by reading registers, reading memory, single stepping and more. The API is very ugly; it’s a single function which you provide with an enumerator value for what you want to do, and then some arguments which will either be used or ignored depending on which value you supply. The signature looks like this:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>long</span> <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span> <span>__ptrace_request</span> <span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>pid_t</span> <span>pid</span><span>,</span>
            <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>data</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><code>request</code> is what we would like to do to the traced process; <code>pid</code> is the process ID of the traced process; <code>addr</code> is a memory address, which is used in some calls to designate an address in the tracee; and <code>data</code> is some request-specific resource. The return value often gives error information, so you probably want to check that in your real code; I’m just omitting it for brevity. You can have a look at the man pages for more information.</p>
<p>The request we send in the above code, <code>PTRACE_TRACEME</code>, indicates that this process should allow its parent to trace it. All of the other arguments are ignored, because API design isn’t important /s.</p>
<p>Next, we call <code>execl</code>, which is one of the many <code>exec</code> flavours. We execute the given program, passing the name of it as a command-line argument and a <code>nullptr</code> to terminate the list. You can pass any other arguments needed to execute your program here if you like.</p>
<p>After we’ve done this, we’re finished with the child process; we’ll just let it keep running until we’re finished with it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="adding-our-debugger-loop">Adding our debugger loop</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve launched the child process, we want to be able to interact with it. For this, we’ll create a <code>debugger</code> class, give it a loop for listening to user input, and launch that from our parent fork of our <code>main</code> function.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span>
    <span>//parent
</span>    <span>debugger</span> <span>dbg</span><span>{</span><span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>};</span>
    <span>dbg</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>class</span> <span>debugger</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>debugger</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>prog_name</span><span>,</span> <span>pid_t</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>m_prog_name</span><span>{</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>move</span><span>(</span><span>prog_name</span><span>)},</span> <span>m_pid</span><span>{</span><span>pid</span><span>}</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>();</span>

<span>private</span><span>:</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>m_prog_name</span><span>;</span>
    <span>pid_t</span> <span>m_pid</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>In our <code>run</code> function, we need to wait until the child process has finished launching, then just keep on getting input from linenoise until we get an EOF (ctrl+d).</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>wait_status</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>waitpid</span><span>(</span><span>m_pid</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>wait_status</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>);</span>

    <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span><span>((</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>linenoise</span><span>(</span><span>"minidbg&gt; "</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>handle_command</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
        <span>linenoiseHistoryAdd</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
        <span>linenoiseFree</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>When the traced process is launched, it will be sent a <code>SIGTRAP</code> signal, which is a trace or breakpoint trap. We can wait until this signal is sent using the <code>waitpid</code> function.</p>
<p>After we know the process is ready to be debugged, we listen for user input. The <code>linenoise</code> function takes a prompt to display and handles user input by itself. This means we get a nice command line with history and navigation commands without doing much work at all. When we get the input, we give the command to a <code>handle_command</code> function which we’ll write shortly, then we add this command to the linenoise history and free the resource.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="handling-input">Handling input</h3>
<p>Our commands will follow a similar format to gdb and lldb. To continue the program, a user will type <code>continue</code> or <code>cont</code> or even just <code>c</code>. If they want to set a breakpoint on an address, they’ll write <code>break 0xDEADBEEF</code>, where <code>0xDEADBEEF</code> is the desired address in hexadecimal format. Let’s add support for these commands.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>handle_command</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>,</span><span>' '</span><span>);</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>command</span> <span>=</span> <span>args</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>is_prefix</span><span>(</span><span>command</span><span>,</span> <span>"continue"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>continue_execution</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cerr</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Unknown command</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><code>split</code> and <code>is_prefix</code> are a couple of small helper functions:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>split</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>delimiter</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>out</span><span>.</span><span>push_back</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>out</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We’ll add <code>continue_execution</code> to the <code>debugger</code> class.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>continue_execution</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>PTRACE_CONT</span><span>,</span> <span>m_pid</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>wait_status</span><span>;</span>

    <span>waitpid</span><span>(</span><span>m_pid</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>wait_status</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>For now our <code>continue_execution</code> function will just use <code>ptrace</code> to tell the process to continue, then <code>waitpid</code> until it’s signalled.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>
<p>Now you should be able to compile some C or C++ program, run it through your debugger, see it halting on entry, and be able to continue execution from your debugger. In the next part we’ll learn how to get our debugger to set breakpoints. If you come across any issues, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>What you notice on social media is that people copy each other a lot. We do this in all aspects of life, but within the constraints of social media, it is especially noticeable. Most social media gives you a format to do what you want with. We naturally copy each other.</p>



<p>Social networks want you to create content and stay on the platform. You want social networks to entertain you and raise your status. These incentives are connected. The more content you create, the more likely you create entertaining content. The more entertaining content you create (or watch), the more likely you will stick around. TikTok has succeeded here. They designed a platform that creates massive amounts of entertaining content. How have they done it?</p>



<p>Unlike other platforms, the entire content creation process happens within TikTok. More importantly, they have built copying into the platform itself. By combining these two features, TikTok created a dominant position in mobile video.</p>



<h3>Making it Easy to Create Content</h3>



<blockquote><p>If you want to build a new user-generated content platform or social network then the content has to be <em>extremely</em> light. The content creation AND consumption need to happen within seconds, not minutes.</p><cite>Alex Zhu (Former Head of TikTok)</cite></blockquote>



<p>It must be easy to create content for it to be easy to copy content.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="203" data-permalink="https://ianvanagas.com/screenshot_20200618-143004/" data-orig-file="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png" data-orig-size="1100,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot_20200618-143004" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=161" data-large-file="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=550" src="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=550" alt="" width="319" height="593" srcset="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=550 550w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=319 319w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=638 638w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=81 81w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=161 161w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px"><figcaption>All the tools needed to create content are within the camera.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Video has long been a medium with two sides of production. On one side, you have unedited video for social media such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. On the other, you have edited and produced as you see on YouTube and Twitch.</p>



<p>TikTok found a middle ground. It allows users to create lightly edited videos within the app. Much of the “editing” happens in reshooting. Videos are short enough that they can be reshot until it is right. Other features like timers, trimming, and effects (like green screen) are all built-in as well.</p>



<p>You don’t need anything except your phone to make content. No computer, no editing software, no fancy camera gear. Most content is shot with the front-facing camera.</p>



<p>Anyone can create content on TikTok without much effort. What you do or say is much more valuable than what your video looks like. The level of entertainment in your video isn’t driven by the quality of your editing or gear, it is driven by the quality of your content.</p>



<p>The built-in features make content creation easy, leading to large amounts of content being created, but content also has to be entertaining. Here is where TikTok innovates: they build copying into the platform itself. </p>



<h3>Building Copying into the Creation Process</h3>



<p>Creating entertaining content is hard. When you can film anything, what is entertaining? TikTok solves this by giving users templates to create entertaining content through the memes, trends, and sound on their platform.</p>

<p>Video is a powerful medium because it is information-dense. You can copy a dance or meme just by watching it. It is obvious that shorter videos are easier to copy, there are fewer variables. When on TikTok, you see memes repeated and understand the format. Future memes in that format will gain from your familiarity.</p>



<p>The creation process is tied to the viewing process. When you watch something entertaining and think “I have an idea,” it is two clicks to start filming your idea. No platform makes it easier.</p>



<p>One of the largest drivers of building familiarity is music and audio tracks. The audio provides a repeatable format for content. Similar to how memes on Reddit or Instagram use visual formats, TikTok uses audio. <strong>The difference is that Instagram and Reddit do not make making memes easy. </strong>You have to know the format, find a site to create the meme (or Photoshop it) then come back to the site and upload. When you click a sound on TikTok it shows all the videos created with that sound and provides a big button promoting creation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Musical.ly (the predecessor to TikTok) uses music as a raw material. Music is not the end product. It’s a raw material. In contrast, the end product on Spotify, Pandora, etc. is music. </p><cite>Alex Zhu</cite></blockquote>



<p>The most popular sounds have tens of thousands of videos. TikTok has made music the template. It turns out it is a very good one. We get music stuck in our head all the time, how often does a meme or image get stuck in your head? Not very often. TikTok songs have dominated the top music charts for the last 2 years (and you may have not even realized that).</p>



<p>TikTok adjusts its algorithm for you based on what you enjoy. Videos in familiar formats will show up over and over. This is possible because popular formats have lots of content in each. The combination of easy creation and copied formats leads to large amounts of personally entertaining content for you.</p>



<h3>Culture of Copying</h3>



<p>Copying people on other platforms is often looked down upon. You lose status if you copy too much. On TikTok, it is promoted, everyone does it. It is a natural assumption that you copy everyone and everyone copies you.</p>

<p>Other platforms focus on following people or accounts. TikTok focuses much more on trends and memes. If you like a video with a certain trend, you will likely see more videos from that trend in the future. Everyone’s TikTok experience consists of different videos grouped into trends and memes. That is only possible because copying creates lots of content in each trend.</p>



<p>Other platforms have accepted the idea of sharing. When you want to share someone else’s tweet, you retweet it. When you want to share someone else’s Facebook post, you share it. TikTok doesn’t allow this, which is intentional. Content on TikTok can be shared, but new content must be added on top to do it.</p>



<p>For example, TikTok has a feature called a duet which allows users to show their video next to a video already posted. Another feature allows creators to reply to comments as a standalone TikTok. You even see TikToks on top of other TikToks using the green screen feature.</p>



<p>Every feature on TikTok drives towards making more content, this turns users from passive consumers to active creators. Everyone copies, so you should too. Users that create content are always more valuable than users that only consume. TikTok does a better job at this than any other platform.</p>



<h3>The Future of TikTok and Copying Content</h3>



<p>TikTok focuses on creation rather than engagement. Other platforms assume experts and professionals create the best content. TikTok assumes that entertaining content can come from anywhere.</p>



<p>If content can come from anywhere, then everyone must have the ability to create. Expect to see platforms controlling more of the creation process and making it easier for everyone to create content. Stories is an example of this. Posts are polished, stories less so; therefore, people will post more stories.</p>



<p>TikTok makes it okay to hop on the bandwagon. They built a platform that acknowledges that new content is built from old content. Users want to copy each other, so let them. Anyone can be successful on TikTok by copying the people around them.</p>



<p>The structure of other platforms makes it difficult for them to compete. They depend on the idea that content deserves to be reshared rather than copied. Resharing isn’t copying, it isn’t creating something new. It is boosting someone else’s work. TikTok forces users to create new content whenever they want to interact with other content (trends, duets, comment replies).</p>



<p>TikTok has aligned incentives. It creates a massive amount of entertaining content in a way that no existing platform can copy. I expect it to have a dominant position in social media for many years to come.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/question-productivity-coronavirus/">COVID-19 crisis</a> has created many concerns that had to be addressed immediately; from employee health to supply chain shortages, many companies began this pandemic in a scramble.</p><p>When the dust settles, our companies may look different: businesses have fewer staff doing different kinds of product delivery in order to maintain social distancing, for instance. Companies delivering services have transitioned to working from home, and businesses are adjusting their expectations due to many increased caregiving duties for parents in their employ.</p><p>What all of this boils down to is the fact that, even when business is ramping back up in many places, there may be persistent issues of low productivity, at least compared to pre-pandemic levels of production. This in itself may feel like a cause for alarm, but recognizing the sources of low productivity during and after a crisis can be key to understanding and responding to this change.</p><h2 id="factors-causing-low-productivity">Factors Causing Low Productivity</h2><p>While no crisis is identical, there are a few different ways that productivity can be affected during this time. To focus, let's look specifically at how low productivity applies to your employees, since there are at least three different sources of low productivity, each of which requires a different response.</p><p>Many companies rely on a variety of vendors, suppliers, and outsourcing along the process for creating their goods and services. During this time, lack of productivity in any of your vendors and outsourcing creates bottlenecks for your employees. The factors you need to address on this front include creating clear communication with your employees; if they can't get the external roadblocks out of their way, they'll feel discouraged. As a company owner or upper management, it's in your best interest to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22317168">identify these issues early</a> and work toward resolution. At the same time, set reasonable expectations with your team, since you don't want them to feel low morale over reduced productivity when they cannot change that circumstance.</p><h3 id="external-personal-life-factors">External, Personal-Life Factors</h3><p>Right now, as in other crises, many employees are splitting their time between childcare at home and working from home. This may create challenges for typical productivity, especially if your schedule is rigid to the M-F, 9-5 workday. Realistically, two-income households or single parents are going to have to care for their children during that time, and they may alternate as best they can to both do their jobs and care for their child or children.</p><p>Issues of this sort arise even when there is no crisis, such as when a child goes through a major illness that necessitates time away from work. When possible, addressing external personal-life factors in productivity should be done with compassion and empathy. A collaborative solution with someone who is usually a high performer tends to win you loyalty as an employer, so consider carefully how you address this kind of low productivity.</p><h3 id="internal-morale-driven-factors">Internal Morale-Driven Factors</h3><p>Another concerning element of low productivity comes from the upheaval of a crisis and its effect on the mental health of a worker. Being unusually distractable, fearful, or without focus is natural during a crisis, but it is a frustrating outcome when there are no other external factors preventing productivity. For typically-productive employees, this is another source of low productivity worth approaching with a spirit of experimentation. Helping your team find what will help them manage their anxieties through an Employee Assistance Program or other resource can be helpful, as can offering the option for a lower-hour workweek during this time or moving forward.</p><h2 id="addressing-low-productivity-in-a-nuanced-professional-way">Addressing Low Productivity in a Nuanced, Professional Way</h2><p>Each of these sources of low productivity merits a different response, but none of them are quite the typical "low performer" approach that you might take during business as usual. Instead, see if there is something to learn from the situation and a way to salvage the relationship with the employee. Human resources are very valuable, and returning to high productivity is possible in many cases.</p><h3 id="collaboratively-set-goals-and-make-changes">Collaboratively Set Goals and Make Changes</h3><p>When external factors are a major source of low productivity, working with your employees to create plans of action can be very empowering. Use these meetings to discuss what steps you'll put in place to overcome external supply chain issues, for instance, or what workplace flexibility will help them balance childcare with work. Making this collaborative instead of top-down helps each solution actually fit the issue that's occurring. It also builds trust and rapport.</p><h3 id="discuss-timelines-for-removing-barriers-to-productivity">Discuss Timelines for Removing Barriers to Productivity</h3><p>With internal or personal-life-related barriers to productivity, a gentle conversation about when these barriers can be removed and steps to take can be helpful. Your employees may need time to find childcare, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339264/">work with a therapist</a> to address causes of anxiety, or to shift their schedule such that they can take advantage of their best mental acuity. By letting them help you set the timeline for when they will have these things in place, even in a time of uncertainty, it gives you natural check-in points where you can address any persistent issues and reformulate a new plan if needed.</p><h3 id="offer-new-workplace-flexibility-in-order-to-work-toward-better-productivity">Offer New Workplace Flexibility In Order to Work Toward Better Productivity</h3><p>One of the paths to handling all forms of low productivity is to rethink rigid scheduling. Many employees may find that their home life works more smoothly with a schedule that is skewed toward late nights, weekends, or staggered work in two-hour bursts. This is a time when making these concessions may be not only a good idea, but necessary to improve productivity. If, for instance, a two-income household can stagger their work time so as to have an adult "off work" to care for their children at all times, the quality of both people's work will go up.</p><p>You also may find that switching from traditional jobs to 30 hour a week positions grants flexibility and allows your employees to work less, giving them more time to exercise, cook, care for others, and generally feel balanced. Lower stress ends up making their 30 hours very productive, leading to a per-hour productivity increase for you and your business.</p>

                    <p>Many people ask what's a Pull Request. Being straightforward, a Pull Request is the name of a GitHub feature that aims to easy the&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">code review</a>&nbsp;process by improving its experience. Before this feature, software engineers and developers used to send patches of code by email. Patches are files containing code changes (both removed and added code) condensed in a format that developers can apply them on a codebase.</p>
                    <p>Linux development used to share patch files via email. As new tools came out, the process of development modernized itself. Some tools call it Merge Request, or Change Request. In practice, the same thing: an evolution of email threads with patches attached to it. And Linux now uses Pull Requests to develop the operational system.</p>
                    <p>The Pull Request feature is hugely influenced by open-source philosophy. That’s why it is used by modern companies to promote collaboration and a sense of community among peers.</p>

                    <h2>Roles involved in a Pull Request</h2>
                    <p>As it is a kind of peer review, the primary people involved in a Pull Request are Software Engineers or Developers. However, other roles can benefit from practice.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/5-responsibilities-of-a-tech-lead-and-17-metrics-to-track-their-performance">Tech Leads</a>&nbsp;should review pull requests in a less intrusive or blocking approach. By overseeing the team’s work, tech leads can understand technical deficits, or spot technical misguidance. It’s their work to keep an eye on the produced code and make sure it meets conventions and standards.</p>
                    <p>Team Leads can look at the comments for engagement and lack of specific knowledge. Besides, comments reveal how people communicate. A&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-to-improve-your-communication-skills-on-code-review-in-8-bullets">non-violent language</a>&nbsp;and a mentoring mindset (the one that stands for questioning and teaching instead of pointing fingers) can reflect in a more harmonious work environment.</p>
                    <p>As the hierarchy counts, sometimes engineers tend to avoid discussions or even feel uncomfortable when leaders actively take part in the review process. That’s why Engineering Managers or CTOs are not encouraged to participate, although overseeing can bring lots of benefits, including the mitigation of risks.</p>
                    <p>Non-technical roles are welcomed in the pull requests as well. UI or UX Designers, for instance, play an essential part in reducing the feedback cycle. As they can see screenshots, run the code (even test some variations if they code) in their machine, they can aggregate a lot of the process.</p>

                    <h2>Pull Request best practices</h2>
                    <p>The Pull Request itself has lots of best practices. They aren’t restricted to the tool, like GitHub or GitLab, but they extend to the individual, team, and technology. Plus, they can happen before, during, or after the creation of a pull request.</p>
                    <p>The best practices that come before opening a pull request intend to lessen the communication noise, making it more straightforward to review and accelerate the feedback loop. In this category,&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-and-why-your-team-should-use-it">linters</a>&nbsp;are one of the most known and recommended.</p>
                    <p>They can analyze static code, and look for optimization, code smells, security issues, and many other checks. Depending on the language or framework, there may be a linter for specific tests. Here a brief list of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sourcelevel.io/engines/">some existing engines</a>.</p>
                    <p>Softwares used during the development process can have their best practices too. It’s the case of&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/7-git-best-practices-to-start-using-in-your-next-commit">git</a>.</p>
                    <p>During the review process, it’s crucial to establish a&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-to-improve-your-communication-skills-on-code-review-in-8-bullets">non-violent communication</a>, as it promotes a healthy place for collaboration of all peers.</p>

                            <p>A Pull Request Checklist is never complete. The following topics are an excellent start for those that had nothing. However, it’s crucial for your team to adapt accordingly to its needs.</p>
                            <p>It’s recommended to review the items periodically, so the team can remove deprecated ones, and polish those that remain in the list.</p>
                            <p>This document organizes the checklist in three categories to better understand when to perform each action.</p>
                            <p>Following this checklist seems unpractical for the long run since every reviewer should adopt it for each pull request examined. It’s excellent for beginners, though, that are not confident or aware of what to look for in code reviews.</p>

                    <h3>Before opening the Pull Request</h3>
                    <p>Software Engineers and Developers should perform the items listed below every time they open a new pull request. The checklist aims to reduce the noise among the author and their reviewers. Besides, it also increases the overall quality of the codebase and avoids new bugs.</p>
                    <p>For more details on the items, you can read more about[[what to check before assigning a Pull Request]](/blog/10-items-to-check-before-assigning-a-pull-request-to-someone-plus-a-bonus).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☑️ Name the branch accordingly to the team’s convention</li>
                        <li>☑️ Explicit whether the Pull Request is a draft (or WIP)</li>
                        <li>☑️ Go through the changed code looking for typos, TODOs, commented LOCs, debugging pieces of code, trailing whitespaces, etc.</li>
                        <li>☑️ Make sure objects, structures, and variables have semantic names</li>
                        <li>☑️ Run the proper linters, and fix the pointed issues that make sense</li>
                        <li>☑️ Squad, edit or reorder the commits to make it look like a story (or a task list)</li>
                        <li>☑️ Cherry-pick non-related commits to a specific branch</li>
                        <li>☑️ Optimize SQL queries to fetch only relevant table columns, avoiding n+1, or fetching unused relations</li>
                        <li>☑️ Rebase your branch onto master and upstream branch</li>
                        <li>☑️ Enrich the description with detailed descriptions, explaining the motivation, and the solution. Add media like screenshots, gifs, or even small videos. Tag it following the team’s convention.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, right after opening the pull request, comment inline any interesting fact or piece of code that you feed the urge to share. For example, you may point out a new API method that got you impressed with or a programming language feature that you’ve just learned.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Reviewing a Pull Request</h3>
                    <p>Take time to review a pull request properly. Reviewing code is not just about pointing fingers. It’s also an opportunity to learn from others.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☑️ Does the code work? Check whether function and logic are correct.</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are functions, methods, and variables adequately named?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are names semantic and meaningful for your business?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is it well tested?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are there unit tests, and they have good quality? Do they test the functionality?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Do tests reach acceptable coverage for your project?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is the code clear and easy to understand?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Does it meet the team’s guidelines and style guides?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is there any duplicated code?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is there any commented or unnecessary code?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Does the code take the most out of frameworks and language? Is there any custom implementation of native or already-existing functions?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are there code smells, grey areas, or bug-prone?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is documentation on functions, methods, classes, contexts, and behaviors adequate?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is the code as modular as possible?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are the critical spots adequately logged?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Does the code consider failures? Is it just considering the happy path?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are there better or simpler solutions?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is there any performance issue?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are input data sanitized?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is there any SQL Injection point?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is sensitive information being encoded or encrypted?</li>

                    <p>Pull Request benefits from collaboration. So, it’s crucial to detail the change to the team. With a better idea of the business and development contexts, they can understand and better review your code.</p>
                    <p>If it’s a work in progress, make sure to make it explicit. You can use checkboxes or bullet lists to display the tasks that need to be done. Then, follow the following guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☑️ Reply to the given feedback with your thoughts on the pointed issue. It can be an emoji or a single sentence.</li>
                        <li>☑️ Use and abuse some pull request features, like sharing specific code lines, diffs, and links to make your point</li>
                        <li>☑️ When commenting, link the “commit sha” to illustrate how and where is the related change.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Pull Request Metrics</h2>
                    <p>Pull Request metrics are actionable indicators used for managing software engineering teams. They differ from Agile Metrics as they don’t reflect the whole process, but fundamental elements of software development. That’s why they’re called <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/measuring-engineering-teams-actionable-metrics-for-managers">Software Engineering Metrics</a>.</p>
                    <p>Lead Time also called Cycle Time, although <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/why-you-should-use-lead-time-instead-of-cycle-time">they’re not the same thing</a>, is the most known engineering metric. Agile coaches and Scrum Masters usually measure User Stories Lead Time (the time a card took to go from “Backlog” to “Done”).</p>
                    <p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/becoming-a-manager-of-engineers-focusing-on-visibility-and-predictability">Engineering Managers</a> have been using Lead Time to understand how much time engineers spend on code review.

Relay executes workflows, which consist of multiple related steps, to perform actions like opening Jira tickets, merging pull requests, or even deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="76a9">Relay is built on containerization and leverages <a href="https://tekton.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tekton</a> to execute workflows. Each step in a Relay workflow runs an <a href="https://opencontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCI</a>-compatible container image. Unlike conventional workflow automation tools, this gives you the ability to make your own completely custom steps; you’re not restricted to our curated steps or even to a particular programming language.</p><p id="d57a">When we set out to implement triggers to automatically run workflows from event data, we wanted to make sure you’d have similar flexibility as within a workflow to receive external data. We decided to provide three initial options: schedule triggers, which run your workflows on a specified interval; push triggers, which allow your services to directly send data to Relay; and webhook triggers, which integrate with lots of external services that can push event data to arbitrary HTTP endpoints.</p><p id="525d">Webhook triggers presented the biggest technical challenge to implement, as every service provides slightly different payloads representing their events. Keeping with our container-based approach, we let you define webhook triggers by running your own web server in a container you provide to us. In this post, we’ll walk through how we implemented our webhook trigger handling using <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/serving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knative Serving</a> and the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/install/install-ambassador-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador API Gateway</a>.</p><p id="3b33">You can see <a href="https://github.com/relay-integrations/relay-pagerduty/blob/master/triggers/pagerduty-trigger-incident-triggered/handler.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example of a complete webhook trigger implementation</a> in our PagerDuty integration.</p><p id="c33e">We chose Knative Serving as a reverse proxy for webhook triggers. We could have configured a Kubernetes deployment for each webhook trigger, but we felt the resource burden on our cluster would be too high to have every customer pod running all the time.</p><p id="83a2">Knative Serving’s unique model uses an activator and autoscaler to dynamically provision pods when it receives requests. A rough state machine for a Knative service looks like:</p><ol><li id="2b52">When a service is created or updated, a revision is created initially in an inactive state. This corresponds to a Kubernetes deployment scaled to zero pods. In this inactive state, HTTP requests are routed to the Knative activator.</li><li id="a376">When an HTTP request is received for the service, the Knative activator queues the request and switches the current revision to an active state. Knative then scales the deployment up and switches the service to route to the deployment’s pods. Once the service is pointing at the deployment, the queued HTTP request is dispatched.</li><li id="e2bd">The Knative autoscaler monitors inbound request rate and scales the deployment as needed.</li><li id="d7e2">If the service doesn’t receive any HTTP requests after a configured timeout, the deployment is scaled back to zero, the revision is marked as inactive, and the service is switched back to the activator.</li><li id="e36d">Repeat from the beginning!</li></ol><p id="6a1c">For a cached container image, the whole activation process generally takes less than 2 seconds, quickly enough for our webhook handling use case. And for webhook triggers that only receive events every few minutes or less frequently, it saves us considerable cluster resources.</p><p id="a166">Installing Knative Serving is straightforward. You need their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRDs</a> and core components like the activator. Here we’ll use version 0.13.0, but check their <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installation instructions</a> for the latest version.</p><pre><span id="7fad">$ kubectl apply -f <a href="https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-crds.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-crds.yaml</a><br>$ kubectl apply -f <a href="https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-core.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-core.yaml</a></span></pre><p id="526b">Then you need to pick a networking layer, or gateway, to route requests.</p><p id="ce98">Like most Knative Serving users, we started by evaluating <a href="https://istio.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Istio</a>, a popular service mesh and ingress gateway offering for Kubernetes. However, Istio’s focus on connecting microservices didn’t really support our use case:</p><ol><li id="bb0c">We didn’t need the service mesh component of Istio at all, only its Envoy gateway. A complete Istio installation on our cluster consumed a lot of resources, most of which were ultimately going to waste.</li><li id="fcb1">Because we’re configuring webhook triggers dynamically from our database, we put our own reverse proxy in front of Knative Serving. It is difficult (although not impossible) to change the behavior of Istio to run as an internal-facing service instead of a public gateway.</li></ol><p id="8449">Most other networking layer options for Knative Serving were positioned more strongly as ingress gateways, focusing mainly on exposing services directly to the internet.</p><p id="6d47">Ultimately we settled on Ambassador because its lightweight single-container model made deploying it for our internal use case easy.</p><p id="dab8">For Relay, we use a custom Helm chart to set up the Ambassador API Gateway. We have a single deployment, an optional <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal pod autoscaler</a>, a service account with corresponding role bindings, and finally a ClusterIP service to use as the target networking layer for Knative.</p><p id="30e8">Our deployment YAML is largely the same as the one from the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/install/install-ambassador-oss/#1-deploying-the-ambassador-api-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador installation instructions</a> in <code>ambassador-rbac.yaml</code>. However, we must explicitly enable Knative support:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2cb9">Likewise, our service account and role bindings are similar to those in <code>ambassador-rbac.yaml</code>, but use <code>{{ .Release.Namespace }}</code> instead of <code>default</code>.</p><p id="d788">For the gateway service, note especially:</p><ol><li id="cd94">The <code>app.kubernetes.io/component</code> label must be present and set exactly to the value <code>ambassador-service</code> or Ambassador won’t pick it up to set the Knative service target correctly.</li><li id="7097">We use <code>type: ClusterIP</code> to make the service cluster-local. This instance of Ambassador won’t be reachable from the internet.</li></ol><figure><div></div></figure><p id="64eb">As a reference, you can find <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-helm-ambassador-knative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our entire Ambassador Helm chart on GitHub</a>.</p><p id="f282">Finally, we need to configure Knative to use cluster-local routing and Ambassador as its default gateway. Simply apply this manifest to your cluster using <code>kubectl apply</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7fb6">Now you can create a cluster-local Knative service. Use <code>kubectl apply</code> on a manifest like this:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="946e">Within a few seconds, Ambassador will process the service and set up a mapping for it. Assuming you installed Ambassador to the <code>ambassador</code> namespace, you’ll see this service when you run <code>kubectl get svc</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="5ec0">If you don’t see the service pointed at your Ambassador deployment, inspect the Knative service and ingress using <code>kubectl describe ksvc my-test-service</code> and <code>kubectl describe king my-test-service</code>. The status conditions and events should provide useful hints to remediate any problems.</p><p id="ecb0">Now we can try sending a request to the service by running a one-off pod:</p><pre><span id="cd00">$ kubectl run \<br>    --generator=run-pod/v1 internal-requester \<br>    --image=alpine --rm -ti --attach --restart=Never \<br>    -- wget -q -O - <a href="http://my-test-service.default.svc.cluster.local/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://my-test-service.default.svc.cluster.local</a><br>Hello World!<br>pod "internal-requester" deleted</span></pre><p id="8839">Yay!

If you don’t make any more requests, within a few minutes, that pod will be automatically terminated.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="63ca">You can view all the mappings Ambassador has configured for your Knative services by forwarding the admin endpoint of your deployment:</p><pre><span id="6e83">$ kubectl port-forward -n ambassador deployment/ambassador 8877<br>Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8877 -&gt; 8877<br>Forwarding from [::1]:8877 -&gt; 8877</span></pre><p id="2f40">Then navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/</a>.</p><p id="0b02">For Relay, we manage our Knative services by writing out a higher-level CRD that <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our operator processes</a>. This lets us perform lifecycle management operations more efficiently. For example, we create and clean up webhook triggers and workflow runs in batches we call tenants. We get a ton of value from the combination of Tekton, Knative, Ambassador, and our own operator, with relatively little cluster resource overhead.</p><p id="39f1">The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.getambassador.io/self-serverless-why-run-knative-functions-on-your-kubernetes-cluster-4914c706a083">developer use cases for Knative</a> fall into three categories:</p><ol><li id="025c"><strong>Replace glue/aggregation functions with Knative<br></strong>Function as a Service (FaaS) offerings have become popular as a way to deploy and run services that “glue” functionality together. The main challenge for development teams is that the workflow for deploying cloud-based FaaS is different than that for Kubenetes. If you’ve already invested in training engineers to work with Kubernetes, then the added time and money to train them is extraneous.</li><li id="83c3"><strong>Build smaller microservices as functions<br></strong>Some simple functions are event-driven and provisioning (or running) an entire microservice/app framework seems unnecessary. Knative provides “just enough” framework to deploy and manage the lifecycle of a very simple microservice or “nanoservice” using the primitives provided within modern language stacks.</li><li id="b407"><strong>Deploy high-volume functions, cost-effectively<br></strong>Pay-as-you go serverless offerings can be very cost-effective for certain use cases. For longer-running or high-volume functions, pay-as-you-go isn’t as practical. Running Knative on your own hardware, or even running this via Kubernetes deployed on cloud VMs, can enable the easier costing of execution when you know that you will be running a service that has high-volume traffic.</li></ol><p id="7ba9">Running on-demand microservices in your infrastructure is easier now than ever before. With the help of Knative and Ambassador, you can drastically reduce costs and resource utilization while maintaining clean separations of APIs across your environment.</p><p id="05c9">At the frontier of cloud-native experience, Knative also unlocks some very exciting opportunities that haven’t been practical in conventional deployment environments. In this post, we explored low-trust user-defined workloads using custom containers as one example, but there are many more!</p><ul><li id="7ae9">Install the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/tutorials/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>.</li><li id="2264">Install <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knative with Ambassador</a>.</li><li id="d1b5">Read the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/howtos/knative/#using-knative-and-ambassador" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation for using Knative and Ambassador</a>.</li><li id="d8f4"><a href="https://www.getambassador.io/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact the Ambassador team </a>to learn more about using Ambassador with Knative.</li><li id="6d68">Sign up for <a href="https://relay.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relay</a> to try webhook triggers yourself.</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><span><span>So FPS is, as it were, a total score, the number of images&nbsp;<em>per second.</em></span>&nbsp;<span>Since this does not say anything about the distribution of the images&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;that second, the fps score is unable to say anything about how smooth the experience actually is for the player.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span>
<p><span>It is therefore more interesting to look at the time it takes to render each frame (image).</span>&nbsp;<span>These are also known as&nbsp;<em>frame times</em>&nbsp;, and they are measured in milliseconds.</span>&nbsp;<span>A millisecond is one thousandth of a second and is often shortened to&nbsp;<em>ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>Because the images follow each other very quickly in an animation, this unit makes more sense than noting&nbsp;<em>0.001 seconds.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>If you want 60 fps without stutters at all times, no frame should take longer than 16.67 milliseconds to calculate and be displayed on your screen.</em></span><span>For 30 fps, your system can take it easy;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>there is a whopping 33.3 milliseconds.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you want to get 100 fps, that's just 10 milliseconds - less than a third of the time!</span></p>
<h2>
<span>The Achilles heel of the mean</span></h2>

<p><span>For frame times we therefore measure&nbsp;<em>per frame</em>&nbsp;the time it took to render that frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>Since each benchmark quickly takes a few minutes, we are talking about thousands of 'scores' (values).</span>&nbsp;<span>It would be very easy to calculate an average from all this data, but then we are effectively no further than with an FPS score;</span>&nbsp;<span>after all, an average says very little about the consistency and outliers within the series.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jrEKYSAaOqI/XsLi8DYjE4I/AAAAAAAAAOM/JzG4Z13P6_8xOitnBnqLcQL_Ekg1C-6pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082182_grafiek_ms2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="361" data-original-width="600" height="384" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jrEKYSAaOqI/XsLi8DYjE4I/AAAAAAAAAOM/JzG4Z13P6_8xOitnBnqLcQL_Ekg1C-6pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082182_grafiek_ms2.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span>Which system is performing better now?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the averages, both systems arrive at 30 fps.</span>&nbsp;<span>On this basis, we therefore see no difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the graph, it is immediately clear that system B with its two outliers does not offer such a smooth experience as system A.</span></p>

<p><span>Now that we know that we should not focus on an average (fps), the question arises: what can be used?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we measure the frame times in a benchmark or test, and thereby collect&nbsp;<em>tens of thousands of</em>&nbsp;scores, how can these be made transparent?</span>&nbsp;<span>Making a graph for each second tested as above is a lot of work, and you probably already quit after ten pieces.</span>&nbsp;<span>To do this in a compact and efficient way, we use percentiles.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>A percentile is a term from the statistic, and is calculated by ordering all frame times from lowest to highest and dividing it into 100 parts of equal size.</span>&nbsp;<span>That way you will get a better overview of the distribution of all data.</span>&nbsp;<span>For example, if it is the 60th percentile, then 60 percent of all frame times is equal to or less than this number, and 40 percent higher.</span>&nbsp;<span>If a test shows that the 90th percentile is 13.3 ms, 90 percent of all measured frames are ready in 13.3 ms or faster.</span></p>

<p><span>Do you remember the previous graph ?</span>&nbsp;<span>Below are a similar chart with again one second of test data on two systems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="300" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span>The average of these two systems is again not that interesting, because they both achieve an average frame time of 33.3 ms which means 30 fps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>We get a better overview if we sort all scores in the chart from low to high as below.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="301" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>With the increasing frame times in this graph, the picture is a bit less chaotic than the previous graph.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the order from low to high, the best (lowest) frame times are therefore on the left, and the worst (which cause the annoying stutters) on the right.</span>&nbsp;<span>This is also how a percentile graph works, only percentiles are used for the horizontal axis.</span>&nbsp;<span>A line graph is also used instead of a bar chart (the 'bars').</span>&nbsp;<span>Then the graph will look like this:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="323" data-original-width="600" height="344" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We know that frame times are preferably as low as possible, but especially that we want to see as few high frame times as possible.</span>&nbsp;<span>That sounds like the same thing, but there is a difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the example above, the game runs at 30 fps and the monitor shows 30 images per second, so there is 33.3 ms time to prepare per frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>In that case, the frames that are ready in less time have no extra value, they are not shown before.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you want your game to run as fast as possible, low frame times are desirable, but even then consistency is also important for the best experience.</span>&nbsp;<span>The higher frame times on the right of the graph are the cases that disrupt the smooth experience.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>
<span>Low frame times, high percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>When discussing frame times, the 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentile are commonly used values.</span>&nbsp;<span>Why?</span>&nbsp;<span>Because with this data, we can make a solid statement about how well a game or benchmark is running for most of the time.</span>&nbsp;<span>We are not just looking for the worst frame time, we want to know how consistent the experience is across the board.</span>&nbsp;<span>An incidental stutter is almost inevitable and often not fully predictable - and sometimes just a measurement error.</span></p>

<p><span>The 99th and 99.9th percentile is also regularly indicated with&nbsp;<em>1%</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>0.1%</em>&nbsp;<em>lows</em>&nbsp;at frame times&nbsp;<em>,</em>&nbsp;which is effectively the same (the 1 and 0.1 percent worst frame times) - it just rolls a bit easier.</span>&nbsp;<span>In addition, some publications convert the percentiles in frame times back to fps, in order to make the information more accessible.</span>&nbsp;<span>Many readers can usually imagine better at&nbsp;<em>75 fps</em>&nbsp;than at&nbsp;<em>13.3 ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>In itself we understand that choice, but it should be kept in mind that 'in' 75 fps (a second with 75 frames) an inconsistent follow-up of frames can still take place.</span>&nbsp;<span>This mainly depends on which percentile it concerns: converted 75 fps as 99th percentile is much more consistent than as 90th percentile.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Finally</span></h2>
<p><span>For those who examine frame times, a world of detailed information opens up.</span>&nbsp;<span>Compared to the&nbsp;<em>frames per second</em>&nbsp;measure, it is much more accurate to measure how smooth the animation is and how pleasant the gaming experience will be.</span>&nbsp;<span>Moreover, there are a variety of options for comparisons;</span>&nbsp;<span>not only determine what the better video card is, but also, for example, which processor is suitable for gaming, how much an overclocking on your cores or your memory makes, the difference between different driver versions and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>That the importance of frame times has been underlined with this article does not mean that the fps benchmark can be trashed.</span>&nbsp;<span>As long as frame times remain consistent, the proportions in relevant equations will remain the same</span></p>
<p><span><span>In this article we have talked about what exactly frame times mean, how they relate to fps, how the calculations are made, what the percentiles mean and how you can read and interpret all these test data.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you also want to get started and do these measurements on your own PC, programs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/ocat/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh7ywfCE3ogo8D8QpExdhs-ba5knw">OCAT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-nC6YtO_Hj4jx-GwmEb9dFzOe0g">FrameView are</a>&nbsp;good options for logging in, but especially&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://github.com/DevTechProfile/CapFrameX&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4raip_SAYtm11y0fc40AjzmlyRA">CapFrameX</a>&nbsp;is recommended to provide insight into the large amounts of data in an instant.</span></span></p>

                    <p>API keys, passwords, and customer data are accidentally posted to GitHub every day. </p><p>Hackers use these keys to login to servers, steal personal information, and rack up absurd AWS charges. GitHub leaks can cost a company thousands–or even millions–of dollars in damages. Open-source intelligence gathering on GitHub has become a powerful arrow in every security researcher's quiver: researchers from NC State even wrote an <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_04B-3_Meli_paper.pdf">academic paper</a> on the subject. </p><p>This article, written for both bug bounty hunters and enterprise infosec teams, demonstrates common types of sensitive information (secrets) that users post to public GitHub repositories as well as heuristics for finding them. The techniques in this article can be applied to <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> snippets, too.</p><p>In the last year, I've earned nearly $10,000 from bug bounty programs on <a href="https://hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> without even visiting programs' websites thanks to these techniques. I've submitted over 30 Coordinated Disclosure reports to vulnerable corporations, including eight Fortune 500 companies. </p><p><strong>I've also released <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a>, an open-source tool designed to automate the process of finding keys across GitHub.</strong> GitHound isn't limited to a single user or organization: it sifts through all of GitHub, using Code Search queries as an entrypoint into repositories and then using context, regexes, and some other neat tricks to find secrets.</p><h2 id="github-code-search">GitHub Code Search</h2><p>Before we get into the automated tools and bug bounty strategies, let's talk about Code Search. </p><p>GitHub provides <a href="https://github.com/search">rich code searching</a> that scans public GitHub repositories (some content is omitted, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-code#considerations-for-code-search">like forks and non-default branches</a>). Queries can be simple like <code>uberinternal.com</code> or can contain multi-word strings like &nbsp;<code>"Authorization: Bearer"</code>. Searches can even target specific files (<code>filename: vim_settings.xml</code>) or specific languages (<code>language:SQL</code>). Searches can also contain certain <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax">boolean qualifiers</a> like <code>NOT</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. </p><p>Knowing the rules of GitHub code search enables us to craft search dorks: queries that are designed to find sensitive information. GitHub dorks can be found online, but the best dorks are the ones that you create yourself.</p><p>For example, <code>filename: vim_settings.xml</code> (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Avim_settings.xml&amp;type=Code">try it!</a>) targets <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-tools-settings-repository.html">IntelliJ settings files</a><a>.</a> Interestingly, the <code>vim_settings.xml</code> file contains recent <strong>copy-pasted strings encoded in Base64</strong>. I recently made $2400 from a bug bounty with this dork: SaaS API keys and customer information were exposed in <code>vim_settings.xml</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/vim_settings.png"></figure><p><code>vim_settings.xml</code> only contains recently copy-pasted strings, but we can exploit the repository's commit history to find the <strong>entire copy-paste history.</strong> Just clone the repository and run <a href="https://gist.github.com/tillson/620e8ef87bc057f25b0a27c423433fda">this 14-line script</a>, and the user's activity will be at your fingertips. GitHound also finds and scans base64 encoded strings for secrets, even in commit history.</p><p>By the way: with <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22vim_settings.xml%22&amp;type=Commits">a GitHub commit search dork</a>, we can quickly scan all 500,000 of commits that edit <code>vim_settings.xml</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/commits.png"></figure><h2 id="search-heuristics-for-bug-bounty-hunters">Search Heuristics for Bug Bounty Hunters</h2><p>GitHub dorks broadly find sensitive information, but<strong> what if we want to look for information about a specific company?</strong> GitHub has millions of repositories and even more files, so we'll need some heuristics to narrow down the search space. </p><p>To start finding sensitive information, identify a target. </p><p>I've found that the best way to start is to <strong>find domains or subdomains that identify corporate infrastructure.</strong> </p><p>Searching for <code>company.com</code> probably won't provide useful results: many companies release audited open-source projects that aren't likely to contain secrets. Less-used domains and subdomains are more interesting. This includes specific hosts like <code>jira.company.com</code> as well as more general second-level and lower-level domains. It's more efficient to find a pattern than a single domain: <code>corp.somecompany.com</code>, <code>somecompany.net</code>, or <code>companycorp.com</code> are more likely to appear only in an employee's configuration files. </p><p>The usual suspects for open-source intelligence and domain reconnaissance help here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute">Subbrute</a> - Python tool for brute-forcing subdomains</li><li><a href="https://www.threatcrowd.org/">ThreatCrowd</a> - Given a domain, find associated domains through multiple OSINT techniques</li><li><a href="https://censys.io/">Censys.io</a> - Given a domain, find SSL certificates using it</li></ul><p>GitHound can help with subdomain discovery too: add a custom regex <code>\.company\.com</code> and run GitHound with the <code>--regex-file</code> flag.</p><p>After finding a host or pattern to search, play around on GitHub search with it (I always do this before using automated tools). There are a few questions I like to ask myself here:</p><ol><li><strong>How many results came up?</strong> If there are over 100 pages, I'll likely need to find a better query to start with (GitHub limits code search results to 100 pages).</li><li><strong>What kind of results came up?</strong> If the results are mostly (intentionally) open-source projects and people using public APIs, then I may be able to refine the search to eliminate those.</li><li><strong>What happens if I change the language?</strong> <code>language:Shell</code> and <code>language:SQL</code> may have interesting results.</li><li><strong>Do these results reveal any other domains or hosts?</strong> Results in the first few pages will often include a reference to another domain (e.g. searching for <code>jira.uber.com</code> may reveal the existence of another domain entirely, like <code>uberinternal.com</code>).</li></ol><p>I spend most of my time in this step.</p><p>It's crucial that the search space is well-defined and accurate. Automated tools and manual searching will be faster and more accurate with the proper query.</p><p>Once I find results that seem interesting based on the criteria above, I run it through <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a><a> </a>with <code>--dig-files</code> and <code>--dig-commits</code> to look the entire repository and its history. </p><p><code>echo "uberinternal.com" | ./git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits</code></p><p><code>echo "uber.com" | ./git-hound --dig-files --language-file languages.txt --dig-commits</code></p><p><code>echo "uber.box.net" | ./git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits</code></p><p>GitHound also locates interesting files that simply searching won't find, like <code>.zip</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> files. Importantly, I also manually go through results since automated tools often miss customer information, sensitive code, and username/password combinations. Oftentimes, this will reveal more subdomains or other interesting patterns that will give me ideas for more search queries. It's important to remember that open-source intelligence is a recursive process.</p><p>This process almost always finds results. Leaks usually fall into one of these categories (ranked from most to least impactful):</p><ol><li><strong>SaaS API keys</strong> - Companies rarely impose IP restrictions on APIs. AWS, Slack, Google, and other API keys are liquid gold. These are usually found in config files, bash history files, and scripts.</li><li><strong>Server/database credentials</strong> - These are usually behind a firewall, so they're less impactful. Usually found in config files, bash history files, and scripts.</li><li><strong>Customer/employee information</strong> - These hide in XLSX, CSV, and XML files and range from emails all the way to billing information and employee performance reviews.</li><li><strong>Data science scripts</strong> - SQL queries, R scripts, and Jupyter projects can reveal sensitive information. These repos also tend to have "test data" files hanging around.</li><li><strong>Hostnames/metadata</strong> - The most common result. Most companies don't consider this a vulnerability, but they can help refine future searches</li></ol><h2 id="workflow-for-specific-api-providers">Workflow for Specific API Providers</h2><p>Dorks can also be created to target specific API providers and their endpoints. This is especially useful for companies creating automated checks for their users' API keys. With knowledge of an API key's <strong>context</strong> and <strong>syntax</strong>, the search space can be significantly reduced. </p><p>With knowledge of the specific API provider, we can obtain all of the keys that match the API provider's regex and are in an API call context and then we can check them for validity using an internal database or an API endpoint. </p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/graph.png"><figcaption>A workflow for finding secrets for a single API provider</figcaption></figure><p>For example, suppose a company (HalCorp) provides an API for users to read and write to their account. By making our own HalCorp account, we discover that API keys are in the form <code>[a-f]{4}-[a-f]{4}-[a-f]{4}</code>. </p><pre><code># Python
import halapi
api = halapi.API()
api.authenticate_by_key('REDACTED')

# REST API with curl
curl -X POST -H "HALCorp-Key: REDACTED" https://api.halcorp.biz/userinfo
</code></pre><p>Armed with this information, we can compose our own GitHub dorks for HalCorp API responses: </p><pre><code># Python
"authenticate_by_key" "halapi" language:python

# REST API
"HALCorp-Key"
</code></pre><p>With a tool like <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a><a>,</a> we can use regex matching to find strings that match the API key's regex and output them to a file:</p><p><code>echo "HALCorp-Key" | git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --regex-file halcorp-api-keys.txt --results-only &gt; api_tokens.txt </code></p><p>Now that we have a file containing potential &nbsp;API tokens, and we can check these against a database for validity (<strong>do not do this if you don't have written permission from the API provider</strong>).</p><p>In the case of HalCorp, we can write a bash script that reads from stdin, checks the <code>api.halcorp.biz/userinfo</code> endpoint, and outputs the response.</p><p><code>cat api_tokens.txt | bash checktoken.bash</code></p><p>Although awareness of secret exposure on GitHub has increased, more and more sensitive data are published each day. </p><p>Amazon Web Services have begun <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-notifications-when-your-aws-accounts-root-access-keys-are-used/">notifying users if their API keys are posted online</a>. GitHub has added <a href="https://github.com/features/security">security features</a> that scan public repositories for common keys. These solutions are merely bandaids, however. To limit secret leaks from source code, we must update API frameworks and DevOps methodologies to prevent API keys from being stored in Git/SVN repositories entirely. Software like <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> safely stores production keys and some API providers, like Google Cloud Platform, have updated their libraries to force API keys to be stored in a file by default.</p><p>Fully eradicating exposure of sensitive information is a more difficult problem: how can customer information be fully detected? What if it's in a Word, Excel, or compiled file? More research must be conducted in this field to study the extent of the problem and its solution.</p>

				<p>You've probably heard of a Lean Startup approach to building a business, but what about a Lean DevOps approach to scaling your development team?</p><p>To explain the difference between traditional DevOps and Lean DevOps, let's start at a cloud's eye view and work our way down.</p><p>The definition of traditional DevOps, as defined by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/#:~:text=DevOps%20is%20the%20combination%20of,development%20and%20infrastructure%20management%20processes.">AWS</a>, is:</p><blockquote>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/traditional-devopscycle-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Lean DevOps makes a key distinction in the fact that it aims to not just bring velocity to the surface, but also simplicity. As such, Lean DevOps is defined as:</p><blockquote><em>Lean DevOps is a development philosophy that focuses on both velocity and simplicity via a combination of culture, best practices, and workflow automation tools.</em></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/lean-devops-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Not only is traditional DevOps a major challenge for small companies trying to compete for skilled people, but those same startups also have the most promising opportunity to scale DevOps as part of their organizational structure and culture. In doing so, DevOps can be optimized using a lattice-style team philosophy where generalists and specialists are both leveraged and nurtured.</p><p>And Lean DevOps works. The <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/state-of-devops-report/">2019 State of DevOps Report</a> showed that companies who have high performing DevOps programs deploy software not only <strong>200 times more frequently</strong>, but also have <strong>2,555 times faster lead times</strong> for their projects. In addition, they also <strong>recover 24 times faster from failed changes</strong>, with <strong>three times lower change fail rates</strong>.</p><p>That equates to not just faster development, but faster business. You’ll reach milestones, OKRs, and goals earlier, and before your competition does. Thus, bringing developer tools into the realm of revenue generation and not just cost savings.</p><h2 id="-300b-in-lost-developer-productivity">$300B in Lost Developer Productivity</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/dev-productivity_cto.ai-2.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Currently, DevOps is fragmented across innumerable tools and technologies. Developers have also been tasked with workflow automation, but this burns valuable time that could be used to build features for paying customers.</p><h3 id="often-you-ll-see-two-main-devops-challenges-">Often you’ll see two main DevOps challenges:</h3><ol><li><strong>Many companies struggle to adopt DevOps practices.</strong></li><li><strong>DevOps tools are far more complex than ever before.</strong></li></ol><p>That’s why <a href="https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">$300 billion in developer productivity is lost every single year</a> within growing development teams.</p><p>Technical leaders know that, as their teams grow, it is critical to invest in the workflows that their teams require to work. However, it can be too time-consuming to allocate their critical internal resources.</p><p>That’s why a Lean DevOps approach is so important. It allows teams to remain lean, automate repeated workflows, and use tools and behaviors that increase simplicity and velocity.</p><h2 id="the-10x-engineer-is-dead">The 10X Engineer Is Dead</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/10x-engineer-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And that’s why the 10X engineer is dead. Or, more appropriately, they never existed. However, a team’s ability to have a 10X impact is still very much alive.</p><p>Taking a Lean DevOps philosophy can work the same magic, but instead, focus on making a team of five engineers 2X as productive.</p><p>All they need to do is build the right culture, utilize industry best practices, and implement the best tools.</p><p>You can also consider building an organizational structure that unblocks your team like a lattice formation (pictured above) or holocracy-style team makeup that promotes a flat organization with limited bureaucracy and decentralized management.</p><p>These are frameworks for encoding autonomy, agility, and purpose-alignment into your organization's DNA.</p><h2 id="5-ways-to-build-a-culture-of-delivery">5 Ways to Build a Culture of Delivery</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/teamvelocity-process-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, how do I move to the Lean DevOps light, you ask? Well, here are five steps to follow while implementing and scaling your lean culture.</p><ol><li><strong>Stick with lean process for as long as possible.</strong> Don’t give in until it’s the right moment. Stay lean allows you to move quickly in the early stages of a company.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Choose boring technology, invest wisely. </strong></strong></strong>Take time to pick the tools that increase simplicity in your workflows.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Onboarding sets expectations. </strong></strong></strong>Don’t just drop a new tool at your team’s feet. Implement a rollout plan and lay out the education with it.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Create a platform for success. </strong></strong></strong>Lead by example to live and breath your new-found Lean DevOps philosophy.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>ICE: Impact + Confidence / Effort. </strong></strong></strong>Balance your workload by debating with data and leveraging your highest value initiatives.</li></ol><p>Take the time necessary to get buy-in for a culture shift from your team. It's never easy, but if you do it right in the beginning the effects will become much more ingrained in your sprints.</p><h2 id="scaling-with-lean-devops">Scaling with Lean DevOps</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/devops-over-time-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Remember, as your team scales you’ll move from a flatter organization to an Agile matrix one.</p><p>This will also affect your team velocity as process complexity increases.</p><p>So, as you scale, here are ways to stay within the Lean DevOps methodology:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Stay flat, fewer managers. </strong></strong></strong>Maintain accountability through transparency via tools like Slack and its companion app marketplace.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Strategic vertical workstreams. </strong></strong></strong>Track product milestones in tools like Jira to provide visibility and a longer-term vision.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Holistic horizontal specialization. </strong></strong></strong>Think about research and development, security, and codebase specialization as wide thoughts that span business functions.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Don’t lose the ability to build a generalist culture. </strong></strong></strong>A team of polymaths will aide your problem solving and creative thinking.</li></ul><p>At the end of the day, there is no perfect process, but a combination of assets.</p><p>Tools with bottom-up adoption, a flat organizational structure to speed things up, adaptability, and a balance between velocity and stability are your targets.</p><p>Welcome to the delivery culture of Lean DevOps. Your team will thank you.</p><p>***</p><p><em>To learn about Lean DevOps in video form press play below.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4Q6xEeVYSY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed-->

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is about the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a> project, an XMPP library
for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>.
Some parts of this post may apply exclusively to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp@v0.16.0">v0.16.0</a>.

<p>Go is a great language if you need to get a project off the ground quickly. It
has its confusing aspects, and its type system allows for lots of abuse thanks
to <a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/2017/08/the-case-for-interface/">optional dynamic typing</a>, but overall it’s easy to read and easy to quickly
build projects that require clear code over absolute type safety.
Similarly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XMPP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has its warts, but overall is the best choice to get a
chat product off the ground quickly if you want a system that’s well understood
and has a robust ecosystem and sustainable standards body.</p>
<p>Since Go shines at handling I/O bound services (like asynchronous network
protocols used for instant messaging), an XMPP library in Go seems like a great
fit.
There are a handful of libraries to handle XMPP already in existence, but most
of them are small high-level libraries designed only to work with the legacy
version of XMPP that was supported by Google Talk, or don’t follow Go idioms and
best practices.
When I started looking into a Go XMPP implementation around 5 years ago, there
wasn’t a low-level library meant to act as a building block from which higher
level systems could be created, and that’s what I wanted: the equivalent of the
standard libraries <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>net/http</code></a> but for XMPP.
This is why I created <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a>.
This post will be about some of the design decisions I made while building the
library, and about some of the trade offs made along the way.</p>
<h2 id="stream-features">Stream Features</h2>
<p>Let’s start by talking about feature negotiation.
An XMPP session can broadly be divided up into two parts: the synchronous
initial handshake, and the actual asynchronous session.
Within this initial handshake, a series of common features are negotiated in a
certain order.
For example, if TLS isn’t already in use, opportunistic TLS (StartTLS) might be
negotiated, followed by authentication.
This ends up being a loop where the server sends any features it wants to
advertise at the current moment (eg. just TLS) then the client chooses one to
negotiate and proceeds with that features specific negotiation steps.
Then the server sends another list (possibly with new features, eg. now that we
have TLS negotiated the server might advertise that authentication is now ready
to proceed) and the client selects one and moves forward.
This loop is easy enough to write in Go, but representing the features
themselves was tricky.
Features need to be able to encode the name they go by when the server lists
them and any information that should be included in that listing, they need to
be able to parse that payload from the clients side, and the actual negotiation
from the server and clients side needs to happen.
To handle this a struct containing three functions for listing features, parsing
the features list, and negotiating the features was created.
This means less boilerplate and more type safety than using an interface to
represent a stream feature.
It also makes it less likely that a user of this API will get confused and write
stateful stream features, but if necessary the functions can still close over
external state or resources (but don’t do this, you may think you need it, but
you’re almost certainly wrong).</p>
<pre><code>type StreamFeature struct {
	Name xml.Name

	Necessary SessionState
	Prohibited SessionState

	List func(ctx context.Context, e xmlstream.TokenWriter, start xml.StartElement) (req bool, err error)
	Parse func(ctx context.Context, r xml.TokenReader, start *xml.StartElement) (req bool, data interface{}, err error)
	Negotiate func(ctx context.Context, session *Session, data interface{}) (mask SessionState, rw io.ReadWriter, err error)
}
</code></pre><p>We also need to have a way to encode the order features should appear in (eg.
auth should not be attempted before TLS).
I decided that features would order themselves based on the state of the
session at the moment when feature negotiation happens.
The feature would say what properties of the session are or are not allowed, and
the thing doing negotiation can determine whether the session currently meets
those criteria.
Session state information only has 4 properties that are useful for session
negotiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a security layer in place (eg. TLS),</li>
<li>has authentication been performed,</li>
<li>is feature negotiation complete, and</li>
<li>was the session initiated by a remote entity?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are part of the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#SessionState"><code>SessionState</code></a> bits, so in the stream features we can
encode what bits are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamFeature.Necessary">necessary</a> and what bits are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamFeature.Necessary">prohibited</a> and the state
machine that handles session negotiation will be able to figure out when to
advertise or negotiate the feature using simple bit math.</p>
<pre><code>const (
	// Secure indicates that the underlying connection has been secured. For
	// instance, after STARTTLS has been performed or if a pre-secured connection
	// is being used such as websockets over HTTPS.
	Secure SessionState = 1 &lt;&lt; iota

	// Authn indicates that the session has been authenticated (probably with
	// SASL).
	Authn

	// Ready indicates that the session is fully negotiated and that XMPP stanzas
	// may be sent and received.
	Ready

	// Received indicates that the session was initiated by a foreign entity.
	Received

	…
)
</code></pre><h2 id="session-negotiation">Session Negotiation</h2>
<p>Once we have a set of features that we can negotiate, we need to do the actual
session negotiation.
Normally, XMPP negotiates a session over TCP using the features loop that we
already described, however, sometimes an alternative mechanism might be required
for negotiation such as the websocket subprotocol defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7395">RFC 7395</a> or the
legacy <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol</a>.
Generalizing session negotiation meant allowing the user to provide a special
negotiator function and writing a default one for the basic XMPP stream
negotiation protocol.</p>
<pre><code>type Negotiator func(ctx context.Context, session *Session, data interface{})
  (mask SessionState, rw io.ReadWriter, cache interface{}, err error)
</code></pre><p>Because the negotiator can’t change the session state if it’s written in another
package (since the session state bits aren’t exported), it returns any changes
it wants to be made to the session such as the new session state mask, or any
changes to the underlying reader and writer (eg. if we negotiate StartTLS it
might return a new reader and writer that speak TLS).
The internal code that calls the negotiator function can then create a new
session with the requested changes.</p>
<p>The builtin negotiator can be created with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewNegotiator"><code>NewNegotiator</code></a> and supports
various options such as setting the stream language and copying the input and
output streams somewhere else (such as an XML console):</p>
<pre><code>// StreamConfig contains options for configuring the default Negotiator. 
type StreamConfig struct {
	// The native language of the stream.
	Lang string

	// S2S causes the negotiator to negotiate a server-to-server (s2s) connection.
	S2S bool

	// A list of stream features to attempt to negotiate.
	Features []StreamFeature

	// If set a copy of any reads from the session will be written to TeeIn and
	// any writes to the session will be written to TeeOut (similar to the tee(1)
	// command).
	// This can be used to build an "XML console", but users should be careful
	// since this bypasses TLS and could expose passwords and other sensitve data.
	TeeIn, TeeOut io.Writer
}

// NewNegotiator creates a Negotiator that uses a collection of StreamFeatures
// to negotiate an XMPP client-to-server (c2s) or server-to-server (s2s)
// session.
// If StartTLS is one of the supported stream features, the Negotiator attempts
// to negotiate it whether the server advertises support or not.
func NewNegotiator(cfg StreamConfig) Negotiator
</code></pre><p>It uses stream features as discussed in the previous
section, but custom negotiators could be written that use a different type for
stream features, making session negotiation and stream features entirely
modular.
You could replace them with your own implementations, and still use the <code>xmpp</code>
package to handle the lower level XMPP protocol.</p>
<p>An example of a custom stream negotiator can be found in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/component"><code>xmpp/component</code></a>
package which negotiates a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol</a>
connection.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-data">Receiving Data</h2>
<p>Once the session is negotiated, we need to be able to receive stanzas (the
primitive types of XMPP) and other top level XML elements over the session.
Because the main <code>xmpp</code> package is meant to be lower level than many other XMPP
libraries written for Go, it does not contain callbacks or any way to register
handlers for different types of top level XML element.</p>
<p>Instead, it contains a single <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Session.Serve"><code>Session.Serve</code></a> method that decodes all incoming
XML tokens and delegates handling them to a single <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Handler"><code>Handler</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>// A Handler triggers events or responds to incoming elements in an XML stream.
type Handler interface {
	HandleXMPP(t xmlstream.TokenReadEncoder, start *xml.StartElement) error
}
</code></pre><p>The <code>Serve</code> method also handles stanza semantics such as always responding to
IQs as required to be compliant with the XMPP protocol.
Because the handler is provided with a stream to use when writing back to the
session, the underlying library can man-in-the-middle the token stream and check
if an IQ response was written and automatically send one if not, or add required
IDs to stanzas that are missing them.</p>
<p>This design also keeps the number of methods on the session relatively low and
keeps the entire library more modular because we can delegate multiplexing
elements to more specific handlers to other packages such as the builtin
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/mux"><code>xmpp/mux</code></a> package.
If a user wants a more advanced multiplexer that buffers the stream and matches
stream elements based on <a href="https://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200320131503/http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm">Clark notation</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/all/">XPath</a>, they could
write it themselves and it would have all the same powers and access as the
built in muxer!
The <code>mux</code> package also provides more specific handlers for the basic XMPP stanza
types: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/mux#IQHandler"><code>IQHandler</code></a>, …</p></section></div>

<p>This post intends to showcase programming patterns, or <em>stuff</em>, which is common between Newsqueak, Alef, Plan9 C, Limbo, and Go.</p>
<p>All of these code snippets should be complete as shown and compilable/runnable in the state presented. The Alef examples might have subtle typos, but this is due to the fact I had to manually re-type them out from VirtualBox since I didn’t have copy/paste available to the guest.</p>
<p>Commentary has been inserted before examples where I believe it will be helpful.</p>
<p>If I missed a feature or misreported a fact, feel free to open an issue/PR against <a href="http://github.com/henesy/blog">the blog on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Articles or posts talking about Go’s predecessors have a habit of referring to the languages listed above, but can fail to provide concrete resources for seeing how these languages work. This post aims to provide a reference for such languages.</p>
<p>I find being able to play with languages and see complete programs showing how the language fits together as a whole rather than just small snippets extremely valuable for learning.</p>
<p>In particular with older languages, it can be difficult to find ways to practically experiment with the language and get a feel for the ergonomics of the error reporting, building of complex programs, etc. without having access to the compiler/interpreter/environment itself. As such, paths to being able to write in these languages have been provided for each language presented.</p>
<p>Note that this reference is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>

<section data-level="1" id="camera-on-or-off-a-ux-approach-to-video-meeting-fatigue">

<section data-level="3" id="video-conferencing-is-the-new-office-living-room-dinner-table-doctors-office-"><h3>Video conferencing is the new office / living room / dinner table / doctors office...</h3>
<p>As the spaces of our social lives have transitioned to a limited number of software interfaces, fatigue and burnout has skyrocketed taxing our mental health and productivity. While video conferencing apps are keeping us employed and connected, they are not prepared to handle this mass shift in our daily routines and social interactions. </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="what-makes-video-conferencing-so-different-"><h3>What makes video conferencing so different?</h3>
<p>When we spend our days sitting in our makeshift offices and personal spaces staring at our coworkers, friends, doctors, teachers and families (and don’t forget ourselves!) in little boxes on our screens we miss so much of the social experience of real face to face interactions. We’re unable to read body language, engage in normal social rituals, have serendipitous conversations—to move!</p>
<p>We’re also responding to a unending amount of new information that our brains need to process—our personal lives surrounding us at home, the apartments and houses of our coworkers and their personal lives happening around them, the host of distractions on our desktops and the lure of almost unnoticeable multitasking. </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-ui.jpg" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="can-the-design-of-our-meeting-software-help-"><h3>Can the design of our meeting software help?</h3>
<p>As a UX designer working to build a video conferencing platform, it’s been crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the medium in hopes of easing some of the fatigue with features designed not to replicate in person communication but to uncover and build on the strengths of a relatively new space.    </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="improving-our-new-space-the-meeting-room"><h3>Improving our new space - The meeting room</h3>
<p>We spend so much care and effort creating the physical spaces we occupy, and these spaces have a known effect on our mental health as well as our productivity, creativity and sociablility. A black box filled with poor quality images littered with icons can feel like spending all day in a messy room with no windows—of course we’re exhausted after a day of video meetings! But what can we do to make these new rooms feel like  sleek, light filled rooms with all the personal touches that we invest so much thought into? </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-meetingroom.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The furniture, if you will, of these new spaces is entirely different. Instead of tables, whiteboards and light switches we have new furniture that has to replicate everything else missing from in person interaction—all those icons littered about. Unmute is the desk of a virtual meeting room.</p>
<p>Designing meetings rooms for Team.video has strived to take into account interior design principles as well as UX best practices. Does a glaring red mute icon create more stress and visual clutter than it provides important functional information? Our process has been one of many iterations, focusing on light colors, subtle gradients and subdued accents.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="camera-on-or-off-"><h3>Camera on or off?</h3>
<p>We’ve never been more aware of the green light at the top of our screens. In almost daily research sessions over the past few months I've yet to encounter a team that has found the golden solution to the camera on or off question. </p>
<p>Companies that had a camera on policy have switched to camera optional and those with a camera optional approach have switched to camera on. Some teams use cameras only for smaller meetings or only require those speaking to use video. </p>
<p>Camera off can feel less personal but also removes the need to process so many different faces and backgrounds at once. While being on camera for the majority of a day is incredibly exhausting and not always necessary for productive work meetings. </p>
<ul>
<li>There is probably no golden solution, but some design attention can greatly improve both sides of the coin. </li>
<li>A more aesthetically pleasing camera off view that still includes the face of a coworker and a signal when/that they are speaking. </li>
<li>Flexible layouts for different scenarios—one speaker, a handful of speakers, screenshare brainstorm etc. </li>
<li>The option to hide or minimize your own video. </li>
<li>Blurred or custom backgrounds for camera on mode—which can be a lot of fun and also a potential new distraction. </li>
</ul>

</section>

<section data-level="3" id="meetings-start-very-abruptly"><h3>Meetings start VERY abruptly</h3>
<p>All of a sudden you’re face to face with an unfamiliar coworker, from your bedroom...and the person who called the meeting is running late. This scenario is unique to telecommuting. Maybe you regularly walk to the conference room with a coworker, or you introduce yourself politely and take the first few minutes of a meeting to fill your water bottle while everyone else arrives. </p>
<p>All of this is much more awkward over video. Small talk is less natural with mute/unmute issues, lack of non verbal cues and often bandwidth time delays. Widespread goals to keep meetings efficient encourage us to get straight to the point, which can be jarring. </p>
<p>How can UX help those first few meeting minutes? </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to know who is already in the meeting before you join so you can decide if you want to be one on one with a C level you’ve never met. </li>
<li>Arrive looking (and sounding!) your best with a pre-meeting ‘haircheck’ where meeting goers can check their audio/video before entering the meeting</li>
<li>Low effort social interaction built in to the welcome minutes. At team.video we’ve implemented an optional word game that early arrivers can play against each other in lieu of or in addition to any amount of small talk. </li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="keep-trying-new-things-"><h3>Keep trying new things!</h3>
<p>Design is always about observing, trying and testing. With team.video we’ve been able to explore some ideas larger companies have not and we’d love to hear any thoughts or issues that you’ve encountered in our software or others! </p>

In my experience doing software consulting, I’ve seen and worked on some projects where the founders take 2 - 3 months to launch the first version of their product. That’s too much time and effort sunk into a project that may not work.</p><h2>Why you need to get your Minimum Viable Product out ASAP</h2><p>The problem is that most people are not comfortable with launching a minimum viable product. Founders are often creative people who love to explore and dive into “wouldn’t it be cool if”s. This habit can result in a continuous loop of adding features, even before the first version of your product is released.</p><p>Perfectionism can often get in the way of execution, and I’ve fallen for this trap many times. My first product (SideQuest) took me four months to build and launch. To continue developing an untested product is, to put it bluntly, arrogant. Here’s why: it assumes that what you are making is vital for your customer. It assumes that you know what’s best for your user. You don’t.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>No founder knows until they launch their startup and get feedback from people. Your first version is likely going to suck; it might even miss the mark or be utterly irrelevant to the market. You need to get any negative and positive signals from your target market as soon as possible.</p><p>That was what we tried to do with MeetButter. Everyone on our team has had experience getting burnt by wasting time, runway, effort, and emotion building products or features that were inconsequential in the larger picture.</p><p>Here’s the story of how we managed to build and ship MeetButter in three weeks.</p><h3>Step 1 - Identification</h3><figure>

    <figcaption>It started with a thread</figcaption>
  </figure><p>The first spark for MeetButter was a Slack thread discussing the pains teachers and educators were dealing with transitioning their classrooms from offline to online. We found that there was a very human problem with online video conferencing - they only allowed the focus to one speaker at a time. It was awkward interrupting the speaker, and this caused some participants to feel reluctant to engage. The discussion thread grew, with more anecdotes and feedback from our friends and family.</p><p>Identifying the problem is the first step. It’s crucial to figure out the groups of people that are facing the same issues and gathering feedback from them. </p><h3>Step 2 - Investigation</h3><p>We decided to take this asynchronous discussion and organize a synchronous brainstorm session. During this particular session, we discussed three significant problems that we had identified and were interested in solving. On the list was the aforementioned “video conferencing” - which eventually became MeetButter.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Breaking down the current video conferencing experience</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Some significant points were brought up by everyone on the team, and we found that these were problems that each one of us had faced while doing online video conferencing:</p><ol><li>It’s difficult to indicate an interest in speaking, reply to the current conversation, or add to the discussion without feeling like you’re interrupting the current speaker.</li><li>It’s impossible to transition smoothly between one speaker to the next. Sometimes mid-sentence pauses are met with several speakers trying to enter into the conversation at once. Combined with lag, this can get quite awkward.</li><li>The avoidance of awkwardness causes some people to remain quiet.</li><li>The loudest voice in the room problem - some people naturally dominated discussions.</li><li>Social cues are almost non-existent when your entire team gets boxed into tiny windows on-screen and are only visible from their shoulder up.</li></ol><p>The purpose of this brainstorm was not to narrow down into solutions, but it was to dive deep into the problems.</p><div><p>Adam is typing something... (Click to reveal)</p><p><img src="https://adamthewan.com/static/adam-head-0b2b466e69071c2bd52efa9911165bc6.png"></p></div><h3>Step 3 - Sketching</h3><p>After the brainstorm session, we discussed some ideas on how to tackle the problem. Solutions can seem pretty vague, and usually, what happens is that several keywords get thrown around. For us, it was “queue,” “overlay,” and “polls.” It’s good to note that people often visualize keywords differently and form very different concepts in their heads. </p><p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Sketching is an essential skill to learn for any founder, as it’s the best medium to transfer your ideas with a low signal-noise ratio. People often misunderstand your words. If you’re not good at drawing, it’s good to learn how to sketch out a prototype digitally using free tools like Figma. I have even used Google Slides to build a low fidelity prototype for a client once! Sometimes I even screenshot parts of other apps and combine them into a Frankenstein of an image - anything to help bridge the gap between your vision and their imagination.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Sketch of the app that turned into MeetButter</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Based on the feedback and ideas from the team, this was the very first sketch for MeetButter that I built using Figma. After sharing it on our team Slack, we held a meeting to discuss the steps moving forward. We decided to cut out some features and instead focus on the queuing functionality as we were able to test it internally during our daily standup calls.</p><h3>Step 4 - Prototyping</h3><p>I won’t go into too much detail about how we built the prototype. This step will be different for every team: some teams will opt to do a no-code prototype using tools like AirTable and Google Forms; some will choose to do a “simulated” prototype using Figma or Zeplin; some will opt to build a fully functioning albeit minimal prototype using code. We decided to do the latter as it was the fastest for me to code something quickly.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Once you have your prototype, you need to get it in front of some test users. Finding test users can be tricky.  Ideally, the test users should be from within your team; this was the case for us with MeetButter. It meant that we were building a product for ourselves, that we were part of our target market. Building a product to solve your problems has some apparent benefits: </p><ol><li>It creates a shorter and more efficient feedback loop.</li><li>It’s easier to innovate on issues you face</li><li>It somewhat validates your market.</li></ol><p>If you are building a product that’s not for yourself, I’d suggest finding at least ten people within your networks who can become your loyal test users.</p><p>MeetButter was also super easy to integrate into our daily workflow. All we had to do was open up the web app during our regular standup calls. It’s essential to build some sort of feedback loop. I sent a Google Form to the participants of the meeting to gather initial feedback as soon as the meeting ended - it’s best to strike while the iron is hot. We also had several Slack threads discussing additional ideas that came up as we continued testing.</p><h3>Step 6 - Reiteration</h3><p>After testing our prototype, we collected the feedback and went back to the drawing board. At this point, you have to make a clear decision with your prototype - do you continue to reiterate, or do you kill the project? We found that our prototype worked quite well, and although we were skeptical, there was a sense that we were onto something. We started using the prototype in every meeting, so it was hard to deny that our team internally found it useful.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>We repeated the process of designing, reiterating, and receiving feedback several times. Our testing group grew from our internal team of five people out to our friends within our social circles.</p><h3>Final Step - Launch</h3><p>After a few rounds of iterations, our prototype slowly shed its pieces and morphed into something resembling a product. As soon as we exhausted our immediate networks, we knew that the next step was to launch MeetButter beyond internal test users.</p><p>I began to lay the groundwork for a codebase that could grow into a scalable project. Our tech stack ended up being the following:</p><ul><li>Frontend - NextJS with Redux and GraphQL</li><li>Backend - A mix of Firebase and an Express server that’s powered by Apollo GraphQL and Sequelize</li><li>Infrastructure - We used Netlify and AWS to deployment</li></ul><figure>

  </figure><p>Several factors allowed us to build and ship MeetButter quickly.</p><p>Firstly, we were fortunate to have had the experience and the skills to execute quickly. We didn’t run into many technical limitations, as each one of us had filled the significant roles that were needed. These roles include design/UI UX, software development, and marketing/networking.</p><p>Secondly, we tried to follow the best practices for idea generation. The brainstorm that led to MeetButter wasn’t the first one that we had together. It was probably our fifth brainstorm session after getting together as a team as Project Phoenix. With a lot of practice, we were able to build a set of best practices to have productive brainstorm sessions, get feedback, and reiterate.</p><p>Thirdly, we were close to our target market, which allowed us to test fast and slowly expand our test userbase.</p><p>Fourth, we threw perfection out the window. Our prototype didn’t work 100% of the time, had a bunch of bugs, and built with the bare minimum UI. Despite this, we still used it every single day for our video calls. It was good …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            
<p><em>Hi, I’m Edurne (Eddie), writer &amp; support intern here at Datawrapper and aspiring data journalist. Today’s Weekly Chart is about a question I’ve frequently asked myself in the last few years: can civil resistance foster social change and revolution?</em></p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a foreign correspondent in Kenya, Japan, and Spain. It was not always easy, but I was lucky to learn many interesting things along the way. I was also constantly on the ‘wire’, reading stories from many countries and learning about their past, culture, and daily lives.</p>
<p>Even before that, while I was studying journalism, I  found myself reading and writing a lot about protests, like the <em>Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong</em> or the <em>Yellow Vests</em> (<em>Gilets Jaunes</em>) movement in France. The images from the Arab spring in 2010 stuck with me the most. And it’s not a coincidence that I read about protests so much: <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/10/political-protests-have-become-more-widespread-and-more-frequent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last few decades have seen an increase in campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>But not all protests are the same: There are violent and peaceful ones. I was wondering: Which of them are successful? To find out, I used data from The Non-violent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (<a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/navco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAVCO</a>) project by Harvard University, the first of its kind to collect systematic data on violent insurgencies and non-violent civil resistance around the world:</p>





<p>NAVCO gathered data on 622 campaigns between 1900 and 2019. As we can see in the chart, in this time, half of the <strong>321 non-violent campaigns succeeded, while only a quarter of their 301 violent counterparts</strong> did. 56% of violent campaigns failed, compared to 30% of non-violent ones.</p>
<p>Erica Chenoweth, a researcher on violence and co-author of the NAVCO Data Project, found even more evidence that non-violent protests are more successful: “Countries in which there were nonviolent campaigns were about 10 times likelier to transition to democracies within a five-year period compared to countries in which there were violent campaigns – whether the campaigns succeeded or failed”, she explained to <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/02/why-nonviolent-resistance-beats-violent-force-in-effecting-social-political-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Harvard Gazette</a>.</p>
<p>You can search through all the 622 campaigns that the NAVCO data set contains here:</p>





<h2 id="Data-concerns">Data concerns</h2>
<p>Because it’s a data set collected by hand instead of measured, it’s important to understand the decisions behind it better.</p>
<p>Launched by Harvard University, the NAVCO Data Project covers different aspects of civil resistance and insurgencies through time. For this article, I decided to analyze the 4th iteration of the project: the <strong><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ON9XND" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAVCO 1.3 data set</a></strong>, released on March 17 of this year.</p>
<p>While making statements like “non-violent campaigns are more successful”, we need to bear in mind that this data set might not include all campaigns, suffering a so-called <strong>underreporting bias</strong>. The authors of the NAVCO data set also note in their codebook that the included <strong>non-violent campaigns</strong> are <strong>biased toward success:</strong> the large, mature campaigns are most commonly reported. Some non-violent campaigns are crushed in their infancy (and therefore fail) and are not included in this data set.</p>
<p>This bias has, however, been mitigated by looking only at major campaigns with at least 1,000 people participating in the protest. The dataset also only includes protests with a maximalist objective, such as bringing down a government. Despite not being perfect, the NAVCO Data Project is still a reference <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/hu-imo012420.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for many researchers and journalists</a> to analyze the effects of both violent and non-violent protests in global politics.</p>
<h2 id="The-process">The process</h2>
<p>One thing I like about data visualization (although it can be daunting) is the amount of trial and error that it requires to come up with the right chart type. The table I finally created was not close to my first idea (at the beginning I wanted to create a scatterplot or even a map!), which shows that visualization can be really rich in variety as well!</p>
<p>Before looking at the data set, I started with a blank piece of paper and wrote down my initial questions. I believe this step comes from my journalistic background: <strong>I treat data sets as interviewees</strong>. The main question – are non-violent protests more or less successful than violent ones? – was easily answered with a pivot table in Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The main work needed to be done on the Datawrapper table. To help readers navigate this big amount of data, I opted for the use of <strong>emojis</strong> in the <strong>“Success”</strong> column. Now you just need a glance to know how the campaign ended. I also decided to bring ongoing campaigns to the front of the table, since those are the insurgencies and protests that are happening at the moment and people have likely been reading about them in the last few years. Finally, I decided to <strong>highlight the non-violent campaigns that ended up in success</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="References">References</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_6ee"><div><p>Throughout school, I was a bookworm and an introvert. “Socializing” was not my cup of tea. I was never really sure about how to drive any deep conversations or connect with another person. As an introvert, every time I tried doing so, my self-doubt and social anxiety would creep in. I felt as if I might sound extremely weird, boring, or that the other person might judge me. These thoughts kept me from freely opening up about myself.</p><p>I often thought: “If I manage to be good at my work and communicate the same, it should be enough to reach where I want to. Why make deep conversations?”.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Thus, I often neglected my interpersonal skills.</p><h2>Plot twist – The story that led me to reconsider things</h2><p>In my final year of school, I found myself clouded with many negative thoughts. This even affected my academic performance. I started oversleeping. I could not find anyone to share my thoughts with. I constantly had the fear that no one would relate to me.</p><div><p>However, I learned to deal with those thoughts during my drop year by connecting with spirituality and analyzing things deeply. It also made me realize that things needed to change. I was not going to keep to myself.</p><p>So, when my college started, as part of my growth plan, I decided to go out of my comfort zone every time I got the chance. I had several great conversations with my colleagues, members in communities and conferences, and even those pursuing completely different career paths. As a result, I found some great mentors, lifetime buddies, and many meaningful connections who continue to inspire me.</p></div><p>All throughout, I have realized some common behavioral patterns while having these conversations. I now find myself a lot more comfortable walking into situations and striking a conversation, or even driving them with no/minimal anxiety.</p><h3><strong>But why should I be good at this art of deep conversations and have meaningful connections?</strong></h3><p>You are ultimately going to work with people and for people, directly or indirectly. You have to learn to empathize.</p><p>It enables you to do better teamwork and bring out great products.</p><p>On a personal level, meaningful connections are liberating. They can help accelerate your process of knowing yourself better and also help keep your stress levels in check.</p><p>We all help each other grow. You learn to support the people around you even if you cannot fix their problems.</p><p>The list can go on.</p><p>All this prompted me to reflect on things that worked out. I was eventually able to derive 15 lessons that I will be sharing in this blog post.</p><p>I am not claiming to be an expert, there are still many lessons to be learned. But I hope these lessons help you out if you struggle with having a great conversation with anyone. Or if you are having trouble in maintaining meaningful connections, the way I used to do.</p><p>Some of these points are great life advice too.</p><h2>1. Accept yourself the way you are</h2><p>Yes, it all starts with you!</p><div><p>Over the years, I have realized that self-acceptance helps you comfortably become a part of any conversation. When you start being true to yourself and embrace your uniqueness, it solves your self-esteem issues. And you stop seeking validation from others. </p><p>Self-exploration takes time.</p></div><p>Enjoy your own company. Reflect upon your strengths, weaknesses, values, ambitions, behavior, and things you need to fix within yourself. This would keep on evolving as you continue to learn, unlearn, and relearn things.</p><p>Know that you matter, that you can add value and your story is worth listening to. Give yourself those affirmations you seek from others.</p><p>Do not try to imitate a person. If their personality inspires you, bring their good habits/traits into your routine, and see what works out best for you!</p><h2>2. Be curious</h2><p>Being curious definitely helps you professionally. Curiosity helps in grasping new concepts and exploring how different things work. It can also do wonders on a personal level. Approaching every interaction with genuine curiosity helps you connect better with others, including strangers, and drive conversations naturally.</p><p><span><em><strong>“When curiosity is alive, we are attracted to many things; we discover many worlds.”</strong></em></span> <em>–Eric Booth</em></p><div><p>Being curious makes you more observant. You tend to actively listen and take a genuine interest. It drives you to ask better and more intriguing questions that make people think. For example –</p><p>Let us say someone mentions one of their future goals as moving out to US/Germany and work there. You can respond in two ways:</p></div><div><p>“Oh, amazing. I hope that happens soon.”</p><p>or:</p></div><p>“That sounds great. Though I would love to know what made you choose US/Germany over any other country. Have you been there before? Or anything specific you admire about them?”</p><div><p>The first phrase would rush your conversation directly to the end. The second one will drive the flow naturally. It will make the other person open up more. You can end up learning new things about these countries that you were not aware of. </p><p><strong>Curiosity makes you look beyond superficial</strong>. You do not assume. You seek clarity for things you might have misunderstood.</p></div><div><p>But, avoid being too interrogative and prefer open ended-questions over simple yes/no ones.</p><p>Socially engineer the other person, appear more open and interested. I do not think I can explain it better than Gilfoyle explaining it in this episode of Silicon Valley xD</p></div><figure><p> <iframe title="Silicon Valley - Gilfoyle vs HR [Part 2]" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItFi_08B4wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>(I just love this character from Silicon Valley.)</p><h2>3. Learn to empathize with others</h2><p>“<em>Empathizing is the ability to understand emotions in others and share their feelings</em>”.</p><p>Empathizing is important. You should try actively listening to a person and imagining yourself in their situation to see how they would have felt. Recognize their emotion, understand, and acknowledge their pain points.</p><div><p>Sharing your own experiences instead of critiquing. A shared perspective makes the other person feel understood. It builds a level of trust with the other person. You can learn to empathize by starting to acknowledge and naming your own feelings when you have them.</p><p>Do not sympathize, <strong>Empathize! </strong></p></div><p><strong>Few things to keep in mind:</strong> Empathizing doesn’t require you to always have a solution to someone else’s problem. Rather, it is listening to them actively. Make them feel understood, which will prompt them to open up and seek advice.</p><p>Here is an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraclick/want-to-be-more-empathetic-avoid-these-7-responses-21bb52d5d2ad" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">read</a> on empathy and how to empathize in different situations.</p><p><strong>What if the other person is way too negative about things that annoy you?!</strong><br>In such cases, be honest with them by conveying how you feel about it. You don’t always need to agree with the other person to acknowledge their perspective. If a person just repeatedly complains without taking any action, you know they are someone you will not connect with deeply and that’s totally OK.</p><h2>4. Allow yourself to be vulnerable</h2><div><p>As per a research conducted by Dr. Brene Brown, vulnerability is the root of human connection. Yet, we are taught to hide our true emotions, struggles, and portray ourselves as a “normal” confident being. We avoid being vulnerable due to the fear of getting betrayed. Or as quoted by Dr. Brown – minimizing <strong>“<em>uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure</em>”.</strong></p><p>I highly recommend watching the widely viewed Ted talks by Dr. Brown to learn the Power of vulnerability:</p></div><figure><p> <iframe title="The power of vulnerability | Brené Brown" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCvmsMzlF7o?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>As she mentions, when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, it opens us to joy, love, gratitude, empathy, and connection. Vulnerability is not about disclosing a big, dark secret but saying things that are difficult for you to share. It is not a sign of weakness but rather <em>indicates that you are strong enough to admit your true emotions</em>. It is OK to feel low, to show your humanistic side.</p><p>There is also a price that we pay for invulnerability:</p><figure><p> <iframe title="The price of invulnerability: Brené Brown at TEDxKC" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UoMXF73j0c?start=685&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p><em>If you want the other person to open up, you yourself need to be vulnerable first</em>. Everyone wants to be heard. They just need a safe space and trust factor to talk about their struggles.</p><p>Put your ego and pride aside. Do not try to always be in control. When you allow yourself to be vulnerable first, you create this safe space for the other person to do the same naturally. But, never mishandle this information or use it against that person, it can make them feel worse.</p><p>We choose to sympathize to avoid feeling vulnerable. Empathizing (#3) requires a sense of vulnerability and sharing your own story. But do not overshare or dwell too much on the negative. Have a sense of awareness as to when to open up.</p><h2>5. You cannot please everybody, and you should not even try to</h2><p>While on the journey of forming long-lasting meaningful connections, it is essential to get rid of toxicity. Stay careful about who you get close to. I am very thankful to a friend who gave me this bold advice last year while going through a sour experience:</p><div><p>Leave people who drain your energy and those who do not add any value. The people who bear unusual behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable and who do not respect your boundaries even if you have clearly stated them are best avoided. </p><p>The way you want to be treated is totally in your hands. Never compromise on your mental peace.</p></div><p> <strong>“<em>Do not deny the signs, vibes, and energy you feel about certain people and situations. If it’s not right, it’s not right.”</em></strong><em> – Idil Ahmed</em></p><p>There is another perspective to this point, in terms of the effect of the ease with which we connect via social media at our fingertips. You do not need to be available all the time to reply to messages. Many people time your responses, expecting you to reply within minutes. But, those who really wish to connect must respect your time. They should understand that you might be occupied. They will surely reach out again or call you up for any urgent help instead of taking things in a negative way. Never compromise on your “me” time.</p><h2>6. Do not beat yourself up</h2><p>If a conversation went awkward or did not go as expected, that does not mean that you are awkward. There might be many hidden factors around it, due to which it did not go well. Do not give it a lot of thought. If you did something embarrassing, laugh at your own mistakes. Derive the lessons from that interaction and move on.</p><p>No …</p></div></div></div>

Perseverance is based on Curiosity’s design, but has <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/wheels/" target="_blank">redesigned &amp; more durable aluminum wheels</a>, better <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/" target="_blank">skycrane</a> and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing/" target="_blank">landing navigation</a> systems, additional improved cameras, Mars’ <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/microphones/" target="_blank">first microphones</a>, a larger drill (that can “<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7555" target="_blank">cut intact rock cores, rather than pulverizing them</a>”), an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Oxygen_ISRU_Experiment" target="_blank">ISRU experiment</a> that makes oxygen from CO2, more advanced autonomous navigation, and a very <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/" target="_blank">different set of instruments</a>. Both rovers are powered by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission_radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator</a> (MMRTG), allowing full time operation, with Perseverance carrying a unit left over from Curiosity. Oh, and Perseverance has a <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/" target="_blank">helicopter drone</a> (cf. <a href="https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2020-05-12-Issue-64/" target="_blank">Issue 64</a>)! Perseverance is scheduled to launch at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/the-launch-is-approaching-for-nasas-next-mars-rover-perseverance" target="_blank">9:15 a.m. EDT July 20</a>—any later than mid-August and it’ll need to wait two years for the next Mars launch window. If the flight goes as planned, it will land in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><strong id="how-would-the-mars-sample-return-mission-work">How would the Mars Sample Return mission work?</strong> NASA recently <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/20/nasa-narrows-design-for-rocket-to-launch-samples-off-of-mars/" target="_blank">settled on a solid-fuel design</a> for their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), the small (max 400 kg), two-stage rocket that will hopefully carry the samples, left on the surface of Jezero Crater by Perseverance, into orbit. Once there, it will perform the first autonomous rendezvous between two spacecraft beyond the Earth-Moon system, and transfer its samples into the care of <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/Europe_prepares_for_Mars_courier" target="_blank">ESA’s electrically-propelled Earth Return Orbiter</a> (ERO).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div id="content"><div id="post-767"><div id="post_content"><p><span>Companies like Zoom, Instagram, Slack, and Apple have taken their respective markets by storm. There are of course a variety of factors as to why. But one commonality they share is the extreme focus on making </span><b>important</b><span> tasks take close to </span><b>zero time and effort </b><span>using their products. </span><span>Even when it’s at the expense of great pain by the product team such as the </span><a href="https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d">attention to every pixel at Slack</a><span>. Or at great financial cost such as improving battery life by a few minutes through </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273006/apple-expenses-for-research-and-development/">multi-billion dollar R&amp;D budgets at Apple</a><span>. These companies won people over by choice in heavily saturated spaces. Markets that numerous giants operated in long before them. So how did they know what to build and when to keep investing?</span></p><p><span>While analyzing 10s of products and iterating with 100s of millions of users at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and smaller startups I’ve developed a battle tested theory of how. A lot of ideas are cross applied to product from statistics, machine learning, and AI since that’s what my background is in. </span><span>By putting this theory to practice you can assess exactly how every change within your product affects the various markets your customers are representative of. It also lets you evaluate if your product is easy to use with quantitative certainty.</span></p><p><span>It’s important to point out the nuances of this approach and what it doesn’t do. Not all products have to be easy to use to build a company around them. Look at Salesforce and any IBM product. They just have to make important tasks easier than today for people you know how to sell to. </span><span>Also, there’s still no shortcut to figuring out what to build other than qualitative research with real people, probing markets with an MVP, and learning about a domain. </span></p><p>What this theory does help you with is evaluating the worth of your solution within different markets that use your product. It can also inspire ideas by highlighting what your existing user base already “hacks” with your product. Lastly, by observing exactly how various personas in your product react to changes you build you can understand what’s important to them so you know what areas to focus on.</p><p><span>I, along with my 2 co-founders believed in this theory so much that we all quit our $200k-300k jobs at Microsoft over 2 years ago in order to productize it at </span><a href="https://productmarketfit.ai/"><span>ProductMarketFit.AI</span></a><span>. Our goal is to make it accessible to everybody including side projects, startups, and consultants without requiring hiring a 25 person data science team like larger enterprises do.</span></p><p><span>I’m going to split this post into 2 parts. Part 1 is focused on:</span></p><ol><li>Building survival vs. pleasure technology</li><li><span>Evaluating ease of use quantitatively&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p><span>Part 2 is focused on:</span></p><ol><li><span>Evaluating the importance of tasks for your user base</span></li><li><span>Probing markets with your product</span></li></ol><p><span> I’m always growing and learning so I look forward to all types of discussion. Feel free to reach out to me on any platform. Now to it.</span></p><p><span>The reason humans do anything roughly falls into two buckets:</span></p><ol><li><span>Survival</span></li><li><span>Pleasure</span></li></ol><p><span>We brush our teeth, earn money, and sleep so we can continue pain-free existence. When there’s time to spare we long for love, revel in our accomplishments, and get dopamine hits from entertainment.</span></p><p><span>When negative experiences such as a crappy boss, loneliness, boring tasks, and an aching back invade our experience we lose pleasure in life. Small pains grow into big ones through repetition and large pains can quickly eat away at our happiness.</span></p><p><b>Happiness over time</b></p><p><img data-attachment-id="791" data-permalink="https://philippcannons.com/the-theory-behind-making-something-people-want/product-technical-happiness-over-time/" data-orig-file="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg" data-orig-size="2560,1158" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Product &amp; Technical – Happiness over time" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-300x136.jpg" data-large-file="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1024x463.jpg" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1158" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1024x463.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-768x347.jpg 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1536x695.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-2048x927.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1024x463.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-768x347.jpg 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1536x695.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-2048x927.jpg 2048w"></p><hr><p><b>In one statement:</b></p><p><i><span>Humans strive to maximize the longevity of their positive subjective experience.</span></i></p><hr><p><span>The point of technology is to make survival easy and maximize pleasure.

concerns around:</span></p><ol><li><span>Do individuals get to benefit from inventing collapse technology forever if they secure it through a monopoly?</span></li><li><span>What should happen when there is enough technology to ensure survival for everyone but it’s owned by a tiny % of people?</span></li><li><span>What if the tasks left are extremely complicated and out of reach for most people to learn how to do?</span></li></ol><p><span>I’m aware these concerns exist but it’s out of scope for this post. If you are interested in the topic, Kurzgesagt did </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk"><span>this excellent video about it</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>While the demands of survival are clear, how we derive pleasure is much more varied. It is the long tail of wants. There are of course obvious ones which directly tie into our visceral pleasure center such as food and sex. I would argue they make up a relatively small portion of our time. A much more time consuming part of our existence in this category is dealing with the emotional soup that is our subjective experience.</span></p><p><span>Our subjective experience is influenced by genetics, environment, actions, and beliefs. Internal ego drivers vary drastically and whether a solution is able to deliver on ones you enjoy is hard to predict. It’s also very hard to know how many people share that unique set of circumstances and desires to determine whether it can sustain a successful company. That’s why you see a bunch of weird consumer startups pop up all the time.</span></p><p><span>The successful consumer products usually identify an often contrarian chunk of this emotional soup through a stroke of genius, luck, or personal experience. Products that find an initial way in then iterate to retrofit their product more and more to the internals of how our minds work. If they are able to do so repetitively, they stay in business and grow.</span></p><p><span>It would be silly to try to summarize a framework for building pleasure technology.

<b>Abstract.</b> ACM's 2018 A.M. Turing Award was about
<em>deep learning</em> in artificial neural networks.
ACM lauds the awardees for work based on algorithms
and conceptual foundations first published by other researchers 
whom the awardees failed to cite
(see </a><a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>
and Sec. 
<a href="#I">I</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>,
<a href="#XII">XII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>, 
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>,
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>, 
<a href="#XIV">XIV</a>,  
<a href="#XX">XX</a>, 
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>).
ACM explicitly mentions "astonishing" deep learning breakthroughs in 4 fields:
<a href="#A"> (A) speech recognition</a>, 
<a href="#B">(B) natural language processing</a>, 
<a href="#C">(C) robotics</a>, 
<a href="#D">(D) computer vision</a>,
as well as "powerful" new deep learning tools in 3 fields: 
<a href="#VII">(VII) medicine, astronomy, materials science</a>.
Most of these breakthroughs and tools, however, were directly based on 
the results of my own labs in the past 3 decades 
 (e.g., Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a>,
<a href="#B">B</a>,
<a href="#C">C</a>,
<a href="#D">D</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>). 
I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history (e.g., Sec. 
<a href="#II">II</a>,  
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>) 
and also 
mention 8 of our direct priority disputes 
with Bengio &amp; Hinton (Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>, <a href="#I">I</a>).

<p>
<em>This document (~11,000 words)
reuses and expands some of the material in my <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html">Critique of the 2019 Honda Prize</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> (~3,000 words). 
It has several layers of hierarchical abstraction: 
<b><a href="#abstract">Abstract</a></b> (150 words), <b><a href="#exec">Executive Summary with links to details</a></b> (~1,000 words), <b><a href="#I">Body with 21 comments on 21 claims by ACM</a></b> (~7,700 words) and <b><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></b> (~1,700 words). 
All backed up by  <a href="#References">over 200 references</a> (~6,500 words).
</em>

</p><hr>


<p>We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others.
Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal <em>Nature</em>:
<b>"Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that 
science is self-correcting"</b> <a href="#SV20">[SV20]</a>.
Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a> <a href="#DL2">[DL2]</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> <a href="#NASC1">[NASC1-9]</a>. The present page is offered as a resource for computer scientists who share this inclination. 
By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations and crediting the original inventors, 
I am not diminishing important contributions made by popularizers of those inventions. 
My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts, to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning,
and to fight plagiarism in all of its more or less subtle forms. 
I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant 
references (send them to <em>juergen@idsia.ch</em>). 



</p><p> I will focus on 
contributions praised by
ACM's official justification <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> of the 
2018 A.M. Turing Award for Drs. Bengio &amp; Hinton &amp; LeCun  <a href="#R1">[R1]</a> 
 published in 2019.
After the <a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>,
ACM's full text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> is split into 21 parts  
labeled by "<b>ACM:</b>" 
<a href="#I">I</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>, 
<a href="#III">III</a>, 
<a href="#IV">IV</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,

<a href="#IX">IX</a>,

<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>,
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>.
Each part is followed by a critical "<b>Comment</b>." 
Most of the comments are based on references to original papers and other material from
 recent 
blog posts <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>  <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a>.
<b>I'll point out 
that  highly cited publications of the awardees ignored fundamental 
relevant prior work—this may be the reason for some of  ACM's misattributions.</b>
Since ACM's text is a bit repetitive and redundant, so are the partially overlapping
sections of  my critique. 



</p><h2><a name="exec">

Executive Summary (~1000 words, with links to details)
<hr>
</a></h2><a name="exec">

</a><p><a name="exec">
While Drs. LeCun &amp; Bengio &amp; Hinton (<b>LBH for short</b>)  
have made  useful improvements of algorithms for 
artificial neural networks (<b>NNs</b>) 
and deep learning (e.g., </a><a href="#I">Sec.  I</a>), ACM lauds
them for more visible 
work based on fundamental methods whose inventors they did not cite,
not even in later surveys
(this may actually explain some of  ACM's misattributions). I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history.
Numerous <a href="#References">references</a> can be found under the relevant section links I-XXI 
which adhere to the sequential order of ACM's text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a>
(while this summary groups related sections together).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#II">II</a>:</b> 
In contrast to ACM's claims, 
NNs for pattern recognition etc. were introduced long before the 1980s. 
 <b>Deep learning with multilayer perceptrons started in 1965</b> through Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa
long before LBH who have never cited them, not even in recent work.
<b>In the 1980s,</b> "modern" gradient-based learning 
worked only for rather shallow NNs,
<b>but it became really deep in 1991 in my lab,</b>
first through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">unsupervised pre-training of NNs</a>, 
then through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">supervised LSTM</a>.
<b>Sec.  <a href="#I">I</a></b> contains 4 subsections 
<b><a href="#A">A</a>, <a href="#B">B</a>, <a href="#C">C</a>, <a href="#D">D</a></b>
on <b>the  4 deep learning "breakthroughs" explicitly 
mentioned by ACM</b>. ACM does not mention that they were 
mostly based on deep learning techniques of my team:

</p><p>
<b>Sec.
<a href="#A">A: Speech Recognition</a></b> (see also <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp; <a href="#XV">XV</a>): The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition 
combines two methods from my lab: <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a> (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006), applied to speech in 2007. 
Hinton (2012) and Bengio (<a href="#XV">XV</a>)
still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s;
Hinton et al. (2012) did not compare it to 
our revolutionary CTC-LSTM (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">which was soon on most smartphones</a>).

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#B">B: Natural Language Processing</a></b> (see also  <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp;  <a href="#XVI">XVI</a>): 
The first superior end-to-end neural machine translation  
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">soon used for several billions of
translations each day by the big platform companies</a>)
was also based on our <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#C">C: Robotics</a></b>.
Our LSTM trained by <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> (RL) was also the core of the 
most visible breakthroughs in robotics and video games.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#D">D: Computer Vision</a></b>
(see also   
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIV">XIV</a>  &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a>  &amp;  <a href="#VI">VI</a>)
was revolutionized by <b>convolutional NNs</b> (CNNs).
The basic CNN architecture is due to Fukushima (1979). 
NNs with convolutions were later (1987) combined by Waibel with backpropagation and weight sharing, 
and applied to speech. <b>All before</b> LeCun's CNN work  (<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>).
We showed twice (1991-95 and 2006-10) that 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">deep NNs 
don't need unsupervised 
pre-training</a> (in contrast to Hinton's claims). Our team (Ciresan et al.)  
made CNNs fast &amp; deep enough for  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">superior computer vision  in 2011</a>,
<b>winning 4 image recognition contests in a row
before Hinton's team won one</b>. ResNet (ImageNet 2015 winner)
is a special case of our earlier <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html">Highway Nets</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XIV">XIV:</a></b>
Again ACM recognizes work that failed to cite the pioneers.
Long before Hinton (2012), Hanson (1990) had a variant of <b>dropout</b>, 
and v. d. Malsburg (1973) had <b>rectified linear neurons</b>; Hinton did not cite them.
Already in 2011,
our deep &amp; fast CNN  more than <b>"halved the error rate for object recognition"</b> (ACM's wording) 
in a computer vision contest 
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">where LeCun participated</a>), 
long before Hinton's similar CNN (2012). 
<b>Sec. <a href="#XI">XI</a>:</b>  ACM mentions GPU-accelerated NNs  
pioneered by Jung &amp; Oh (2004). LBH
did not cite them.
Our deep GPU-NN of 2010 debunked <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">unsupervised pre-training (introduced by myself in 1991 and later championed by Hinton)</a>, 
and our GPU-CNN of 2011 was the first  
to win contests in <b>computer 
vision</b> (explicitly mentioned by ACM).
 

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a></b>:
ACM credits LeCun for developing CNNs. However, the foundations of CNNs were laid earlier by 
Fukushima and Waibel  (Sec. <a href="#D">D</a>).
 ACM also explicitly mentions <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>medical image analysis</b>.
The first team to win relevant international contests in these fields 
through deep CNNs was ours (2011, 2012, 2013).
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#VII">VII</a>:</b> ACM explicitly mentions  <b>medicine</b> and
 <b>materials science</b>. Our deep NNs were the 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html">first to win medical imaging competitions</a>
 in 2012 and 2013, and the first to apply deep NNs to material defect detection in industry (since 2010).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#XII">XII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIX">XIX</a> &amp; <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> Modern 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">backpropagation</a>
was first published by Linnainmaa (1970), 
not by LeCun or Hinton or their collaborators (1985) who did not cite Linnainmaa,

 		<p>“Use managed services.”</p>
<p>If there was one piece of advice I wish I could shout from the mountains to all cloud engineers, this would be it.</p>
<p>Operations, especially operations at scale, are a hard problem. Edge cases become commonplace. Failure is rampant. Automation and standardization are crucial. People with experience running software and hardware at this scale tend to be rare and expensive. The mistakes they’ve made and situations they’ve learned from aren’t easy to pick up.</p>
<p>When you use a managed service from one of the major cloud vendors, you’re getting access to all the wisdom of their teams and the power of their automation and systems, for the low price of their software.</p>
<p>A managed service is a service like AWS relational database service, Google Cloud SQL or Azure SQL Database. With all three of these services, you’re getting best of breed configuration and management for a relational database system. There’s configuration needed on your part, but hard or tedious tasks like setting up replication or backups can be done quickly and easily (take this from someone who fed and cared for a mysql replication system for years). Depending on your cloud vendor and needs, you can get managed services for key components of modern software systems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>File storage</li>
<li>Object caches</li>
<li>Message queues</li>
<li>Stream processing software</li>
<li>ETL tools</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that these are all components of your application, and will still require developer time to thread together.)</p>
<p>You should use managed services for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s going to be operated well. The expertise that the cloud providers can provide and the automation they can afford to implement will likely surpass what you can do, especially across multiple services.</li>
<li>It’s going to be cheaper. Especially when you consider employee costs. The most expensive AWS RDS instance is approximately $100k/year (full price). It’s not an apples to apples comparison, but in many countries you can’t get a database architect for that salary.</li>
<li>It’s going to be faster for development. Developers can focus on connecting these pieces of infrastructure rather than learning how to set them up and run them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A managed service doesn’t work for everyone. If you need to be able to tweak every setting, a managed service won’t let you. You may have stringent performance or security requirements that a managed service can’t meet. You may also start out with a managed service and grow out of it. (Congrats!)</p>
<p>Another important consideration is lock-in. Some managed services are compatible with alternatives (kubernetes services are a good example). If that is the case, you can move clouds. Others are proprietary and will require substantial reworking of your application if you need to migrate.</p>
<p>If you are working in the cloud and you need a building block for your application like a relational database or a message queue, start with a managed service (and self host if it doesn’t meet your needs). Leverage the operational excellence of the cloud vendors, and you’ll be able to build more, faster.</p>

Note that the emulator is over 6x slower. On an ARM Mac, the amd64 image will instead be 6x slower.</p></div><p>Why can't you update the Docker image to also support ARM? You theoretically could switch your backend to run ARM Linux. However, this would take months - renting out ARM instances, re-building all repositories, and a tense switch over. What if your hosting provider doesn't offer ARM instances with the same system requirements as x86_64? What if you complete this migration and find it runs at half the speed?</p><p>Worse, it might be impossible if your images include files downloaded off the internet, as those are often only compiled for x86_64.</p><div><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/phantomjs-615e9c8bc9d2deb5ca62a4533c1299d6.png"></p><p>An example of a Docker command that will only work on x86_64. PhantomJS does not release an arm build.</p></div><p>While moving your backend to ARM is far from impossible, it's a serious migration that you shouldn't take lightly. Getting a new laptop isn't enough justification to switch your backend architecture.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>run Docker remotely</strong>. You set up an x86_64 Linux server, then allow Docker to connect to it remotely. From then on, all Docker commands instead run on the server. This is also supported in Docker, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-a-remote-docker-server-to-speed-up-your-workflow">here</a> is a tutorial on setting it up. This is what heavy Docker users will want to do.</p><h2>VirtualBox</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/virtualbox-c37e4cc82b13d3c1c080f7ced273ae45.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>VirtualBox won't work.</strong></p><p>VirtualBox is a <strong>hypervisor</strong>. Therefore, <strong>it won't be able to run x86 Windows or x86 Linux</strong>.</p><p>You could use VirtualBox to run ARM Windows. Windows already supports ARM, and has a similar binary translation system to Apple's, so it can run x86 binaries. However, VirtualBox only supports x86 hosts and guests and is <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=98742">unlikely to be ported by ARM</a>.</p><p>VMWare Fusion similarly is a hypervisor that only support x86, but <a href="https://twitter.com/VMwareFusion/status/1275483803536908288?s=20">they're thinking about supporting ARM</a>.</p><p>Instead of VirtualBox you might use QEMU, an emulator. However, QEMU is pretty low level and not often used to emulate Windows.</p><h2>Boot Camp</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/boot-camp-f05493e57b0fe815dbc1d989ada98dd0.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>Boot Camp won't work.</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.apple.com/boot-camp">Boot Camp</a> is an Apple-approved way to dual-boot Mac OS and Windows. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">Boot Camp will definitely not be available on ARM Macs</a>. It might be added later with the ability to run ARM Windows, though Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp">would have to approve</a>.</p><h2>Should I get an ARM Mac?</h2><p>The point of this post isn't to say that ARM Mac is a bad idea, but to give a realistic idea of what developing on one would look like assuming nothing changes. It's possible Apple could release more virtualization tools before the ARM Mac launches.</p><p>Should you get an ARM Mac if you're a developer? If you work largely on frontend, mobile, or native apps, you'll probably be fine. But if you use virtualization often, I wouldn't recommend it. There will be a lot of problems early on, and not all of them will have solutions. My biggest concern is getting an ARM Mac and realizing I simply can't run an essential application on it.</p><p>However if you like troubleshooting these issues and are excited about ARM Mac, go for it! My plan is for those kinds of people to fix these issues.</p><p>Know something I don't? Have questions? Email me at <a href="mailto:bmalehorn@gmail.com">bmalehorn@gmail.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

              <p>Gatsby is one of the most popular JavaScript static site generators available. While static sites offer excellent performance, they only store state locally in the user’s browser, so they can’t provide features like user authentication natively. If you want to add authentication to your Gatsby site, FusionAuth is an excellent solution.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In this blog post, you’ll learn how to create a Gatsby site that uses FusionAuth to allow users to log in and access their profile securely. This application will use an <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/oauth/definitive-guide-to-oauth-2#52-code-flow--pkce">OAuth Authorization Code workflow and the PKCE extension</a> to log users in and a Node application to store your access token securely. PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange, and is often pronounced “pixie”.</p>

<p>At a high level, the authorization process looks like this:</p>

      </figure>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll walk through the process step-by-step, but if you want to download the code, it is <a href="https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-gatsby">available on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-well-cover">What we’ll cover</h2>

  <li>Setting up FusionAuth</li>
  <li>Creating a new user</li>
  <li>Creating a Node proxy application</li>
  <li>Creating a Gatsby site</li>
  <li>Conclusion and next steps</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">FusionAuth</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node JS</a> (10+ preferred)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> package manager</li>
  <li>Web browser</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-fusionauth">Setting up FusionAuth</h2>
<p>Before you start writing any code, download FusionAuth and get it running on your local machine. FusionAuth is available <a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">for all major operating systems</a> or it can be <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker">run in Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have FusionAuth running, log into the admin panel and create a new Application. This process <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide">is outlined here</a>, but you’ll need to add your application’s URLs to the OAuth configuration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add <code>http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback</code> to the “Authorized redirect URLs”.</li>
  <li>Add <code>http://localhost:9000</code> to the “Authorized request origin URLs”.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>http://localhost:8000</code> in the “Logout URL” field.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also want to save the “Client Id” and “Client secret” values as you’ll need them later.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/application-setup.png" alt="FusionAuth configuration options for a Gatsby static site."></p>

<p>You’ll also need to create an API key. Go to “Settings”, then to “API Keys”. You may create one with adminstrative privileges for the purposes of this tutorial. For a production application, please follow the principle of least privilege and limit the endpoints available to the key. Save the API key off as you’ll need it later.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-user">Creating a new user</h2>
<p>To test your Gatsby-based login, you’ll need to add a new user and register them for your application in FusionAuth. From the Users page in FusionAuth, click “+” to add a user. Enter an email address and password for your new user and click the save button.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/create-user.png" alt="Creating a new user in FusionAuth."></p>

<p>Next, click “Add registration” to link this user to the application you created in Step 1. Click the save button when you’re finished.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/register-user.png" alt="Registering a user in FusionAuth."></p>

<p>Now that a user is registered for your application, you can start building the Node app.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-node-proxy-application">Creating a Node proxy application</h2>
<p>This project will use two separate applications: a Node app to securely store your access token and make calls to the FusionAuth API, and a Gatsby site to present information to the user. The Node app will have four endpoints:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/login</code> - Generates the FusionAuth login URL with a PKCE challenge</li>
  <li><code>/oauth-callback</code> - Trades the one-time authorization code and PKCE verifier for an access token which is added to session storage</li>
  <li><code>/user</code> - Uses the access token and the FusionAuth <code>introspect</code> endpoint to get information about the current user</li>
  <li><code>/logout</code> - Logs the user out and destroys the session</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll create all the endpoints first, and then you’ll see how to call them from Gatsby.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-node-app">Setting up the Node app</h3>
<p>Before you get started, you need to create a new subdirectory and initialize an Express app. Use a <a href="https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/03/10/securely-implement-oauth-in-react">similar structure to the one outlined here</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fusionauth-gatsby
├─gatsby
├─server
└─config.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your <code>config.js</code> file should contain all your FusionAuth information. Add the following to the file with your FusionAuth application’s ID, client ID, and ports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>module.exports = {
  // FusionAuth info (copied from the FusionAuth admin panel)
  clientID: '5eb76e67-c65e-474d-ba23-4cb61b0c8414',
  clientSecret: 'BVS1NIgID3HWE5U38HYSb4DOie3UbIySOsJKLT41WWg',
  redirectURI: 'http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback',
  applicationID: '5eb76e67-c65e-474d-ba23-4cb61b0c8414',

  // Your FusionAuth api key
  apiKey: 'skAHV4mOEhz2zYQcG_5l4BkhsCzmtYTU8VGOi8Y40zo',

  // Ports
  clientPort: 8000,
  serverPort: 9000,
  fusionAuthPort: 9011
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Within the <code>./server</code> directory, create a new <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app and install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">cors</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session">session</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> packages.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>npm init
<span># Complete all the questions as appropriate</span>
npm <span>install </span>express cors express-session request <span>--save</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, open up your <code>package.json</code> file and add a <code>"start"</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"start"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node index.js"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>//</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, create a new file in the <code>./server</code> directory called <code>index.js</code> that will initialize your Express app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>session</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express-session</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>cors</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>cors</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../config</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>// configure Express app and install the JSON middleware for parsing JSON bodies</span>
<span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>();</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>express</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>());</span>

<span>// configure sessions</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>session</span><span>(</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>secret</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1234567890</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>resave</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
    <span>saveUninitialized</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>

      <span>maxAge</span><span>:</span> <span>3600000</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>})</span>

<p>In the following sections, you’ll create the route files listed in the code above.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-login-route">Creating the login route</h3>
<p>To generate a login URL, your application will need to create a PKCE verifier and challenge. It will send the challenge to FusionAuth via query string parameters along with your client ID and a redirect URL.</p>

<p>Using PKCE adds an additional layer of security, as it is a one time use and guarantees that the Node application that generated the challenge is the same one that sent the verifier. Normally, PKCE is used where the client cannot keep a secret, such as a single page application.</p>

<p>To generate a <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE challenge and verifier</a>, you’ll need to use some of the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html">Node crypto functions</a>. Create a new folder in the <code>./server</code> directory called <code>helpers</code>. Add a new file called <code>pkce.js</code> to the folder. You will generate a verifier and challenge in this file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>function</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>base64</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>\/</span><span>/g</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>_</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/=/g</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>sha256</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>crypto</span><span>.</span><span>createHash</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>sha256</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>).</span><span>digest</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>generateVerifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>crypto</span><span>.</span><span>randomBytes</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>generateChallenge</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>verifier</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>sha256</span><span>(</span><span>verifier</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two exported functions, <code>generateVerifier</code> and <code>generateChallenge</code>, will be used in your login route to create a PKCE verifier. Create a new directory called <code>routes</code> in your <code>./server</code> directory and add a new file called <code>login.js</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span><span>();</span>
<span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../../config</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>pkce</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../helpers/pkce</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>verifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>pkce</span><span>.</span><span>generateVerifier</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Generate the PKCE challenge</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>challenge</span> <span>=</span> <span>pkce</span><span>.</span><span>generateChallenge</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>verifier</span><span>);</span>

  <span>// Redirect the user to log in via FusionAuth</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>redirect</span><span>(</span><span>`http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>fusionAuthPort</span><span>}</span><span>/oauth2/authorize?`</span><span>+</span>
    <span>`client_id=</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>clientID</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;redirect_uri=</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>redirectURI</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;response_type=code`</span><span>+</span>
    <span>`&amp;code_challenge=</span><span>${</span><span>challenge</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;code_challenge_method=S256`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>router</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when users visit <code>localhost:9000/login</code> the Node app will generate a PKCE verifier and challenge, save the verifier to session storage, and redirect the user to FusionAuth with the challenge in the URL. The FusionAuth app will store this challenge and make sure that the verifier sent in the OAuth callback is valid.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-oauth-callback">Creating the OAuth callback</h3>
<p>Once the user has entered their username and password, the FusionAuth server will check their credentials and redirect them to your Node app’s OAuth callback endpoint with an authorization code. Your app will use that code and the PKCE verifier generated in the previous step to request a <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/tokens">long-lived access token</a>.</p>

<p>Again, adding PKCE adds another layer of security by proving that the entity which sent the challenge is now requesting an access token. Your Node app will store the access token returned by FusionAuth in session storage and redirect the user to the Gatsby profile page we’ll create in the next step.</p>

<p>Create a new route called <code>oauth-callback.js</code> and add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I get it. Now, as you manage multiple individuals or teams, it feels like you spend most of your time in meetings or preparing for meetings. You miss the times when you sometimes had entire days to yourself to work on a project heads down. While those days will never return, you can make changes to the way you operate to maximize the time you spend freely.</p><p>But how? Glad you asked. This article contains small tips and practices that I’ve been following for years and helped me regain some of my time. I hope you can put some of these to work too!</p><h2 id="It-all-starts-with-your-calendar"><a href="#It-all-starts-with-your-calendar" title="It all starts with your calendar"></a>It all starts with your calendar</h2><p>How does your Monday morning look like? Mine goes something like this: after my morning espresso (which I perfected on a Rancilio Silvia machine), I take a look at my calendar to understand better what the week ahead holds for me. By looking at each meeting, I try to answer the following questions. Is this a meeting that I must attend? Does it have a clear agenda? Historically, was this meeting useful to me, or can I contribute to the success of this meeting? Based on these questions’ answers, I either RSVP with a No, ask for an agenda or start figuring out how to best prepare. By doing this every Monday, you not only save time for yourself for the week by declining meetings you don’t need to attend, but it also helps you better prioritize what you need to do during the week.</p><p>A tool I found especially useful for my calendar is Clockwise- it helps you to block time (and move meetings around!) on your calendar to create focus time for you and your team.</p><h2 id="Speaking-of-meetings"><a href="#Speaking-of-meetings" title="Speaking of meetings"></a>Speaking of meetings</h2><p>In my book, there shouldn’t be any meetings scheduled without a clear agenda. If there isn’t a clear agenda, attendees won’t know what we want to get out of a session.</p><p>Like most people, I love it when a meeting wraps up early, giving everyone time back. This is one of the reasons I believe meetings should always have an agenda - if we met our goals, everyone could go back to their daily routine.</p><p>With that said, I believe it’s perfectly fine for meetings to go off-topic for some time. It helps team members to gossip and, and through that, to build better work relationships. At the same time, it’s the organizer’s responsibility to jump in if it goes on for too long to make sure that we are back on track with agenda items.</p><h2 id="Delegate-delegate-and-delegate-some-more"><a href="#Delegate-delegate-and-delegate-some-more" title="Delegate, delegate and delegate some more"></a>Delegate, delegate and delegate some more</h2><p>Delegation is the process of scaling yourself horizontally. While it requires some upfront investment on your end, like helping individuals build the skills to be successful in the project you delegate to them, it saves you time in the long term.</p><p>Delegation doesn’t only save you time, but more importantly, this is how you grow talent within your company.</p><h2 id="Notify-me-about…"><a href="#Notify-me-about…" title="Notify me about…"></a>Notify me about…</h2><p>While Slack messages may seem urgent, they are usually not. Because of this, I prefer consuming Slack by pulling messages, instead of jumping on every single notification. I disable notifications for most things on Slack, and every once in a while, I go through all the Slack rooms that need my attention. At the same time, I try to be responsive to direct messages during working hours.</p><p>Don’t take me wrong, I am not picking on Slack - I follow the same principles for all the applications I use regularly, like mail clients or Twitter.</p><p>Oh, and no notifications on mobile. Ever.</p><h2 id="Have-you-tried-automating-that"><a href="#Have-you-tried-automating-that" title="Have you tried automating that?"></a>Have you tried automating that?</h2><p>Whenever I start doing a new activity, for the first few times, I do it manually. Once I have a good grasp of what the work is, I work on automating it, so I never have to do it again. Even if you only save 15 minutes weekly, that’s almost two working days annually.</p><p>A more recent example of this was when a team I manage started collecting adoption metrics. Initially, I’ve done it manually, recording all the metrics we were interested in in a spreadsheet. After a couple of times, I wrote a simple Node.js script to collect the same metrics and the script creates CSVs that only takes a few seconds to import to the spreadsheet I created previously.</p><p>When applicable, take it a step further and delegate: ask someone from your team to take ownership of the automation to gain experience from building on it.</p><hr><h2 id="Your-turn"><a href="#Your-turn" title="Your turn"></a>Your turn</h2><p>I’d love to hear from you - what practices you follow to make sure you are your most efficient self? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below!</p></div></div>]]>

A few organizations have even experienced a permanent move towards work from home (WFH) practices. While many are satisfied with the change for different reasons, others can’t seem to wait to get back to the way that work used to be. At this time, employers have to contend to the short and long-term ramifications of new working conditions and its impacts to productivity, communication, culture, cybersecurity and several other issues that have emerged as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As considerations are made, organizations will need to take a holistic approach to ensure a successful transition to a new normal. Below are some of the key areas that leadership has to work with as it builds and implements a return to the office plan.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="4a9e017" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Legal &amp; Regulatory Compliance</h2></p></div><div data-id="3019c57" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been multiple public authorities at the federal, state/ provincial and municipal levels that have enacted policies to curb the spread of the pandemic and support all pillars of society. As usual, it falls onto the laps of leadership to ensure that their organization remains in compliance with said laws.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the legal environment changes internationally and nationally, organizations have to consider the legal and financial implications of adopting and complying to new policies. Further deliberation regarding the safety of the workforce need to be taken into account. At this time, companies need to be proactive by revisiting internal policies such as Health and Safety policies, WFH policies, Code of Conduct policies, and Cybersecurity policies. As such, it is essential that senior executives work in tandem with officers on the ground to understand the current atmosphere of their organization, its impact on policies and expectations, as well as ensure that enacted policies reach their desired outcomes.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="7c67953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="360" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></p></div></div><div data-id="651f2b8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Sanitary and Hygiene Practices</h2></p></div><div data-id="24e74cd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an office environment, organizations have to consider how and whether to shoulder the costs of PPE supplies and training for its employees and customers. If that is not an option, leaders have to contend with personally owned PPE which may be inadequate or non-existent. This may pose unintended consequences that may challenge return to the office efforts and increase customer and employee exposure, potentially leading to disruptions in operations. (<span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/technology/amazon-coronavirus-workers.html">‘Way Too Late’: Inside Amazon’s Biggest Outbreak</a></span>, NY Times).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good personal hygiene such as hand washing and social distancing remains a major part of the fight against COVID-19. To ensure good office practices and training, well positioned pamphlets, workshops, adequate infrastructure, supporting policies, and a culture of cleanliness are just a few of the major drivers of change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office cleanliness will remain a priority to both the organization and employees. Even if it is believed that employees are following sanitary and hygiene practices, the organization will likely need to increase the rate of commercial cleaning services throughout its establishment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a pandemic environment, sanitary and hygiene practices are not isolated factors that are bound to stay within the secrecy of a company. For example, a <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-in-germany-meat-packing-plant-covid-19-outbreak-cases-r-reproduction-rate-up-today-2020-06-22/">single meat packing plant in Germany</a></span> is believed to be behind over 1,000 confirmed cases. Even in optimal conditions, outbreaks of this nature can have a direct impact on society, economic recovery, organizational operations and even raise risks to brand value.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b6a4e69" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Shared Space and Common Area Policies</h2></p></div><div data-id="6fae723" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the pandemic, many organizations have moved their offices to shared work spaces and common areas within offices such as water coolers, cafeteria or entertainment rooms, were seen as standard infrastructure. Nowadays, there are concerns that these areas will often involve interactions in close proximity, which can further exacerbate pandemic related risks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lower said risks, organizations need to consider implementing physical distancing and hygiene measures and protocols. At this time, many governmental bodies have stipulated guidelines that can be used to support organizational procedures and help organizations navigate through the reopening of their workplace. The <span><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">State of California</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-businesses-and-facilities.page">New York City</a></span>, and the <span><a href="https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-protect-yourself-others/community-settings-workplaces/">City of Toronto</a></span> are just a few examples of such guidelines being extended to organizations. It is important to follow local guidelines, but whenever possible, borrow additional innovative takes from other jurisdictions.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="776149d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Back to the Office Employee Prioritization</h2></p></div><div data-id="16083af" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teams or roles that demand a higher amount of physical interaction and can’t perform their duties well via online means should be considered as front-runners of back to the office policies. Simultaneously, leaders should critically assess if individuals whose roles are well suited for remote working, should only make the return to the office at the later phase of the pandemic reopening. Such efforts can help reduce health risks to employees and customers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IT department for example, may return back to the office on a rotational basis or in batches (team by team). Employees involved in the preparation and maintenance of physical technology (e.g. servers and hardware support) are likely to be prioritized while most of the software cast may be held back to later phases since their work may be accomplished remotely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As leadership determines how to prioritize the return to the office, there are a few questions that should always be asked:</p><ul><li>Are there feasible technological or procedural options that can be taken to limit X role’s exposure? If so, would their work be impacted and how?</li><li>How big of a priority would it be to bring certain individuals back to the office under these circumstances?</li><li>Would the solution help potential future disruptions such as a 2<sup>nd</sup> COVID-19 wave?”</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="94b69f1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting rooms can follow similar protocols stipulated to shared spaces and common areas, given the limited square footage that such spaces traditionally have which can make it harder to enforce distancing rules and lead to an <span><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-evidence-to-support-the-2-metre-social-distancing-rule-to-reduce-covid-19-transmission/">increased risk of transmission</a></span>. In said cases, organizations may benefit from setting a threshold on the number of employees permitted per meeting and the distances that are expected. Office administrators may want to set delimitators such as a sign to stipulate social distancing and remove excess chairs to help set the precedent. Reminder mechanisms such as pamphlets to clean spaces before and once they have been used can also beneficial.</p></div></div><div data-id="40674cf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Rotational Work Schedules</h2></p></div><div data-id="0e4000c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To diminish contact, some organizations may benefit from building rotational work schedules where a department or group alternates every couple of weeks. This can help set better social distancing in offices that do not have the capacity to handle prior numbers of employees and clients. Some organizations have already started a two week in office and off office rotation, in which the workforce is divided into 2 groups (or more) which rotate the office space – as seen in the case of <span><a href="https://webstercity.com/2020/03/24/city-staff-to-rotate-on-shifts-in-response-to-covid-19/">Webster City</a></span>, Iowa.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also allows teams to regain some of the interactions and experience that the office can provide while still having work from home flexibility. Organizations may find this to be the right mix of home comfort and office experience. Once COVID-19 related issues subside, organizations may find further operational efficiency in having a mixed policy, allowing it to move into smaller offices with lower costs.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="4111b59" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="360" height="240" src="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 1080w" data-sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></p></div></div><div data-id="547cd1e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, most offices are not set-up to accommodate for COVID-19 related concerns such as social distancing. As organization decide when and who may return to the office, considerations over closed workspace, socially distanced offices, signs, contactless technology can be major drivers in helping leaders implement an employee first and health-driven culture.</p></div></div><div data-id="c8cf2f0" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pandemic has shown that family and individuals can be impacted differently. To ensure a smooth transition back to the office, organizations may benefit from having structure, policies and procedures to handle exceptions. For instance, employees with children or elderly parents at home may have a difficult time procuring the necessary resources to support their needs. At times like these, the organization may benefit from giving the employee an extended work from home period where viable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clients may also prefer to have the option to attend meetings and consultations online. There is a fine balance between organizational, employee, and customer needs. Considerations over the complexity of exception handling should also be taken into account. Critical assessment of said implications and needs can help improve employee and customer satisfaction in the short run while also providing much needed experience on how to handle operational challenges that are bound to occur (crisis handling).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="8c003e6" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Clear, Open and Continuous Communication</h2></p></div><div data-id="5470e56" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In periods with trials and tribulations, society looks for leaders to guide them through rough patches. For an organization, employees and customers are actively looking for cues to understand its trajectory and how it will impact them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, discrepancies in individual habits in relation to work from home and back to office may be front-center in a manager’s mind. Whether it is employee tardiness, commute, productivity, organizational networks and others, readjustment will take time and requires guidance. For that to happen, leaders will need to maintain a transparent, open and continuous communication to help clarify and facilitate solutions for issues that arise.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="ab5c68a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transitional periods can be challenging to many and will often lead to resistances. To ensure a smooth transition back to the office, it is important to note the origins of said challenges.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>BLEU is a standard algorithm for evaluating the machine translations against the human translations. At first I thought it should be very straightforward to use. However, it turns out that there are a lot of caveats.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to show the BLEU algorithm in detail and talk about the caveats.</p>

<h3 id="english-translation-example">English Translation Example</h3>

<p>We will use the following examples to illustrate how to compute the BLEU scores.</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the cat the cat on the mat</p>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the the the the the the the the</p>

<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>

<p>We count each of the ngram in the candidate sentence whether it has shown in any of the reference sentences, gather the total counts for each of the unique ngram, sum up the total counts for each of the unique ngram, and divided by the number of ngrams in the candidate sentence.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>We first compute the unigram precision for example 1. All the unigrams in the candidate sentences have shown in the reference sentences.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the unigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Unigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7. The unigram precision is 7/7 = 1.0 for example 1.</p>



<p>We then try to compute the bigram precision for example 1.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Bigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat the</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the bigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Bigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat the</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>

<h4 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h4>

<p>We can see from example 1 and 2 that unigram precision is very easy to be over-confident about the quality of the machine translation. To overcome this, clipped count and modified precision were proposed.</p>

<h3 id="modified-precision">Modified Precision</h3>

<p>For each unique ngram, we count its maximum frequency in each of the reference sentences. The minimum of this special count and the original count is called the clipped the count. That is to say, the clipped count is no greater than the original count. We then use this clipped count, in place of the original count, for computing the modified precision.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<p>Compared to precision, we found that modified precision is a better metric, at least for unigrams.</p>

<h3 id="bleu">BLEU</h3>

<h4 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h4>

<p>BLEU is computed using a couple of ngram modified precisions. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $p_n$ is the modified precision for $n$gram, the base of $\log$ is the natural base $e$, $w_n$ is weight between 0 and 1 for $\log p_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n = 1$, and BP is the brevity penalty to penalize short machine translations.</p>



<p>where $c$ is the number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus. Here the best match length is the closest reference sentence length to the candidate sentences. For example, if there are three references with lengths 12, 14, and 17 words and the candidate translation is a terse 13 words, ideally the best match length could be either 12 or 14, but we arbitrary choose the shorter one which is 12.</p>



<p>Usually, the BLEU is evaluated on corpus where there are many candidate sentences translated from different source texts and each of them has several reference sentences. Then $c$ is the total number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the sum of the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus.</p>



<p>It is not hard to find that BLEU is always a value between 0 and 1. It is because BP, $w_n$, and $p_n$ are always between 0 and 1, and</p>



<p>Usually, BLEU uses $N = 4$ and $w_n = \frac{1}{N}$.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-3">Example 1</h4>

<p>We have computed the modified precision for some of the ngrams. It is not hard to compute the others. Concretely, we have</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 7$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>We plugin these values to the BLEU equation, the BLEU is</p>



<p>We further compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.467 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-3">Example 2</h4>

<p>Similarly,</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 8$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>When we plugin these values to the BLEU equation, actually we would need to compute $\log 0$ which is not mathematically defined. We use a small number $10^{-100}$ instead of $0$ for $p_2$, $p_3$ and $p_4$. The BLEU is</p>



<p>We further also compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<span>1.2882297539194154e-231</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<p>Note that in the above two examples, due to the candidate sentence is long and we only have one translation in the corpus, thus $\text{BP} = 1$. In practice, there could be scenarios where $\text{BP} &lt; 1$.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In some scenarios, BLEU does not score the translation very well, especially for those short translations with few reference sentences. For example,</p>



<p>Chinese: 你准备好了吗？</p>

<p>Reference 1: are you ready ?</p>

<p>Candidate: you are ready ?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>

<span>1.133422688662942e-154</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is actually a very good machine translation to me. However, the BLEU score is 0, which means that the machine translation is totally wrong.</p>



<p>In NLTK, you are allowed to provide <a href="https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.translate.html#nltk.translate.bleu_score.SmoothingFunction">smoothing functions</a>. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>reference_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"are you ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"you are ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>bleu</span> <span>=</span> <span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>sentence_bleu</span><span>(</span><span>references</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>reference_1</span><span>],</span> <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>candidate</span><span>,</span> <span>weights</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>],</span> <span>smoothing_function</span><span>=</span><span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>SmoothingFunction</span><span>().</span><span>method7</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>bleu</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4002926439114545</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, the value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.4, which is magically higher than the vanilla one we computed without using smoothing functions.</p>



<p>However, one should be always cautious about the smoothing function used in BLEU computation. At least we have to make sure that the BLEU scores we are comparing against are using no smoothing function or the exact same smoothing function.</p>

By using accessibility features in your app, you’re allowing your app to reach a wider audience.</p><p id="d948">Sticking with their commitment to accessibility, Apple has introduced several new features at WWDC20 which help developers make their apps easier and more entertaining for users with disabilities. By making apps more accessible, developers eliminate the need for users to purchase clunky, expensive devices in order to use their apps — everything they need to interact with the app is built right into the device.</p><p id="df0d">In this article, you’ll learn about some of the biggest and best upgrades to accessibility, announced at this year’s WWDC.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="ecb9">The first on the list is an interesting feature — which didn’t get talked about on stage. As the name suggests, Back Tap allows users to set single, double, or triple taps on the back of their iPhones and link them to certain tasks. For example, you could double tap on the back of your iPhone to open the weather app.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg?q=20" width="1200" height="732" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg" width="1200" height="732" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Setting up Back Tap on iOS 14.</figcaption></figure><p id="91c1">And since the tapping feature can be linked to Shortcuts, it opens up a whole range of possibilities with home automation and more! As seen in the example above, you could triple tap the back of your phone to quickly take notes, or you could use it to unlock your door when you’re about to enter the house. Easy, right?</p><p id="563c">For users with hearing impairments, Apple has added the ability to adjust sound frequencies on supported headphones. By doing this, users can now set their own preferences on what they want to hear more of and what they want to hear less of.</p><p id="dc81">The new feature also comes with pre-set profiles for specific outdoor situations, in case the user doesn’t want to manually configure the sound frequencies.</p><blockquote><p id="dba7">This new accessibility feature is designed to amplify soft sounds and adjust certain frequencies for an individual’s hearing, to help music, movies, phone calls, and podcasts sound more crisp and clear. Headphone Accommodations also supports Transparency mode on AirPods Pro, making quiet voices more audible and tuning the sounds of your environment to your hearing needs.</p><p id="8aab">— Apple Documentation</p></blockquote><p id="6a9f">Further, the new feature also supports Transparency Mode on AirPods Pro, which allows users to adjust how much of the surroundings they want to hear. If they want to amplify soft voices or listen to the environment in more detail, they now have that autonomy.</p><p id="d5d2">In the same vein, a new feature called <strong>Sound Recognition</strong> can pick up important sounds in the environment, such as Sirens, Fire Alarms, or Car Horns and alert the user of them. Through machine learning models built into the operating system, these sounds can be picked up and transmitted to the user in any way that they wish.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png?q=20" width="700" height="1110" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png" width="700" height="1110" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Real-Time Text on the iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bf5">Group FaceTime calls have become more important than ever during the global pandemic, and Apple has added a small but important accessibility feature to them. Now, if a member of a group FaceTime call is using sign language to communicate, their video will be automatically pinned.</p><p id="ab6c">Using computer vision to detect this can be a boon to those with hearing loss, since reading sign language while the screen is moving around can be frustrating.</p><p id="43b4">In addition to this, Apple has made further improvements to its Real-Time Text feature, which is used for text based communication during phone calls. Previously, it was difficult for RTT users to multitask during phone calls, but it no longer requires the full screen.</p><p id="0458">When we think of accessibility on iOS, VoiceOver is often the first to come to mind. This year, VoiceOver received several significant updates, making it even more useful than before.

June 25, 2020 | https://tomerv.github.io/posts/food-ingredients/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomerv.github.io/posts/food-ingredients/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="food-ingredients-as-linear-programming">

<p>I like to know what I’m eating – even if it’s junk – so I often find myself looking at the ingredients list on the label.</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/chocolates.jpg"><img alt="Life is like a box of chocolates" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/chocolates.jpg"></a></p><p>I got a package of choclates had this list of ingredients:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Milk chocolate (58%), nougat (40%), milk fat, coffee extract (0.1%)</p>
<p>—<em>A box of chocolates</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>How helpful of them to write the percentages for each ingredient! But wait, they put percentage only for the “good” ingredients, but not for the milk fat (what does that even mean?). No matter, I know how to subtract <a href="#f1" id="id1">1</a>:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\mbox{chocolate} + \mbox{nougat} + \mbox{fat} + \mbox{coffee} &amp;= 100\% \\
58\% + 40\% + \mbox{fat} + 0.1\% &amp;= 100\% \\
\mbox{fat} &amp;= 100\% - 58\% - 40\% - 0.1\% \\
\mbox{fat} &amp;= 1.9\%\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Cool, we deduced some information that wasn’t given to us directly!</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/noodles.jpg"><img alt="&quot;Professional&quot; noodles" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/noodles.jpg"></a></p><p>Let’s try it again, this time on a package of pre-cooked noodles:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Wheat flour, water, eggs (2%), salt, turmeric</p>
<p>—<em>A package of noodles</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This one is a bit trickier. We know that</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\mbox{flour} + \mbox{water} + \mbox{eggs} + \mbox{salt} + \mbox{turmeric} &amp;= 100\% \\
\mbox{flour} + \mbox{water} + 2\% + \mbox{salt} + \mbox{turmeric} &amp;= 100\% \\
\mbox{flour} + \mbox{water} + \mbox{salt} + \mbox{turmeric} &amp;= 98\%\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Seems we’re kind of stuck here…</p>
<p>But maybe we can still do something with this. Food regulations require that the ingredients be listed in a particular order <a href="#f2" id="id2">2</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The food components shall be listed in descending order according to their relative content
in the weight of the product, from the largest content to the smallest content.</p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.health.gov.il/English/Topics/FoodAndNutrition/Nutrition/Adequate_nutrition/Pages/labeling.aspx">Ministry of Health</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Using this information we also know that</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\mbox{flour} \geq \mbox{water} \geq \mbox{eggs} \geq \mbox{salt} \geq \mbox{turmeric} &amp;\geq 0 \\
\mbox{flour} \geq \mbox{water} \geq 2\% \geq \mbox{salt} \geq \mbox{turmeric} &amp;\geq 0\end{split}\]</p>
<p>From all of the above we can deduce that <span>\(47\% \leq \mbox{flour} \leq 96\%\)</span> and <span>\(2\% \leq \mbox{water} \leq 49\%\)</span> which is… nice to know, I guess?</p>
<p>I could go over the steps for deducing the wheat content in our noodles, but instead let’s jump to the general case.</p>
<div id="the-shortest-intro-to-linear-programming-lp">
<h2>The Shortest Intro to Linear Programming (LP)<a href="#the-shortest-intro-to-linear-programming-lp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have to admit that the name is confusing. This sounds like some kind of programming technique, but it is more of an algorithm, or a group of algorithms that solve the same problem. To its defense, it was invented before current-day programming. I guess you could say that it started out as a programming technique.</p>
<p>The gist of LP is that if we format our problem as a <cite>linear optimization problem</cite>, we can use known algorithms to solve it. We don’t even need to implement these algorithms, there are many LP solvers freely available. Here we’ll use SciPy’s <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html">optimize.linprog</a>, so we’ll work with its input format:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\min_x \ &amp; c^T x \\
\mbox{such that} \ &amp; A_{ub} x \leq b_{ub},\\
&amp; A_{eq} x = b_{eq},\\
&amp; l \leq x \leq u ,\end{split}\]</p>
<p>where <span>\(x\)</span> is a vector of decision variables; <span>\(c\)</span>,
<span>\(b_{ub}\)</span>, <span>\(b_{eq}\)</span>, <span>\(l\)</span>, and <span>\(u\)</span> are vectors; and
<span>\(A_{ub}\)</span> and <span>\(A_{eq}\)</span> are matrices.</p>
<p>The term <span>\(c^T x\)</span> is the <cite>cost</cite>, and the inequalities below it are the <cite>constraints</cite>. Our LP solver finds <span>\(x\)</span> that minimizes the cost while satisfying all the constraints.</p>
<p>In a way, this is a bit like programming, but instead of source code we have matrices, and instead of a compiler we have an LP solver.</p>
<p>Let’s work towards getting our problem into the correct form.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-to-an-lp-form">
<h2>Getting to an LP Form<a href="#getting-to-an-lp-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, let’s go over the rules of our game:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The amounts are sorted from largest to smallest</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of all the amounts is 1.0 (that’s our 100%, meaning all the ingredients are listed)</p></li>
<li><p>All the amounts are positive</p></li>
<li><p>Some amounts are known</p></li>
<li><p>For the amounts we don’t know, we would like to get an upper and lower bound</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll denote the amounts by the vector <span>\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first rule says that <span>\(x_1 &gt;= x_2 &gt;= \cdots &gt;= x_{n-1} &gt;= x_{n}\)</span>. Is this a linear relation? We need to bring it into the form <span>\(A_{ub} x &lt;= b_{ub}\)</span>, which means changing it into vector notation where all the unknowns to the left-hand side of the inequality. We use <span>\(e_i\)</span> to denote the vector that has 1 in the <span>\(i\)</span> th position, and 0 elsewhere.</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}x_i \geq x_{i+1} \\
- x_i + x_{i+1} \leq 0 \\
- e_i x + e_{i+1} x \leq 0 \\
(- e_i + e_{i+1}) x \leq 0\end{split}\]</p>
<p>This applies for <span>\(i=1..n-1\)</span>. For <span>\(n=5\)</span> as in our noodles example, the result looks like this <a href="#f3" id="id3">3</a>:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
x_5
\end{pmatrix}
\leq
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Moving on to the second rule, and things are only getting easier. The sum of all the amounts is an obvious linear relation:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
x_5
\end{pmatrix}
=
1\end{split}\]</p>
<p>This is the first row of our <span>\(A_{eq} x = b_{eq}\)</span> relationship. We need to add more rows to <span>\(A_{eq}\)</span>, and we’ll come back to it a bit later.</p>
<p>Next, all the amounts are positive. This sounds trivial, but it’s important. Without it we can barely deduce anything, and we would get wrong answers. We could model this in a matrix relation, but that’s not needed. The SciPy implementation has support for lower and upper bounds. We just set <span>\(l = 0, u = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now for the known amounts. Even easier, this one. If <span>\(x_i\)</span> is known to be equal to <span>\(v_i\)</span>, then we have</p>
<p>
\[e_i x_i = v_i\]</p>
<p>We take all these, and the equation for the sum of the values, and put them all in a single matrix (each equation is a row). For our noodles example, we have a row for the some of all the amounts, and a row for the known amount for <span>\(x_3\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
x_5
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0.02
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to find out the maximal and minimal possible amounts for one of the ingredients. If we’re interested in the minimal amount for ingredient <span>\(i\)</span>, we want to</p>
<p>
\[\mbox{minimize } e_i x\]</p>
<p>And if we want to find the maximal amount for it,</p>
<p>
\[\mbox{minimize } (-e_i) x\]</p>
<p>That’s it! Let’s put all that into code, and let SciPy do the hard work of actually solving it.</p>
</div>
<div id="coding-the-lp">
<h2>Coding the LP<a href="#coding-the-lp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/tomerv/food-ingredients">here</a>. It’s not that interesting, so I won’t go into it.</p>
<p>The implementation uses NumPy matrices. I tried sparse matrices as well, but it was slower. This is probably due to the small size of the matrix, usually no larger than 10x10. For these sizes, the overhead of using a sparse matrix is larger than the savings.</p>
<p>I also wanted to give it a simple GUI to make it easier to use. I put it in a Jupyter Notebook with some input widgets for the names and values of the ingredients. It has a nicer interface, but it’s less flexible. You can run it <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tomerv/food-ingredients/master?filepath=src%2Fmain.ipynb">on mybinder.org</a>.</p>
<p>We can see check that the code give correct bounds for our noodles:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ python src/main.py data/noodles.txt
wheat flour:          47.00% - 96.00%
water:                 2.00% - 49.00%
eggs:                       2.00%
salt:                  0.00% -  2.00%
turmeric:              0.00% -  2.00%
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can also try it out on some other real foods sold in the supermarket in Israel.</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/nutella.jpg"><img alt="A jar of Nutella" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/nutella.jpg"></a></p><p>Here is Nutella:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ python src/main.py data/nutella.txt

flavorings:            0.00% -  7.40%
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The label emphasizes the hazelnut, milk, and cocoa content. But we still got non-trivial lower and upper bounds on the sugar content. I wonder how much sugar it really has…</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/quadratini.jpg"><img alt="A package of Quadritini" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/quadratini.jpg"></a></p><p>Still in the candy section, we have Quadratini:</p>

</div>
<p>Lots of ingredients here, and we’re only given quantities to a few of them. But we can still deduce a minimal amount of 12.4% coconut oil!</p>
<p>I tried many items. Some give interesting results, and some don’t. You’re welcome to try on your own.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Linear Programming is one of those things I encountered many times (including in 3 different university courses!) but never had a chance to apply.  New I can consider that task as “done”. I got to use scipy’s LP solver, tried out sparse matrices, and played a bit with Jupyter widgets.</p>
<p>As for the results, the most interesting cases are when a “bad” ingredient is first and the “good” ingredient has a low amount, like in the case of Nutella. This combination gives us a non-trivial lower bound for the bad ingredient.</p>
<p>Lastly, if I had to change one rule for the label on the packaging, I would force all manufacturers to give exact amounts for every ingredient that’s over 1%. It would make my code useless, but it would make consumers’ life better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>This is a collection of random thoughts regarding the application of
permacultural ideas to the computer world.</p>

<p>Some have tried to connect these worlds before (<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PermaCulture">WikiWikiWeb's Permaculture
article</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent
Beck</a>'s short-lived idea of <a href="https://www.softwarequotes.com/showquotes.aspx?id=559&amp;name=Kent%20Beck">Permaprogramming</a>),
but these have mostly concentrated on enhancing software engineering
practices with some ideas from gardening. I am more interested in the aspect
of cultural and ecological permanence. That is, how to give computers a
meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a
meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere.</p>

<h2>1. Problem</h2>

<p>Over the last few hundred years of human civilization, there has been a
dramatic increase in the consumption of artificially produced energy. In the
overarching story, this is often equated with "progress".</p>

<p>In the computer world, this phenomenon gets multiplied by itself:
"progress" facilitates ever greater densities of data storage and digital
logic, thus dramatically exploding the availability of computing resources.
However, the abundance has also caused an equivalent explosion in
wastefulness, which shows in things like mindblowingly ridiculous hardware
requirements for even quite trivial tasks.</p>

<p>At the same time, computers have been failing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">utopian
expectations</a>. Instead of amplifying the users' intelligence, they rather
amplify their stupidity. Instead of making it possible to scale down the
resource requirements of the material world, they have instead become a
major part of the problem. Instead of making the world more comprehensible,
they rather add to its incomprehensibility. And they often even manage to
become slower despite becoming faster.</p>

<p>In both computing and agriculture, a major issue is that problems are too
often "solved" by increasing controllability and resource use. Permaculture
takes another way, advocating methods that "let nature do the work" and thus
minimize the dependence on artificial energy input. Localness and
decentralization are also major themes in the thought.</p>

<p>What makes permacultural philosophy particularly appealing (to me) is
that it does not advocate "going back in time" despite advocating a dramatic
decrease in use of artificial energy. Instead, it trusts in human ingenunity
in finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition
into co-operation, waste into resources. Very much the same kind of creative
thinking I appreciate in computer hacking.</p>

<p>The presence of intelligent life in an ecosystem can be justified by its
strengthening effect. Ideally, humans could make ecosystems more flexible
and more resilient because of their ability to take leaps that are difficult
or impossible for "unintelligent" natural processes. The existence of
computers in a human civilization can be justified by their ability to
augment this potential.</p>

<h2>2. Physical resources</h2>

<h3>2.1. Energy</h3>

<p>Permaculture emphasizes resource-sensitivity. Computers primarily use
electricity, so to them resource-sensitivity primarily means 1) adapting to
changes in energy conditions and 2) using the available energy wisely.
Today's computers, even mobile ones, are surprisingly bad at this. This is
partially due to their legacy as "calculation factories" that are constantly
guaranteed all the resources they "need".</p>

<p>Intense non-urgent computation (such as long machine learning batches)
would take place only when a lot of surplus energy is being produced or
there is a need for electricity-to-heat conversion. This requires that the
computer is aware of the state of the surrounding energy system.</p>

<p>At times of low energy, both hardware and software would prefer to scale
down: background processes would freeze, user interfaces would become more
rudimentary, clock frequencies would decrease, unneeded processors and
memory banks would power off. At these times, people would prefer to do
something else than interact with computers.</p>

<p>It is often wise to store energy for later use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">Flywheels</a>
are a potential alternative to chemical batteries. They have similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy densities</a>
(MJ/kg) but require no rare-earth materials and last for decades or
centuries instead of mere years.</p>

<h3>2.2. Silicon</h3>

<p>IC fabrication requires large amounts of energy, highly refined machinery
and poisonous substances. Because of this sacrifice, the resulting
microchips should be treasured like gems or rare exotic spices. Their active
lifespans would be maximized, and they would never be reduced to their raw
materials until they are thoroughly unusable.</p>

<p>Instead of planned obsolescence, there should be planned longevity.</p>

<p>Broken devices would be repaired. If the community needs a kind of device
that does not exist, it should preferrably be built from existing components
that have fallen out of use. Chips should be designed open and flexible, so
that they can be reappropriated even for purposes they were never intended
for.</p>

<p>Complex chips should have enough redundancy and bypass mechanisms to keep
them working even after some of their internals wear out. (In a multicore
CPU, for instance, many partially functioning cores could combine into one
fully functioning one.)</p>

<p>Chips that work but whose practical use cannot be justified can find
artistic and other psychologically meaningful use. They may also be stored
away until they are needed again (especially if the fabrication quality and
the storage conditions allow for decades or centuries of "shelf life").</p>

<p>Use what is available. Even chips that do "evil" things are worth
considering if there's a landfill full of them. Crack their DRM locks,
reverse-engineer their black boxes, deconstruct their philosophies. It might
even be possible to reappropriate something like Bitcoin-mining ASICs for
something artistically interesting or even useful.</p>

<p>Minimized on-chip feature size makes it possible to do more computation
with less energy but it often also means increased fragility and shorter
lifespans. Therefore, the densest chips should be primarily used for
purposes where more computation actually yields more. (In entertainment use,
for example, a large use of resources is nothing more than a decadent
esthetic preference.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing">Alternatives
to semiconductors</a> should be actively researched. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328395242_Towards_fungal_computer">Living
cells</a> might be able to replace microchips in some tasks sometime in the
future.</p>

<p>Once perfectly clean ways of producing microchip equivalents have been
taken to use, the need for "junk fetishism" will probably diminish.</p>

<h3>2.3. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Whenever bright external light is available, displays should be able to
use it instead of competing against it with their own backlight. (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transflective_liquid-crystal_display">Transflective
LCD</a>)</p>

<p>Personally-owned computers are primarily for those who dedicate
themselves to the technology and thus spend considerable amounts of time
with it. Most other people would be perfectly happy with shared hardware.
Even if the culture and society embraced computers more than anything else,
requiring everyone to own one would be an overkill.</p>

<h2>3. Observation and interaction</h2>

<p>The first item in many lists of permacultural principles is "Observe and
interact." I interpret this as primarily referring to a bidirectional and
co-operative relationship with natural systems: you should not expect your
garden to be easily top-down controllable like an army unit but accept its
quirkiness and adapt to it.</p><h3>3.1. Observation</h3>

<p>Observation is among the most important human skills computers can augment.
Things that are difficult or impossible for humans to observe can be brought
within human cognitive capacity by various computational processes. Gathered
information can be visualized, slight changes and pattern deviances
emphasized, slow processes sped up, forecasts calculated. In Bill Mollison's
words, "Information is <em>the</em> critical potential resource. It becomes
a resource only when obtained and acted upon."</p>

<p>Computer systems should also make their own inner workings as observable as
possible. If the computer produces visual output, it would use a fraction of
its resources to visualize its own intro- and extrospection. A computer that
communicates with radio waves, for example, would visualize its own view of
the surrounding radio landscape.</p>

<p>Current consumer-oriented computing systems often go to ridiculous
lengths to actually prevent the user from knowing what is going on. Even
error messages have become unfashionable; many websites and apps just
pretend everything is fine even if it isn't. This kind of extreme
unobservability is a major source of technological alienation among computer
users.</p>

<p>The visualizations intended for casual and passive observation would be
pleasant and tranquil while making it easy to see the big picture and notice
the small changes. Tapping into the inborn human tendency to observe the
natural environment may be a good idea when designing visualizers. When the
user wants to observe something more closely, however, there is no limit in
how flashy, technical and "non-natural" the presentation can be, as long as
the observer prefers it that way.</p>

<h3>3.2. Yin and yang hacking</h3>

<p>Traditional computer hacking is often very "yang". A total understanding and
control of the target system is valued. Changing a system's behavior is
often an end in itself. There are predefined goals the system is pushed
towards. Optimization tends to focus on a single measurable parameter.
Finding a system's absolute limits is more important than finding its
individual strengths or essence.</p>

<p>In contrast, "yin" hacking accepts the aspects that are beyond rational
control and comprehension. Rationality gets supported by intuition. The
relationship with the system is more bidirectional, emphasizing
experimentation and observation. The "personality" that stems from
system-specific peculiarities gets more attention than the measurable specs.
It is also increasingly important to understand when to hack and when just
to observe without hacking.</p>

<p>The difference between yin and yang hacking is similar to the difference
between permaculture and …</p></div>

</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the longest time, I've been afraid to speak up about my story with App Review, fearing I'd put my popular app at risk. I've now decided that being transparent and sharing my experience to help others is worth it, so here it goes:👇</p>— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1274356729224892416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>
I admire Apple, and I believe the world is a better place because of them. As a developer, I’ve made my career on their platform and I’m grateful for it.
But I have some criticism. I’m&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;here to talk about my story, the 30% Apple developer cut, the App Review process, or to challenge any of their guidelines.
I want to talk about&nbsp;<em>transparency</em>, and <em>accountability</em>.
</p>
<p>
For far too long, developers have been discouraged from being able to share their rejection stories with the world.
"If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps", used to be the official guidance.
The risk too great for most, the fear of retribution overwhelming.
And so the stories have largely remained in the shadows, with only a few exceptions.
But there’s another, critical reason why such stories rarely see the light of day, one that hasn’t received enough attention:
</p>
<blockquote><b>Apple is systematically erasing our stories.</b></blockquote>

<p>
Unless we’re talking about your most recent submission, all communication you have <em>ever</em> sent or received through the "Resolution Center" is inaccessible to you.
Rejection notices, appeal results, anything you might want to reference to better understand previous about your product - it's all gone.
Unless you have meticulously and manually kept copies of all correspondence, what happened in the past will forever stay in the past. But why should it?
</p>
<p>
It’s not hard to see why Apple is doing this.
It <em>is</em> hard, however, to see a reason that benefits anyone but Apple.
In doing so, they gain more peace of mind, less worry about consistency and correctness in applying the public guidelines.
The appeal mechanism helps them improve, but only to the extent that Apple deems necessary.
If we ever wanted to know how well Apple is enforcing the guidelines, we have to take their word for it.
But who guards the guardians, when App Review’s accountability to the world has been intentionally reduced to the bare minimum?
</p>
<p>
Transparency is not always the solution.
We can’t expect Apple to be open about their future product plans, for example.
But when they communicate with developers, they should do so like everyone is watching - every time.
And to get there, the <em>possibility</em> that everyone might find out needs to always be on the table.
</p>
<p>
So Apple, please help us see App Review as a reliable ally.
Let us access our past communications with you - including phone call records if we choose to.
Show us that you want to be accountable for what you communicate to developers. There may be some legal challenges, but transparency is a prerequisite to accountability.
It’s only then that we can begin to have a fair and honest discussion with you about the actual process and guidelines.
Because until then, we’re in the shadows.

<p>Gray code encoding is a bijective function between natural numbers (including 0) in a way that the Gray code of subsequent integers only differ in a single binary digit.
This encoding was proved useful for rotary encoders and other kinds of counting where switching multiple bits at once would be problematic.</p>

<p><img src="https://leni536.github.io/assets/Gray_10bit_rotary_encoder.svg" alt="pdep figure"><br>
A 10bit Gray code rotary encoder.</p>

<p>I use the following common definition for Gray code encoding:</p>



<p>where  denotes the ,,bitwise exclusive or’’ and  denotes the ,,bitwise right shift’’ operators.</p>



<p>I denote the inverse of the function  with .
 can be expressed in the following way:</p>



<p>It can be shown that  is indeed the inverse of  using the commutative and associative properties of  and the following identities:</p>





<p>Implementing Gray code encoding is rather simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>gray_encode</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>i</span><span>^</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can implement Gray code decoding directly from the defining expression of :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>gray_decode</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ret</span> <span>^</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
        <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can actually do better for a known fixed-width integral type.
The following algorithm is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code#Converting_to_and_from_Gray_code">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>gray_decode</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>16</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>4</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can show the correctness of this implementation using the identities I presented before and induction.</p>

<p>I also developed an alternative implementation that makes use of the <code>popcnt</code> and <code>pdep</code> x86_64 CPU instructions (part of the POPCNT and BMI2 extensions respectively).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;x86intrin.h&gt;
</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>gray_decode</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>evens</span>
        <span>=</span> <span>_pdep_u32</span><span>(</span><span>0x55555555u</span><span>,</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>odds</span>
        <span>=</span> <span>_pdep_u32</span><span>(</span><span>0xAAAAAAAAu</span><span>,</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>popcount</span>
        <span>=</span> <span>__builtin_popcount</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>popcount</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
           <span>^</span> <span>((</span><span>odds</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>evens</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>1</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the following sections I break down how this implementation works.
I stick with 32 bit numbers, but my reasoning works for any bitwidth.</p>

<p>If  
  and  – 
  where the bold letters denote binary digits – then .
In other words one can get the th digit in  by xoring the digits from the th to the most significant digit in .
For a given  where the 1 digits are sparsely laid out one can think of  in the following way:</p>



<p>The leading digits (from the most significant digits) are 0 up until the first 1 digit in .
Then the following digits in  are all 1 up until the next 1 digit in , and so on.
The 1 digits in  mark the transitions between strips of 0s and 1s in .
For this description it’s not required that the 1s in  are sparsely laid out,
  it just makes the intuition easier (for me at least).</p>

<p>I define  by taking every second 1 binary digit in  starting from the least significant one.
I also define  by taking every second 1 binary digit in  starting from the second least significant one.
 and  correspond to the <code>evens</code> and <code>odds</code> variables in my <code>gray_decode</code> function above.</p>



<p>After adding  and , where  denotes bitwise negation, the result has similar strips of 0s and 1s as :</p>



<p>There are two main differences to :</p>

<ol>
  <li>The transitions between the strips of 0s and 1s start one place to the right compared to .</li>
  <li>The first strips from the left can be all 1s or all 0s depending if there are even or odd number of 1 digits in .</li>
</ol>

<p>The first issue can be fixed by shifting  and  to the left by one place beforehand.
The second difference can be addressed by first calculating if there are even or odd number of 1 bits in .
Then one can flip the bits in the result for the even case.</p>

<p>I denote the number of 1 bits in  as , this corresponds to the <code>popcnt</code> variable in my <code>gray_decode</code> function.
By applying these fixes we get the following expression for :</p>



<p>The branching between the even and odd cases can also be eliminated by xoring the intermediate result with <code>00…0</code> or <code>11…1</code> depending on the parity of .
 is either 0 or 1 ,  is either <code>00…0</code> or <code>11…11</code> for the even and odd cases respectively.
Since bitwise negation is required for the even case an additional bitwise negation is necessary:</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/da1juk/implementations_for_gray_code_encoding_and/f1mp1rt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">IJzerbaard pointed out</a> that this expression can be further simplified by using the  and  identities:</p>



<p>The <code>popcnt</code> and <code>pdep</code> CPU instructions can be used to calculate ,  and  efficiently.</p>

<p>The <code>popcnt</code> instruction takes one source and one destination argument.
It writes the number of 1 binary digits in the source and returns the count in the destination.
 can be calculated by applying <code>popcnt</code> on .</p>

<p><code>pdep</code> takes two source arguments (<code>src</code> and <code>mask</code>) and one destination argument (<code>dst</code>).
It takes the low bits from <code>src</code> and deposits them in the destination to the corresponding set bit locations in <code>mask</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://leni536.github.io/assets/pdep.svg" alt="pdep figure"></p>

<p>One can calculate  by using <code>pdep</code> and setting <code>src</code> to <code>0101…01</code> and <code>mask</code> to .
 can be calculated similarly with <code>pdep</code> but with <code>1010…10</code> as <code>src</code>.
This is how <code>evens</code> and <code>odds</code> are calculated in my <code>gray_decode</code> function, the magic numbers are the <code>src</code> arguments.</p>



<p>I think there is no correct way to objectively benchmark these Gray code decoding functions in isolation.
One can call these functions in a tight loop and compare their throughput that way, but one shouldn’t take the resulting numbers too seriously.</p>

<p>I used Google’s benchmark library and the following setup:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Generic32</span><span>(</span><span>benchmark</span><span>::</span><span>State</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>gray_decode_generic</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>benchmark</span><span>::</span><span>DoNotOptimize</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>state</span><span>.</span><span>SetBytesProcessed</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>*</span><span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>BENCHMARK</span><span>(</span><span>Generic32</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly for all the other functions for both <code>uint32_t</code> and <code>uint64_t</code>.
I compiled the benchmark with <code>gcc -O2</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-------------------------------------------------
Benchmark          Time           CPU Iterations
-------------------------------------------------
Generic32          2 ns          2 ns   58150989   1.56283GB/s
PDEP32             2 ns          2 ns   82701968   2.18142GB/s

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The throughput of the <code>popcnt</code> and <code>pdep</code> method is somewhat faster in this specific benchmark.</p>



<ol>
  <li> can also be calculated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-less_product">carry-less multiplying</a>  with <code>11…1</code> and fixing the result with <code>popcnt</code>.
The PCLMUL extension provides this operation, but it can only carry-less multiply 64bit arguments and it still requires XMM registers.
The performance of this method wasn’t great the last time I tried.
There can easily be a CPU instruction that could help beating my method at least in a streaming case, but I’m not familiar with all of the vector instructions.</li>
  <li>Fun fact:  is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence">Thue–Morse sequence</a></li>
  <li>I use a variation of my algorithm in my <a href="https://github.com/leni536/fast_hilbert_curve">fast Hilbert-curve</a> library.
For my purposes I don’t need to shift  and .</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/da1juk/implementations_for_gray_code_encoding_and/f1mul2e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">IJzerbaard</a> discovered an other improvement: the left shifting can be done early before the pdep instructions, this saves a single instruction in the resulting binary when compiled with gcc:</p>

In this release, Gloo has been tested and validated to work with the latest </span><a href="https://istio.io/latest/"><span>Istio 1.6</span></a><span> release. Additionally, </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2703"><span>Gloo now supports ALPN on the upstream</span></a><span> for more granular control on defining which protocol to use and helps with the integration to the latest version of Istio. Try the Gloo and Istio integration tutorial </span><a href="https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/guides/integrations/service_mesh/gloo_istio_mtls/"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Security Enhancements&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>In this release we expanded security capabilities to protect the Gloo system and applications in the environment including </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2929"><span>supporting TLS in the external auth service</span></a><span>&nbsp; instead of through an envoy sidecar to handle the TLS termination, the addition of </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1525"><span>audit logs for the Modsecurity Web Application Filter</span></a><span> (WAF) as part of the access logs to assist debugging and auditing purposes, encrypted communication is now possible with </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2134"><span>mTLS between Gloo and Envoy instances</span></a><span> for when these components are deployed to separate environments, and an </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3084"><span>update to the Gloo permissions</span></a><span> reduces the surface area for risk by enabling it to run in a fully restricted Kubernetes environment.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>User Experience Improvements for Developers and Operations</span></h2><p><span>Across the CLI and Admin UI we’ve made a number of improvements to expand the functionality of glooctl, expand observability capabilities and error handling to resolve system issues.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><b>glooctl</b><b> updates include</b><span> extending the timeout period for port forwarding from 3 to 30 seconds before a</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2771"><span>connection refused errors is displayed</span></a><span> improves how commands like </span><span>glooctl check</span><span> or </span><span>glooctl proxy dump</span> <span>work in high latency environments with more time to finish, the </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2715"><span>glooctl add route</span></a><span> command no longer creates a route table or virtual service with the</span><span> –dry-run </span><span>flag, and </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2581"><span>glooctl check</span><span> now uses the default namespace</span></a><span> if a specific namespace flag is not provided.</span></li><li><span>The Admin UI has</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2812"><span>new tags in the Granfana dashboards</span></a><span> for Envoy and Kubernetes and supports </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2804"><span>additional observailiby use case</span></a><span>s with gRPC access logging service metrics.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Better error handling by </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2905"><span>logging a clear message</span></a><span> when the upstream port does not match the underlying Kubernetes service, </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2660"><span>report a status</span></a><span> when an upstream points to a non-existent service, and an </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2880"><span>update to the error message display to only show the issue </span></a><span>vs. the entire message.</span></li></ul><h2><span>Expanded Configuration Options for Gloo&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>As a flexible control plane to Envoy Proxy, Gloo is built to support a wide range of deployment scenarios and use cases. In this release we’ve added a number of new options for the admins to customize the behavior of the Gloo environment and traffic handling.</span></p><ul><li><b>New Buffer Filter Improves Request Handling:</b> <span>Gloo now supports enabling the </span><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/buffer/v3/buffer.proto#extensions-filters-http-buffer-v3-buffer"><span>Envoy buffer filter</span></a><span> which buffers the entire request before routing it to the service to process the request. This is important because it helps the system understand how big the request is (in case the request size is too big), which avoids having to deal with partial requests and high network latency. </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2444"><span>The buffer filter can be set </span></a><span>by configuring </span><span>spec.httpGateway.options.buffer </span><span>of the desired gateway and can optionally </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2835"><span>configure the bytes limit on the upstream connection</span></a><span> (default is 1MiB).&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Update to validation webhook: </b><span>Now </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2114"><span>validates inja compilation syntax</span></a><span> before accepting/rejecting virtual services that use transformations, allowing users to properly validate whether configurations are valid against live clusters before applying them&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>SSL Configuration Update: </b><span>Now allows for </span><span>specifying </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2871"><span>empty SSL configurations for clients</span></a><span> depending on the use case.</span></li><li><b>Helm Chart Updates Expand Available Settings: </b><span>They include two enhancements for Knative including the ability to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2778"><span>assign a static IP to the Knative external proxy</span></a><span> and to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/pull/2683"><span>override the Service type</span></a><span> as an alternative to Load Balancer for Ingress Proxy and Knative. Additionally, the nodeport numbers for the gateway proxy service can now&nbsp; </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2899"><span>be predefined in the values.yml</span></a><span>. We also added a </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3016"><span>new value to disable the validation admission webhook</span></a><span> for users who cannot use webhooks but still want to use the Gloo validation API, this value makes it more straightforward to implement.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Improved heading formatting:</b><span> The Envoy </span><span>core.Http1ProtocolOptions.HeaderKeyFormat</span><span> is available in the Gloo API as </span><span>httpConnectionManager.http_protocol_options.proper_case_header_key_format</span><span> which</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2940"><span>formats the header by proper casing</span></a> <span>which helps with validating the headers.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Upstream reference by name: </b><span>This allows virtual services, route tables, and upstreams to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2730"><span>refer to an upstream by name only</span></a><span>, </span><span>without causing an error. Gloo will assume the upstream namespace is the namespace of the parent resource.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Give the latest Gloo release a try and we’d love to get your feedback in the </span><a href="https://solo-io.slack.com/"><span>community slack</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo"><span>file an issue/PR on Github</span></a><span>.

                    <p><strong>The Neurostimulation product aims to replace caffeine beverages with electrical impulses delivered to the sympathetic nervous system.</strong></p><p>Recently announced Zing Energy is a disposable neurostimulation patch designed to create alertness and energy in the wearer. &nbsp;Each patch can be used twice and “delivers a five-minute waveform of proprietary electrical impulses to the greater auricular nerve, creating an autonomic nervous system response.” &nbsp;	The patch is placed behind the ear and removed after the five minute stimulation session. The effects are purported to last up to four hours and to rival or surpass the effect or energy drinks in that time period.</p><p>Thync, the company behind Zing, conducted research over a period of five years which was the basis for the development of Zing. Research and development were conducted by a team of scientists and engineers from MIT, Stanford, UCSF and Harvard.</p><p>Isy Goldwasser, CEO and co-founder at Thync, said of the launch, “Our company was founded on the mission to bring neurostimulation to mainstream consumers and offer better alternatives to consumer drinks and supplements. With the launch of Zing Energy, I believe we've delivered on both.”</p><p>Zing Energy can be obtained at <a href="https://feelzing.com/">their website</a>. &nbsp;You can read the press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thync-takes-neurostimulation-mainstream-with-zing-energy-the-first-electric-energy-patch-301061117.html">here</a>.</p>

June 25, 2020 | https://coding.blog/blog/jamstack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://coding.blog/blog/jamstack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="-codedoc-container"><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/under-the-hood-dark.svg" alt="Banner"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/under-the-hood.svg" alt="Banner"></p></div><p>Basics of providing content over the internet are fairly straight-forward: Browsers will send requests to your
server, and your server responds with some HTML potentially linked to some JS and CSS.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>How and when you generate those HTML, CSS and JS content is however an entirely different thing. You might want
to prepare them all in advance and have your server just serve them (pre-rendering), 
you might have your server generate them on the fly (SSR), 
or you might have your server ship some code to the browser that will then generate them (client-side rendering, SPAs). 
You might even generate requested content on the server and ship it with the code that 
would generate subsequently requested content on the browser (isomorphic).</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>There is one particular approach pretty suitable for blogs: you prepare most of the content before hand, then
serve it alongside code that would wire-in interactive bits and generate fully dynamic components. This is called
the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a>, and it is the approach used by <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a> and
<a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> for content generation. In this post, we go through the reasons we chose this
approach, and how we implemented it.</p><hr><p>To better understand why we chose <em>JAMStack</em> for <code>coding.blog</code> and how we set our further design goals, its good
to first have a general overview of methods of web content generation/delivery:</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Pre-Rendering</p><p>Pre-rendering simply means preparing your content before-hand, i.e. in the <em>build stage</em>. This is the fastest
delivery method, and allows you to simply use a CDN instead of writing a server for serving your content.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering-dark.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p></div><p>Server Side Rendering (SSR)</p><p>Instead of preparing the content, you can generate them on-the fly on your server, in response to each request.
This is perhaps useful when your content needs to change based on incoming requests, and perhaps you need to
get some data from some API to be able to create the content. However, this approach is obviously much slower
than pre-rendering.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr-dark.svg" alt="SSR"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr.svg" alt="SSR"></p></div><p>Client-Side Rendering and SPAs</p><p>Highly interactive and dynamic content means you need to generate content on the client-side. To avoid having
content-generation code in multiple places (which is hard to maintain / scale), you could instead conduct all
content generation on the client browser, having your server just ship the content generation code.</p><p>To avoid shipping the content generation code for each page of your site, you can also take control of the 
navigation on the client side, which leads to a <em>Single Page Application</em> (SPA for short). This is the basis
of all modern front-end frameworks.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr-dark.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p></div><p>Client-side rendering means the user should wait extra time for being able to see the content, since typically
servers are faster at generating content. It also messes up with SEO, since crawlers might not be able to even
get the content in its full form (since they are not browsers) and so might not be able to properly index it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Isomorphic Apps</p><p>To overcome these issues without spreading the content generation code in multiple places, the concept of <em>isomorphic apps</em>
was introduced. The idea is to basically run the same code both on the server and on the client, while also shipping
the code itself to the client alongside content rendered on the server.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic-dark.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p></div><p>The complexity of isomorphic apps inevitably brings extra constraints and overheads. For example, you need to re-hydrate
the content on client-side, which means you are limited on how you manipulate that content (e.g. for React SSR, React needs
to maintain full control of the DOM tree). These complexities also make it harder to optimize performance since many more
components and their interactions are affecting it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>JAMStack Apps</p><p>Another approach would be to pre-render all your static content and then ship the code for filling in dynamic/interactive
parts to the client. This would allow for the same delivery speed of pre-rendering without sacrificing interactivity
of the content. It also implies a clear separation in the code-base as opposed to isomorphic apps: there is code that
pre-renders stuff, and there is code that goes to client and makes stuff interactive.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack-dark.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p></div><p>The JAMStack architecture is specifically suitable for mostly static content, which makes it a perfect choice
for likes of <strong>CODEDOC</strong> (which is for documentation / guides about codes) and <code>coding.blog</code> (which is for blogs about
coding / programming). The simplicity of the workflow allows for easy optimization and high degrees of interoperability
and extensibility.</p><hr><p>While the JAMStack architecture was the most suitable for <a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> and <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a>,
it mandates a split of content generation code into bits that are executed at build stage and bits that are
shipped to the client. This can quickly add a lot of complexity/overhead for any growing project, so we had to
find a solution that addressed this particular issue.</p><p>In other words, we needed to:</p><ul><li>have a shared component system</li><li>easily mark client-side components so that they are not pre-rendered</li><li>seamlessly where these components were to be rendered in the DOM tree</li><li>conveniently and efficiently collect and bundle the code of these clients</li><li>conveniently attach these bundles to pre-rendered content</li></ul><marker><br>

</marker><p>Additionally, we wanted a minimal toolchain and stack with maximum extensibility and interoperability. Generally
we wanted knowledge of HTML/JS/CSS to suffice for serious customization, which made a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>-based 
syntax an optimal choice for our component system (specifically as Typescript supports it out of the box).</p><p>However, we couldn't use a library like React (or any VirtualDOM based solution) since its sensitivity to external changes to 
the DOM tree meant limitations on how the DOM is manipulated by extensions, either during pre-rendering or on the client.
Besides, we needed our content to be as light-weight as possible, which simply prohibited relatively heavy-weight
operations such as VirtualDOM diffing.</p><hr><p>To satisfy our design goals, we created a JSX-based rendering tool which directly sits on top of DOM APIs.

<p>Static vs dynamic linking usually has to do with our tolerance for the size of our final executable. A<em> static </em>executable contains all code necessary to run the executable, so the operating system loads the executable into memory, and it’s off to the races. However, if we keep duplicating code over and over again, such as printf, then it starts to use up more and more space. So, a <em>dynamic</em> executable means that we only store <em>stubs</em> in the executable. Whenever we want to access printf, it goes out to a <em>dynamic linker</em> and loads the code essentially <em>on demand</em>. So, we sacrifice a tiny bit of speed for a much smaller executable.</p>

<h2 id="linking">What is Linking?</h2>



<p>When I hear someone talk about <em>compiling</em> their program into an executable, they are really eliding over several stages. The definition of  compiling is to <em>produce something by combining information collected from different sources.</em> In computing, we generally think of compiling as turning a higher-level language, such as C, into a lower-level code, such as assembly.</p>



<p>The final stage before we get an executable is the <em>linking</em> stage. This is where we <em>link</em> (hence the name) all sources together to produce one coherent executable. This is also where all outstanding symbols need to be resolved. Symbol is just fancy for the name of a function or global variable.</p>



<p>We can take a look at <em>object code, </em>which is what we get after we assemble but before we link. Here’s an object dump of an example program.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void some_func(int a, int b);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (argc &lt; 3) {
		printf("Not enough arguments.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	int a = atoi(argv[1]);
	int b = atoi(argv[2]);

	some_func(a, b);

	return 0;
}</pre>



<p>This code produces the following object code, which I disassemble using objdump for RISC-V.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png" alt="" width="500" height="341" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png 667w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></figure></div>



<p>Notice that the function some_func has been prototyped, but has not been defined. This will be the responsibility of the linker to find the symbol some_func and add it into our program. Notice what happens when I try to link this program without ever defining some_func.</p>



<pre>/opt/riscv_1/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/9.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /tmp/ccmgFc75.o:
<br>
in function .L2': test.c:(.text+0x62): undefined reference to some_func'
<br>
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</pre>



<p>The linker is looking for the symbol some_func, but it cannot find it, so we get an <em>undefined reference</em>. We know this is at the linker stage because the error is “ld returned 1 exit status”. The “ld” means “linker”.</p>



<p>We also can see that the address of the function main is 0, this is because we haven’t linked a program. So, our object code just contains <em>bubbles</em> of code, which will then be placed into our executable at certain locations by the linker.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="finding">Finding Symbols</h2>



<p>If we use the command <em>nm</em>, which is used to list symbols in an object file, we can see all of the <em>unresolved</em> symbols. Our object code is looking for these, but it doesn’t need to know where they are until we have a full executable program.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png 317w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see that in this object file, the linker has a little bit of work to do. It must find atoi, puts, and some_func, which are flagged as U for undefined symbols. When we execute the linker, we will specify certain libraries, such as -lc (the C library), which most of these symbols will be found. Our some_func has never been defined, so our linker cannot really succeed until we define it somewhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="static">Static Libraries (archives)</h2>



<p>Archive files generally end in .a and contain code and other information that will be added to the final executable. Essentially, archive files are just a collection of object files into one file. Therefore, when we link to an archive file, we extract the actual code from the object code into our executable. The nice thing about archive files is that we don’t need to add ALL symbols into our executable–we only need those symbols that need to be used.</p>



<p>Usually, we have archive versions of all libraries to allow for <em>static</em> executables. These executables are those that don’t need any additional loading to run. In other words, these are self-contained files. The linker stage will pull in the code directly from the .a file into the executable, and all is done. The more code that the linker pulls in, the larger the executable will be.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and define some_func and see how linking works.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void some_func(int a, int b)
{
	printf("Data = %d\n", a * b);
}
</pre>



<p>It’s very simple, but the point is to have some code that the linker can pull in. Recall that the linker gave us an “undefined reference” error because we didn’t define some_func. Now, we have it defined, so let’s see what happens.</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o test test2.o test.o</pre>



<p>Notice that I’m using gcc still. This will automatically invoke the linker and pull in the necessary <em>start files</em>. If we invoke the linker directly, we have to define _start and tell the program how to start, or we would have to directly specify the start files.</p>



<p>I specify -static so that gcc will pull in only .a files. When we are done, the file <em>test</em> will be a fully-contained, static executable. If we take a look at this file, we can see that all of the “stuff” we need for this executable makes it a fairly large file.</p>



<pre>-rwxr-xr-x 1 smarz smarz 4687920 Jun 1 09:16 test</pre>



<p>Yes, that’s 4,687,920 bytes or about 4.7 megabytes. However, if we looked at the symbol table, we will find that NO symbol is unresolved, and therefore this is a self contained executable. If we load this with our elf loader, no external resources will need to be pulled in.</p>



<p>Our linker must exhaustively follow every possible route and pull in those symbols even though they may never be called. We can see the symbol table is enormous due to all of the calls and global variable (such as errno).</p>

<h2 id="dynamic">Dynamic Libraries (shared objects)</h2>



<p>Dynamic libraries end in .so, which stands for <em>shared object</em>. These libraries contain code that will not be added directly into the executable. Instead a program called the <em>dynamic linker</em> will be responsible for taking code from the .so files and adding them into an executing program. We can also add symbols ourselves using the -ldl (dynamic linker) library.</p>



<p>We can think of the term <em>dynamic</em> as <em>run-time</em>. That is, we don’t actually load the code into our program until the program actually runs. We can see this with something as simple as printf. We can examine our executable and we don’t see printf’s code. Instead, we see printf’s <em>stub</em>. This stub will then be replaced by the dynamic loader when the program executes.</p>



<p>When we link with a dynamic, shared object, those symbols that can be added at run time will remain unresolved. We will have the symbols’ names put into a table just so we know it’s out there somewhere. However, with shared objects, we now can get that <em>unresolved reference</em> (or symbol) at run-time! If you have arch-linux and have ever compiled anything yourself, you might’ve run into this phenomenon.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Making a Shared Library</h2>



<p>Let’s go ahead and turn our test2 file into a shared object. This is fairly easy to do with gcc:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -fPIC -shared -o libtest2.so test2.o</pre>



<p>The switch -fPIC stands for <em>position independent code</em>. That means all offsets cannot be relative outside of the library itself, and this is usually the case for most shared libraries. In this case, the generated code will be placed into a table to find the offsets. This is required since the library, or specific symbols in the library, can be loaded into any location by the dynamic linker.</p>



<p>Then, we can compile our test program to link to this shared library:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -o test test.o -L. -ltest2</pre>



<p>In the command above, I am specify the library search path with -L, so -L. means to look in the current directory. Then, I specify the library to link with using -ltest2. GCC will automatically prepend lib and append .so to make libtest2.so.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="analyze">Analyzing A Shared Program</h2>



<p>First, we compile in the location of our library. We can see these shared libraries using the ldd command.</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ ./test<br>
./test: error while loading shared libraries: libtest2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>



<p>So, when I run my program, it looks at a certain path to find your libraries. This is analogous to the PATH environment variable, except in Linux (and some UNIXes), we use LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Shown below, if I change my path so the dynamic linker can find my library, it functions properly:</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/smarz ./test 10 20<br>
Data = 200</pre>



<hr>



<h2 id="unresolved">Unresolved at Run Time</h2>



<p>When we link a program, many of the symbols will remain unresolved. This tells us what symbols the dynamic linker is responsible for loading from the shared objects (libraries). We can see these unresolved symbols using the nm command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Why Site Reliability Engineering<br></h3><p>In the world of technology, the stakes have never been higher. The move to the cloud and microservices to maximize agility has given way to digital disruptors and unprecedented competitive threats. As distributed systems become increasingly complex, the scale of ‘unknown unknowns’ increases. On top of this, customer expectations are sky-high. The cost of downtime is catastrophic, with customers willing to churn if their needs are not promptly met. According to <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a>, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/753938/worldwide-enterprise-server-hourly-downtime-cost/">average cost of downtime</a> is $300,000 per hour. For some companies, this number is considerably higher; for example , Amazon lost approximately $90 million during their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/amazon-prime-day-outage-cost/">Prime Day outage</a> in 2018, and the outage only lasted 75 minutes.<br></p><p>Organizations need to prioritize reliability so they can innovate as quickly as possible on top of a strong foundation that won’t compromise customer experience. This will become even more critical as more businesses move toward distributed systems with high reliability requirements. That’s where site reliability engineering (SRE) comes in. The SRE function is growing quickly <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-site-reliability-engineers-face-more-security-incidents-and-higher-stress-levels/">(30-70% YoY growth in job listings)</a>, but there is not enough skilled talent in the market to compensate. In other words, it will be important to understand how you can not just hire SREs, but grow your <em>existing</em> organization to adopt the practices and mindsets required for production excellence. With the shortage of SREs for hire, what can you do to ensure your service’s reliability? To answer this question, you’ll need a deeper understanding of what SRE actually is.<br></p><h3>What is SRE?</h3><p>SRE is a practice first coined by Google in 2003 that seeks to create systems and services that are reliable enough to satisfy customer expectations. Since then, many large organizations such as LinkedIn and Netflix, have adopted SRE best practices. In recent years, SRE has become more widely adopted by many&nbsp; organizations globally, with the goal of reliability and resilience in mind in light of exponentially growing customer expectations as well as systems complexity.<br></p><p>SRE is based on a customer-first mentality. This means that SRE efforts are all tied to customer satisfaction, even if the customers using the service are actually internal users. Each decision should result in an increase in customer satisfaction. Teams work together to determine which factors and experiences affect customer happiness, measure them, set goals, and balance reliability requirements with the innovation velocity required to stay viable in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.<br></p><p>To achieve this lofty goal, SREs and teams that have adopted SRE best practices refer to several key tenets of SRE. According to <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/">Google,</a> these include:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ensuring a durable focus on engineering</li><li>Pursuing maximum change velocity without violating a service level objective (SLO)</li><li>Monitoring, including alerts, ticketing, and logging</li><li>Emergency response</li><li>Change management</li><li>Demand forecasting and capacity planning</li><li>Provisioning, and</li><li>Efficiency and performance<br></li></ul><p>According to <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/46-of-google-sre-applies-directly-to-your-enterprise-what-about-the-rest/">Forrester</a>, 46% of the tenets can be applied out-of-the-box for most software teams in the enterprise, but the rest require customizations or won’t make sense for the vast majority of organizations. The important question to ask yourself is how these tenets fit in with what you’re already doing, and how your teams can improve.</p><h3>Understanding How SRE Fits Into Your DevOps Practices</h3><p>Think of SRE as the practice that brings life to the DevOps philosophy. The core principles of DevOps and SRE are nearly identical. According to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/site-reliability-engineering-slos/">Google’s Coursera course</a> on SRE, “class SRE implements DevOps,” the 5 DevOps principles are as follows:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Reduce organizational silos</strong>: SRE helps by sharing ownership across developers and production teams, and unifying tooling.</li><li><strong>Accept failure as normal</strong>: Blameless postmortems are an SRE best practice that ensures that all incidents are used as learning opportunities. SRE also creates a safe space and guardrails for failure through SLOs and error budgets.</li><li><strong>Implement gradual change</strong>: This is done by canarying rollouts to a small subset of customers before allowing all users to interact with new features. Smaller changes are easier and safer to dissect and iterate on.</li><li><strong>Leverage tooling and automation</strong>: SREs work to eliminate toil by measuring it and creating automation to do repetitive tasks without needing human intervention. This way, humans can focus on higher-value work.</li><li><strong>Measure everything: SRE specifically focuses on measuring toil and reliability to make sure that both customers and software teams are happy with the service.</strong><br></li></ol><p>With these common principles defined, it’s easy to see how SRE and DevOps fit really well together, with SRE codifying practices that make it easier to achieve the promises of DevOps. In fact, you could say that SRE is the human side of DevOps, the culture-building function that approaches systems with the people who run them in mind.</p><h3>A human approach to systems</h3><p>Resiliency engineering as a practice looks at systems holistically, considering not only infrastructure but also human, process, and cultural factors. Without adopting the culture and mindset behind SRE, you’ll simply have new processes with no uniting value at the center to keep the initiative in place. Focusing on the human approach to systems requires reevaluating your organization’s attitude towards three crucial things.</p><h4>On-call &amp; full service ownership practices</h4><p>The notion of on-call is important in SRE for several reasons. It establishes clear ownership to ensure software problems are immediately addressed, and inherently incentivizes developers to ship more performant code. But while going on-call is now a fairly common practice, establishing a healthy, balanced process is crucial to prevent burnout. Nobody can be on-call 24/7, especially when incidents during the on-call period actively disrupt engineers' personal lives. People need uninterrupted time away from work to be at their best, so on-call responsibilities need to be carefully monitored. If someone is waking up at 2 AM every night for a full month, there’s something wrong; it’s simply unsustainable. Additionally, more than one person should have to carry the burden. The whole development team should be empowered to be on-call so the responsibility becomes a shared one. This also incentivizes developers to ship better code to avoid getting woken up at 2 AM.<br></p><p>SRE best practices encourage a better proactive system, with a robust reactive system in place. Being proactive means fostering a community of constant learning and improvement. When your engineers are better prepared and learning from previous incidents, it’s less likely that the same mistakes will be made again. This lowers the amount of incidents occurring as your SRE practice matures. From a reactive perspective, better incident management practices can allow for streamlined communication during an incident, and provide a foundation to treat incidents as ‘unplanned investments’ as they become important learning opportunities. Postmortems thus give engineers a place to begin looking when the root cause of an incident is evading them. SRE gives those who hold the pager more agency.</p><h4>Keeping burnout at bay</h4><p>Constant firefighting, especially with a tough on-call schedule, can leave engineers feeling burnt out. Over time, burnout leads to high turnover rates, meaning the senior engineering will need to pick up additional slack while new hires are ramped up. This only increases burnout, leading to a vicious cycle of dissatisfied engineers who have little capacity to think about improvements, and new hires who are clueless about where to begin.<br></p><p>In this situation, the SRE approach would encourage improved visibility into engineering hours, on-call periods, and repeat incidents. Each of these issues directly contributes to burnout, yet many organizations aren’t tracking them. By knowing which engineers have spent abnormally high hours over an extended period of time, team leads can suggest vacation time to curb burnout. Knowing who has been on-call every weekend for the last month allows teams to better manage the rotation so everyone gets a break. Monitoring repeat incidents and incidents of a similar class can give insight into what’s burning through engineering hours, as well as whether previous postmortems uncovered improvements or follow-up items that were not taken action on. These are issues that should promptly be fixed in order to give teams a break from firefighting, and more time for strategic work.</p><h4>Celebrating failure</h4><p>Failure will happen, incidents will occur, and SLOs will be breached. These things may be difficult to face, but part of adopting SRE is to acknowledge that they are the norm. Systems are made by humans, and humans are imperfect. What’s important is learning from these failures and celebrating the opportunity to grow.<br></p><p>One way to foster this culture is to prioritize psychological safety in the workplace. The power of safety is very obvious, but often overlooked. Industry thought leaders like Gene Kim have been promoting the importance of feeling safe to fail. He addresses the issue of psychological insecurity in his novel, “The Unicorn Project.” Main character Maxine has been shunted from a highly-functional team to Project Phoenix, where mistakes are punishable by firing. Gene writes “She’s [Maxine] seen the corrosive effects that a culture of fear creates, where mistakes are routinely punished and scapegoats fired. Punishing failure and ‘shooting the messenger’ only cause people to hide their mistakes, and eventually, all desire to innovate is completely extinguished.”<br></p><p>Getting the most out of your teams and systems cannot be achieved if blame exists. Blamelessness is at the core of SRE. To fully adopt this practice, you need to acknowledge that people are not a source of failure. Each team member is simply doing their best with the knowledge at hand, making the decisions they believe are right and in the best interests of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apache Kafka has gained traction as one of the most widely adopted technologies for building streaming applications - but introducing it (and scaling it) into your business can be a struggle.</p><p>The problem isn’t with Kafka itself so much as the different components you need to learn and different tools required to operate it.</p><p>For those motivated enough, you can invest money, effort and long Friday nights into learning, fixing and streamlining Kafka - and you’ll get there.&nbsp;</p><p>But for those that prefer to spend time focusing on the data and would rather master Kafka’s value than its inner-workings, fear not.&nbsp;</p><p>When we started Lenses.io, we experienced first-hand how difficult it can be to set up a Kafka development environment; so we decided to follow an anti-pattern and create a docker image with a full-fledged Kafka installation: the<a href="https://github.com/lensesio/fast-data-dev"> fast-data-dev docker</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/dH7CDIWIgsRCvAqBzqE31/90912a877cfab5860632ea82905ed00d/kafka_docker.PNG" alt="Lenses Kafka docker"></span></p><p>
The community loved it and we are grateful for this.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward and we created Lenses.io, understanding that now the challenge was operating Kafka and real-time applications and data. So we wanted to create a tool to provide the best developer experience for Kafka: Lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is only natural that we had to add it to fast-data-dev and make it free for developers, the people to whom we owe our success.</p><p>Hence, enter the Lenses Box; our most popular download!</p><h3>A complete Kafka-in-a-box</h3><p>To start with, the Box gives you an environment including:
</p><ul><li><p><b>1-node Kafka and Zookeeper</b>: your Kafka service, ready to receive data.</p></li><li><p><b>Kafka Connect</b>: use it to bring data in and out of Kafka, from DBs for example.</p></li><li><p><b>Schema Registry</b>: safely control the structure of your data in Kafka, powered by Avro.</p></li><li><p><b>Elasticsearch</b>: ship your streaming results here for powerful search.</p></li></ul><p>All in a single docker container.</p><p>That’s already quite a lot of time off your plate. Then we package....</p><h3>... A DataOps workspace</h3><p>
In the same container, you’ll get a Lenses.io workspace fully integrated with the Kafka environment.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Lenses.io, it’s an engineering portal for building &amp; operating real-time applications on Apache Kafka.</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7DWv3Bt0Hktaxp0wffQrPV/5732afddba639697e37f3342beafbe0d/Portal_blog_copy.jpg" alt="Lenses.io Box Apache Kafka docker container for localhost development"></span></p><h3>How does Box help me develop real-time applications?</h3><p>
As a docker container that unifies all these different technologies into a single developer experience, Box is a perfect solution to learn Kafka or to develop real-time applications on a local instance before promoting to another Kafka environment.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/sXmd6nQXmkgivJ9ejXxhh/5d6cc3687660dd1ac5655348bf1bf240/Portal_blog2.jpg" alt="Portal blog2"></span></p><p>So, if you’re a developer, you can <code>docker&nbsp;run</code> Lenses.io Box on your machine and try out the following use cases.</p><h3>Connect custom applications &amp; explore data in streams</h3><p>Connect your custom application, written in whatever framework you choose, to the Kafka broker just like you would with any other Kafka environment. Once you’ve done this, you’ll have full visibility into your custom application within a workspace. This includes being able to explore data in the streams using SQL, viewing and alerting on lag. If you use the <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/dev/topology/index.html">Topology client</a>, you’ll be able to even see the full topology of your pipelines.&nbsp;
</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/56OrFbezKepp4RQZEqz7Xn/27a231c4ae58faddbd8e2f0025f74832/image.png" alt="IntelliJ - Connecting consumer or producer client to Lenses.io Box localhost Apache Kafka broker"></span></p><h3>Build &amp; evolve schemas</h3><p>
Your gateway into streaming structured data. With support for multiple standard serialization formats, custom formats, and Schema Registry, you can use Box to understand your data and experiment with schemas and evolution. Lenses SQL gives you a perfect playground to iterate and verify your schema changes.
</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2D7lSbSE37jmPozW5CGMTb/be2ead015664934f37144a30082650c6/docker-run-lenses.PNG" alt="Docker run Kafka on Lenses"></span></p><p>Do you like SQL? If so, use it to create schemas directly. For example the following statement will create a topic with an AVRO schema for the value of the topic.&nbsp;
</p><pre>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(id&nbsp;string,&nbsp;name&nbsp;string,&nbsp;postcode&nbsp;string,&nbsp;city&nbsp;string)</pre><pre></pre><pre>FORMAT&nbsp;(string,&nbsp;avro)</pre><pre></pre><pre>PROPERTIES&nbsp;(partitions=3,&nbsp;compacted=false);&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>You can run these statements from the browser or from a CLI</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/nObbLUdN7CVPbGKWxf4n8/30e14ad7dbc9797d690238f2817fdcba/image.png" alt="Lenses.io CLI - create Apache Kafka topic and AVRO schema from command line with SQL"></span></p><h3>Test a microservice by injecting data into a stream using SQL</h3><p>
If you’re developing a streaming application that will be read from Kafka, you are effectively making a <b>Kafka consumer.</b> You will be connecting it to the Broker and you might want to test how it behaves when actually consuming data from a stream.
</p><p>That same SQL Engine I mentioned earlier, also extends to injecting data into a topic. For example:&nbsp;</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(id,&nbsp;name,&nbsp;postcode,&nbsp;city)&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>VALUES&nbsp;('23423','Xavier',&nbsp;'75009',&nbsp;'Paris'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('56456','Anne',&nbsp;'E24',&nbsp;'London'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('8734','Todd',&nbsp;'10175',&nbsp;'New&nbsp;York'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('6735463','Denise',&nbsp;'3207',&nbsp;'Melbourne');</pre><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/40FjAJMM5z8Apl3dv0kG7z/56918c58b7a96945dffe8e99539fcbad/image.png" alt="Insert data into an Apache Kafka topic via the Lenses.io CLI client and SQL statement"></span></p><h3>Configure Kafka Connect connectors</h3><p>The easiest way to bring data in and out of Kafka is with the Kafka Connect connectors. They are standard patterns of moving data between Kafka and other data systems.</p><p>
The environment is packaged with a number of popular connectors such as Mongo, Elastic 6, Influx but you can also import others.</p><p>
Want to bring in data from a database? Want to ship your results to Influx? No problem. Just a few clicks and Lenses will get those connectors running for you.</p><p>
This is perfect for testing out the Kafka Connect configuration and connection to those source and target systems. You benefit from the feedback loop: from error handling if you’ve mis-configured anything to seeing the performance of the flow. Not to mention being able to explore the data you are sourcing or sinking with SQL.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3bO29ixv0ZCEzQ9ugBBjId/9b6ddfec459225940cdb8897e88a794e/image.png" alt="View and manage Kafka Connect connectors from the Lenses.io Box"></span></p><h3>Build SQL Streaming applications</h3><p>
Last but not least, Box is an environment to build stream processing applications with SQL.&nbsp;</p><p>The Streaming SQL engine allows you to define real-time data processing applications that enrich, filter, aggregate or reshape data streams. Ask things like:
</p><ul><li><p><i>What’s my total number sales up-till-now? Real-time.</i></p></li><li><p><i>How many clients are on my website checking out my new product right now?</i></p></li></ul><p>The answer is in the data. And all it takes is a bit of SQL. No frameworks, no code, no rocket-science engineering.</p><p>Here's an example<i>

</i></p><pre>SET&nbsp;autocreate=true;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SET&nbsp;`auto.offset.reset`='earliest';</pre><pre></pre><pre>SET&nbsp;`commit.interval.ms`='10000';</pre><pre></pre><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;frauds_detection</pre><pre></pre><pre>WITH&nbsp;tableCards&nbsp;AS&nbsp;(</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;ccNumber,&nbsp;provider,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expiry,&nbsp;accountEnabled</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;credit_cards_data</pre><pre></pre><pre>)</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;STREAM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.provider,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.ccNumber,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.transaction.currency,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count(*)&nbsp;attempts</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;credit_cards_payments&nbsp;AS&nbsp;p</pre><pre></pre><pre>INNER&nbsp;JOIN&nbsp;tableCards&nbsp;AS&nbsp;c&nbsp;ON&nbsp;p.ccNumber&nbsp;=&nbsp;c.ccNumber</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE&nbsp;c.accountEnabled&nbsp;=&nbsp;'no'</pre><pre></pre><pre>GROUP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;tumble(5,s),&nbsp;p.provider</pre><p>You don’t need extra services either.. The workload will run locally in your environment for Box. Of course with the full Lenses.io workspace, you can choose to deploy it over your existing Kubernetes infrastructure and run it at scale.</p><h3>“The Cloud”, you said?
</h3><p>As it’s next evolution, yes, Box is now available as a Cloud service!&nbsp; A full Lenses-Kafka developer environment with zero setup.&nbsp;</p><p>Sign up for free on our new <a href="http://portal.lenses.io/register">Lenses.io Portal.</a></p><p>Or if you prefer to run the Docker container yourself, get access to it from <a href="https://lenses.io/downloads/lenses/?path=wizard-form">here</a> <a href="https://lenses.io/downloads/lenses/?path=wizard-form"></a>

    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

        <p>Welcome to another episode of Elixir Wizards as we continue our journey into system and application architecture! Our featured guest today is Sundi Myint and she is here to share her journey with Elixir and her non-traditional path to programming. We hear about Sundi's interest in gaming, her role at Cava and a bit of the inspiration behind her amazing Instagram account! We discuss her first internship and how she found herself in the role quite suddenly before diving into the motivation behind her blog post on the history of emojis. Sundi did some serious research into this interesting subject and she shares some of the more technical aspects of the story with us on the show. We talk about architecture and both test and design-driven approaches. Sundi also explains her process and how mapping things out on a whiteboard has been her favored way to do things for some time. Andrea Leopardi then joins us for another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd! He answers Todd's questions about his home life, media favorites, future projects and more!</p>

                    <p>You may have good reasons to focus on developing your disrupting app. And you may well be a very talented developer. But like me, even after years of experience as a web engineer, comes a point where we have to admit we don't know that much about security.</p><p>Unless you only use fully managed solutions to host your web applications, your startup probably has a bunch of servers you have to monitor and maintain. And unless your company has the scale to pay for real DevOps, security engineers, audits or pentests, then quite frankly, we'll mainly focus on finishing the current sprint hoping to get some traction ;)</p><p>Today I got my first Ubuntu VPS from <a href="https://blog.openbloc.com/p/3f54a7d4-a161-4bf0-a9ee-8ea9c6daf259/www.ovh.com">OVH</a>, a fresh new image ready to host the next version of my website. And it's got me thinking: I do remember it's best practice to disable SSH login by password, what else should I do ? Do I need a firewall ? Surely I don't have time to fully audit this default Ubuntu image by myself...</p><p>In this article I'll show you how to harden a default Ubuntu Server 20.04 image using existing open-source tools:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.inspec.io/">Inspec</a> to identify security issues and misconfiguration</li><li><a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> to automatically harden your server</li><li><a href="https://dev-sec.io/">The DevSec Hardening Framework</a> which provides:<br>- <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline">An Inspec profile</a><br>- <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec">Ansible / Chef / Puppet recipes</a> to enforce above Inspec profile</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="quicksshsetup">Quick SSH setup</h2>
<p>Make sure your server is defined in <code>~/.ssh/config</code></p>
<pre><code>Host servername
	HostName &lt;your server ip address&gt;
	User username
	Port 22
</code></pre>
<p>To ssh into the server with your ssh key without typing the password just run:</p>
<p><code>$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub servername</code></p>
<h2 id="usinginspecwithlinuxbaselineprofile">Using Inspec with linux-baseline profile</h2>
<p>On the server:</p>
<pre><code># download and install Inspec
$ wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/inspec/4.20.2/ubuntu/20.04/inspec_4.20.2-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i inspec_4.20.2-1_amd64.deb

# clone the linux-baseline profile
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline

# run the Inspec profile
$ inspec exec linux-baseline
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/install/">Inspec installation instructions</a></p>
<p>You should see a similar output:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.openbloc.fr/2020/06/Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-01-40.png" alt="Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-01-40"></p>
<p>Next thing will be to automatically apply better OS settings using Ansible and the recipes provided by the DevSec framework.</p>
<h2 id="usingansibletohardentheserver">Using Ansible to harden the server</h2>
<p>On your local machine:</p>
<pre><code># install Ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

# install the os and ssh hardening roles
$ ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.os-hardening
$ ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.ssh-hardening
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Ansible installation instructions</a></p>
<p>We then need to write a playbook for each ansible role:</p>
<pre><code># ansible-os-hardening.yaml
- hosts: your-server
  become: true
  roles:
    - dev-sec.os-hardening
    
# ansible-ssh-hardening.yaml 
- hosts: your-server
  become: true
  roles:
    - dev-sec.ssh-hardening
</code></pre>
<p>Finally run these playbooks with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook -K ansible-os-hardening.yaml
$ ansible-playbook -K ansible-ssh-hardening.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Then, re-running <code>inspec exec linux-baseline</code> on the server should give a similar output:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.openbloc.fr/2020/06/Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-00-59.png" alt="Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-00-59"></p>
<p>Which is much better!</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Though I can't say I have audited the DevSec framework per-se, I hope you now have a better understanding on how you can automate your servers security to stay up-to-date whith industry best practices.</p>
<p>Depending on what you then run on your server, you may have to allow some ports on the Ubuntu firewall, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW">ufw</a>. Personally while testing <a href="https://caprover.com/">CapRover</a> I just had to run:</p>
<p><code>$ ufw allow 80,443,3000,996,7946,4789,2377/tcp; ufw allow 7946,4789,2377/udp;</code></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>You can find working code examples (including this one) in my <a href="https://github.com/pmuens/lab">lab repository</a> on <a href="https://github.com/pmuens">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Sometimes it's necessary to split existing data into several classes in order to predict new, unseen data. This problem is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> and one of the algorithms which can be used to learn those classes from data is called Logistic Regression.</p><p>In this article we'll take a deep dive into the Logistic Regression model to learn how it differs from other regression models such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">Linear-</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a>, how to think about it from an intuitive perspective and how we can translate our learnings into code while implementing it from scratch.</p><h2 id="linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression">Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression</h2><p>If you've read the post about <a href="https://philippmuens.com/linear-and-multiple-regression-from-scratch/">Linear- and Multiple Linear Regression</a> you might remember that the main objective of our algorithm was to find a best fitting line or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> respectively.</p><p>To recap real quick, a line can be represented via the slop-intercept form as follows:</p><p>\[ y = mx + b \]</p><p>Here, \(m\) represents the slope and \(b\) the y-intercept.</p><p>In Linear Regression we've used the existing data to find a line in slope-intercept form (a \(m\) and \(b\) combination) which "best-fitted through" such data.</p><p>Extending the slope-intercept form slightly to support multiple \(x\) values and multiple slopes (we'll use \(\beta_n\) instead of \(m_n\)) yields the following:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>This "scaled-up" slope-intercept formula was used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> model to find the \(\beta\) and \(b\) values for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> which "best-fitted" the data. Once found we were able to use it for predictions by plugging in \(x\) values to get respective \(y\) values.</p><p>Linear Regression models always map a set of \(x\) values to a resulting \(y\) value on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous</a> scale. This means that the \(y\) value can e.g. be \(0\), \(42\) or \(5.023.212\). How would we use such a Regression model if our \(y\) value is categorical such as a binary value which is either \(0\) or \(1\)? Is there a way to define a threshold so that a value such as \(42\) is assigned to the category \(1\) while a small value such as \(0.002\) gets assigned to the category \(0\)?</p><p>That's where Logistic Regression comes into play. With Logistic Regression we can map any resulting \(y\) value, no matter its magnitude to a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Let's take a closer look into the modifications we need to make to turn a Linear Regression model into a Logistic Regression model.</p><h2 id="sigmoid-functions">Sigmoid functions</h2><p>At the very heart of Logistic Regression is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid function</a>. A Sigmoid function is a class of functions which follows an S-shape when plotted.</p><p>The most prominent Sigmoid function is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">Logistic function</a> which was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst">Pierre Francois Verhulst</a> to model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth">population grown</a>. It's mathematically described via this formula:</p><p>\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \]</p><p>Don't be intimidated by the math! Right now all you need to know is that this function takes any \(x\) value and maps it to a \(y\) value which ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Plotting the function for a range of \(x\) values proofs this claim and results in the aforementioned S-shape curve:</p><figure><img src="https://philippmuens.com/content/images/2020/06/zsigmoid_result.png"></figure><p>Note that the function gets closer and closer to the \(y\) value \(0\) or \(1\) as the \(x\) values get smaller or larger respectively. Also note that the \(x\) value \(0\) results in the \(y\) value \(0.5\).</p><p>This is exactly what we need. with this function we're able to "squish" any number, no matter its magnitude into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\). This makes the function outcome predictable which is useful when we later on define threshold values to associate function outputs with classes.</p><p>Let's turn the function into code:</p><pre><code>def sigmoid(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

assert sigmoid(0) == 0.5</code></pre><p><strong><u>Note</u></strong>: Although there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function#Examples">different Sigmoid functions</a> to choose from, a lot of people use the name "Sigmoid function" when talking about the Logistic function. We'll adhere to this convention and use the term "Sigmoid function" as a synonym for Logistic function.</p><h2 id="from-linear-regression-to-logistic-regression">From Linear Regression to Logistic Regression</h2><p>Now that we've learned about the "mapping" capabilities of the Sigmoid function we should be able to "wrap" a Linear Regression model such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> inside of it to turn the regressions raw output into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Let's translate this idea into Math. Recall that our Multiple Linear Regression model looks like this:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>"Wrapping" this in the Sigmoid function (we use \(\sigma\) to represent the Sigmoid function) results in the following:</p><p>\[ y = \sigma(\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b) \]</p><p>Easy enough! Let's turn that into code.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to implement the underlying Multiple Linear Regression model. Looking at the Math it seems to be possible to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> to calculate the \(\beta\) and \(x\) part to which we then add the single \(b\) value.</p><p>To make everything easier to calculate and implement we'll use a small trick. Multyping a value by the identify \(1\) yields the value so we prepend \(1\) to the \(x\) values and \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values. This way we can solely use the dot-product calculation without the necessity to add \(b\) separately later on. Here's the mathematical formulation of that trick:</p><p>\[ \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{pmatrix} \vec{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} b \\ \beta_1 \\ ... \\ \beta_n \end{pmatrix} \]</p><p>\[ y = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{m} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \beta_i = x_1 \times \beta_1 + ... + x_n \times \beta_n \]</p><p>Once we've calculated the dot-product we need to pass it into the Sigmoid function such that its result is translated ("squished") into a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Here's the implementation for the <code>dot</code> function which calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a>:</p><pre><code>def dot(a: List[float], b: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(a) == len(b)
    return sum([a_i * b_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)])

assert dot([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 70</code></pre><p>And here's the <code>squish</code> function which takes as parameters the \(x\) and \(\beta\) values (remember that we've prepended a \(1\) to the \(x\) values and the \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values), uses the <code>dot</code> function to calculate the dot-product of \(x\) and \(\beta\) and then passes this result into the Sigmoid function to map it to a value between \(0\) and \(1\):</p><pre><code>def squish(beta: List[float], x: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(beta) == len(x)
    # Calculate the dot product
    dot_result: float = dot(beta, x)
    # Use sigmoid to get a result between 0 and 1
    return sigmoid(dot_result)

assert squish([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 1.0</code></pre><h2 id="the-intuition-behind-the-0-1-range">The intuition behind the 0-1 range</h2><p>We've talked quite a lot about how the Sigmoid function is our solution to make the function outcome predictable as all values are mapped to a \(0\) - \(1\) range. But what does a value in that range represent? Let's take a look at an example.</p><p>The following is a data set which describes how long students have studied for an exam and whether they've passed the exam given the hours they've studied.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>

What would happen if we've somehow found some coefficients \(\beta\) for the Linear Regression model which "best" describe the data and pass the result it computes through the Sigmoid function?

Here's something I want you to try: Please apply the formula by setting \(y_i\) to \(0\) and after that to \(1\) and see what happens.

    <p>Somewhere along the way toward our current JavaScript hellscape, programmers decided that HTML was over. We’re done with it.</p>

<p>The emergence of tools like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">React</a> shifted programmers away from writing HTML, instead writing <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, a fancier tag-based markup language that worked nicely inside your JavaScript.</p>

<p>Backends were then relegated to being dumb JSON API endpoints. Or if you were fancy and chasing upvotes, you’d use <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>!</p>

<p>But HTML? Yuck!</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-html-over-the-wire">A Brief History of HTML-over-the-wire</h2>

<p>One of the key pillars of Rails is to <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#integrated-systems">“Value integrated systems”</a>. While the industry moves towards microservices, highly decoupled front-ends and teams, and the siren song of Programming via LEGO Bricks, Rails leans into one system that does it all – termed the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">Majestic Monolith</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of rebuilding much of what already works in Rails in a client-side JavaScript MVC framework, apps like Basecamp, GitHub, and Shopify are able to achieve snappy page loads using the concept of “HTML-over-the-wire”.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA">seminal RailsConf 2016 talk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sstephenson">Sam Stephenson</a> walks through the pieces of this stack.</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> (or similar libraries like <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">pjax</a> or <a href="https://inertiajs.com/how-it-works">Inertia</a>) and fast HTML responses (aided by caching and avoiding excessive database queries to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBccDerJPJE">sub-100ms response times</a>), you could build high performance pages, while still hanging on to the understated benefits of stateless HTTP responses and server-side logic.</p>

<p>As Sam points out, it was truly a “Golden Age of Web Development”.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/golden-age.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So while much of the industry went down the JavaScript rabbit hole – creating new innovations for <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">reactive rendering</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">functional</a> <a href="https://redux.js.org/">state management containers</a>, and <a href="https://reach.tech/router">approximately</a> <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">seventy</a> <a href="https://github.com/frontarm/navi">different</a> <a href="https://blog.remix.run/p/remix-preview">client-side</a> <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/redwood-router">routing</a> <a href="https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found">libraries</a> – the quiet rebellion in Rails-land was honing these techniques and plugging along building apps out of boring server-rendered HTML.</p>

<p>We’re seeing a renaissance of these tools in 2020 and the excitement (at least in a small corner of the Twitter!) is reaching a fever pitch as Basecamp launches HEY: a fully-featured email client with a tiny JavaScript footprint that pushed the boundaries of the HTML-over-the-wire approach.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🤯 Basecamp is building a fully-featured, in-browser email client...using a ridiculously small amount of JavaScript. A tiny keyboard shortcut lib, one polyfill, and boring old Stimulus/Turbolinks/Rails...</p><p>🙏 to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dhh</a> for generously shipping source maps, amazing learning resource <a href="https://t.co/IEAvwjiKeO">pic.twitter.com/IEAvwjiKeO</a></p></div>— matt swanson 🤔 🦢 (@_swanson) <a href="https://twitter.com/_swanson/status/1253037966710181892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="turbolinks--stimulus-20xx-the-future">Turbolinks / Stimulus 20XX: The Future</h2>

<p>The stack in 2014-2016 was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turbolinks/pjax</li>
  <li>Rails UJS + <code>js.erb</code> templates (<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3697-server-generated-javascript-responses">Server-generated JavaScript Responses</a>)</li>
  <li>Heavy HTML fragment caching</li>
  <li>Rails Asset Pipeline and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can even trace the origin of these techniques back even further. I was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_vannoy/status/1274682764948844545">sent a link</a> to a nearly 15 year old REST “microformat” called <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/ahah">“AHAH: Asynchronous HTML and HTTP”</a>, which is an early version of the same ideas we’re so excited about today. (You shouldn’t be surprised to see <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">David Hansson</a> listed as a contributor!)</p>

<p>Now a “state-of-the-art” 2020 version also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction">StimulusJS</a> (see also <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">AlpineJS</a>) for lightweight event management, data binding, and “sprinkles” of behavior</li>
  <li>Partial updates with Turbolinks via a new <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> command approach (replacing <code>js.erb</code> and supporting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a>)</li>
  <li>Real-time Turbolinks updates via <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html">ActionCable</a> (see also <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">StimulusReflex</a>/<a href="https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/">CableReady</a>)</li>
  <li>First-party support for Webpack, ES6, and new CSS approaches like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> and <a href="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This stack is extremely powerful and the development experience allows you to really fly. You can build fast and interactive applications with a small team, all while still experiencing the joy of a 2014-era vanilla Rails codebase.</p>

<p>But years of a <a href="https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">JavaScript SPA-heavy monoculture</a> have made it hard to learn about this stack. The community is filled with practitioners, using the tools to build software and businesses. There simply has not been the same level of content produced and so many of these tools are unknown and can be unapproachable.</p>

<p>One of the ways I can contribute is to light the way for those want to know more by showing some real-world examples (not a <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TODO list</a> or a <a href="https://wsvincent.com/react-counter/">Counter</a>). Once you see how you can use tools like Stimulus and HTML responses to build features where you might instead reach for a tool like React, things will start to click.</p>

<h2 id="lets-build-something-real-hovercards">Let’s Build Something Real: Hovercards</h2>

<p>Hovercards show extra contextual information in a popup bubble when you hover over something in your app. You can see examples of this UI pattern on GitHub, Twitter, and even Wikipedia.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/hovercard-examples.png" alt="Examples of hovercard UI"></p>

<p>This feature is really easy to build with Rails using an HTML-over-the-wire approach.</p>

<p>Here’s the plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a controller action to render the hovercard as HTML</li>
  <li>Write a tiny Stimulus controller to fetch the hovercard HTML when you hover</li>
</ul>

<p>…and that’s it.</p>

<p>We don’t need to make API endpoints and figure out how to structure all of the data we need. We don’t need to reach for React or Vue to make this a client-side component.</p>

<p>The beauty of this boring Rails approach is that the feature is dead-simple and it’s equally straightforward to build. It’s easy to reason about the code and super extensible.</p>

<p>For this example, let’s build the event feed for a sneaker marketplace app.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/shoe-hovercard.gif" alt="Shoe feed hovercard example"></p>

<p>When you hover over a shoe, you see a picture, the name, the price, etc. Same for the user, you can see a mini-profile for each user.</p>

<h3 id="the-frontend-stimulus--fetch">The Frontend (Stimulus + fetch)</h3>

<p>The markup for the link looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- app/views/shoes/feed.html.erb --&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;div</span>
  <span>class=</span><span>"inline-block"</span>
  <span>data-controller=</span><span>"hovercard"</span>
  <span>data-hovercard-url-value=</span><span>"</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>hovercard_shoe_path</span><span>(</span><span>shoe</span><span>)</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>"</span>
  <span>data-action=</span><span>"mouseenter-&gt;hovercard#show mouseleave-&gt;hovercard#hide"</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>link_to</span> <span>shoe</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>shoe</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"branded-link"</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: we are using the APIs from the <a href="https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus/pull/202">Stimulus 2.0</a> preview release!</p>

<p>One of the great features of Stimulus is that you can read the markup and understand what’s happening without diving into the JavaScript.</p>

<p>Without knowing anything else about the implementation, you could guess how it’s going to work: this link is wrapped in a <code>hovercard</code> controller, when you hover (via <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events) the card is shown or hidden.</p>

<p>As recommended in <a href="https://boringrails.com/articles/better-stimulus-controllers/">Writing Better Stimulus Controllers</a>, you should pass in the URL for the hover card endpoint as a data property so that we can re-use the <code>hovercard_controller</code> for multiple types of cards. This also keeps us from having to duplicate the application routes in JavaScript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// app/javascript/controllers/hovercard_controller.js</span>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Controller</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>stimulus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Controller</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>targets</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>card</span><span>"</span><span>];</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>hidden</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>urlValue</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>())</span>
        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>html</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>const</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span>
            <span>.</span><span>createRange</span><span>()</span>
            <span>.</span><span>createContextualFragment</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>

          <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>element</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span><span>fragment</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>hide</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>hidden</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>disconnect</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is all of the JavaScript we’re going to be writing for this feature: it’s only ~30 lines and we can use this for any other hovercards in the app. There isn’t really anything app specific about this controller either, you could pull it into a separate module and re-use it across projects. It’s totally generic.</p>

<p>The controller uses the <code>fetch</code> API to call the provided Rails endpoint, gets some HTML back, and then inserts it into the DOM. As a small improvement, we use the Stimulus <code>target</code> API for data binding to save a reference to the card so that subsequent hovers over this link can simply show/hide the markup without making another network request.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/hovercard-network.gif" alt="Hovercard Network tab"></p>

<p>We also choose to remove the card when leaving the page (via the <code>disconnect</code> lifecycle method), but you could also opt to hide the card instead depending on how you want caching to work.</p>

<h3 id="the-backend-rails--server-rendered-html">The Backend (Rails + Server rendered HTML)</h3>

<p>There is nothing magic on the frontend and it’s the same story on the backend.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/routes.rb</span>
<span>Rails</span><span>.</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>.</span><span>draw</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>resources</span> <span>:shoes</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>member</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>get</span> <span>:hovercard</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Setup a route for <code>/shoes/:id/hovercard</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/controllers/shoes_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ShoesController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>hovercard</span>
    <span>@shoe</span> <span>=</span> <span>Shoe</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:id</span><span>])</span>

    <span>render</span> <span>layout: </span><span>false</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Write a basic controller action, the only difference being that we set <code>layout: false</code> so that we do not use the global application layout for this endpoint.</p>

<p>You can even visit this path directly in your browser to quickly iterate on the content and design. The workflow gets even better when using a utility-based styling approach like Tailwind since you don’t even need to wait for your asset bundles to rebuild!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- app/views/shoes/hovercard.html.erb --&gt;</span>

<article>
	<p>The Spark + AI summit for 2020 is currently happening from June 22nd to June 26th. There were talks by big names in the industry like Matei Zaharia
and even by Nate Silver from fivethirtyeight.com. There were multiple topics being talked about simultaneously and it was a difficult to just
pick one to listen to as all of them seemed interesting! I took some time to listen to Tomer Shiran, the founder of the Dremio project about the origins,
the need and use cases of Apache Arrow and how they used it in Dremio alongside the Apache Arrow Gandiva.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-querying-conundrum-in-data-lakes-paradigm">The data querying conundrum in Data Lakes paradigm</h2>
<p>Data Lakes are the talk of the town today! In today’s age where data is the chief asset that companies prize, they don’t want to lose any of it
and would rather have it stored in a Data Lake even if it does not make much sense to them right now, with the prospect of it being useful at a
later point in time. That very point makes the data unwieldy.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, when your data store has vast amounts of data, querying becomes slow because it is not just that the data is big but that
transferring data over the network when you query such stores also becomes a non-trivial factor. To get around this problem, companies again
copy part of their data from the Data Lake into Data Warehousing solutions like AWS Redshift. They then construct their OLAP cubes and
aggregations on top of this for fast querying of the underlying data. The drawback of this is that the flexibility of doing anything else with
this data reduces as you copy it into the Data Warehouse. This is the problem that the folks at Dremio / Apache Arrow are trying to solve -
how do you query your data directly from the Data Lake without having to copy it anywhere else?</p>
<h2 id="dremio">Dremio</h2>
<p>The folks at Dremio claim that they have built technology to query Data Lakes with 4 to 100 times better performance than existing solutions. The
way they were able to do it is by defining and implementing a new standard - Apache Arrow, of storing data in-memory in a columnar format for efficient
operations on today’s hardware. I will talk more about Apache Arrow later in this article.</p>
<p>Following are some features that power Dremio -</p>
<h3 id="data-reflections">Data Reflections</h3>
<p>Dremio creates a view of your data, an optimized data structure that lends itself well to boost different query patterns. This data structure can
also auto refresh itself.</p>
<h3 id="columnar-cloud-cache-c3">Columnar Cloud Cache (C3)</h3>
<p>The Columnar Cloud Cache feature takes advantage of local storage (generally NVMe - non-volatile memory express) for a distributed real time
caching solution that increases the amount of read throughput and reduces the amount of data transferred over the network. It is automatic, does
not need any user involvement and caches data based on SQL query patterns, workload management and file directory structures to optimize what to
store and evict.</p>
<h3 id="predictive-pipelining">Predictive Pipelining</h3>
<p>Dremio can predict access patterns of data which reduces its query response times. Based on usage patterns of analytical workloads and their understanding
of columnar data format, the Dremio folks provide this feature wherein they fetch data only before execution engine needs it.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-dremio-and-facebooks-presto">Difference between Dremio and Facebook’s Presto</h2>
<p>Presto by Facebook is a distributed SQL engine over multiple data sources. Dremio offers more features on top of that. It sits between your
data over disparate sources and you who want an analysis of your data - it squashes the need for data warehousing solutions, OLAP cubes,
extracts and aggregations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dremio claims to offer speeds of interactive nature with data of any volume</li>
<li>It has deep integrations with some data stores and is thus able to push down some compute when queries are made over those data sources</li>
<li>It is able to show how different datasets are related to each other by creating a lineage of data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apache-arrow">Apache Arrow</h2>
<p>Apache Arrow is a specification for storing data in a columnar format in memory, serializing the metadata and for transferring data over the network.
It uses Google Flatbuffers for metadata serialization. It was born out of Dremio’s internal memory format.</p>
<p>It provides constant time random access, data adjacency for sequential scans and lends itself easily for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data)
class of instructions in modern processors.</p>
<p>It serializes data as Arrow buffers / vectors which are basically arrays of the same size with different data types. This whole package together
constitutes its schema.</p>
<h2 id="gandiva">Gandiva</h2>
<p>Gandiva is a part of Dremio which provides a high performance execution engine over Apache Arrow data buffers. Gandiva takes a sql expression,
compiles it into LLVM bytecode and translates it to machine code. To get this high performance it is written in C++.</p>
<p>Tomer wrapped up the talk on Dremio with a demo of the platform as well.</p>
<p>Go give Dremio a try!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What we pay attention to <a href="https://lithub.com/how-we-pay-attention-changes-the-very-shape-of-our-brains/" target="_blank">changes the shape of our brain</a>. Like water running through a landscape day after day after day, the neural pathways used in our work and routines cut familiar channels that give rise to the ecosystems of our mind. But paying attention is naturally selective. When we choose what to focus on, we are also choosing what to ignore.</p><p>I’ve been programming on and off since the 20th century. I see marked differences in myself, my behavior, perception, etc. when actively coding vs. not. It's finally time to investigate. What am I really paying attention to when programming? What are the implications?</p><p><i>And for the reader, what is your experience? Similar? Different? Or if you’re not a programmer, how does your discipline shape your perception?</i></p><p>When programming, I am writing the future. Every line of code is an instruction to be carried out predictably, if all goes well, a billion times over. Bits of simple logic—compounded across programs stacked on giant stacks of programs—create complex systems of logical inevitabilities.</p><p>To accomplish this, every command I write exercises a tiny mental loop:</p><ul><li><b><nobr>Step 1: </nobr></b><span>Research and understand the “inner logic” of relevant systems.</span></li><li><b><nobr>Step 2: </nobr></b><span>Formulate a hypothesis that models some new bit of logic.</span></li><li><b><nobr>Step 3: </nobr></b><span>Validate and iterate.</span></li></ul><p>Does it work? I test my code and expect an immediate response from the compiler. If yes, I move on to the next bit of logic in my day's lineup. If no, I retest my underlying arguments, breaking down my code into smaller and smaller bits. Every step of the way, my attention walks as efficiently as possible, a garden of forking yes/no paths. It's as if it were me, and not just an electric current, running through the logic gates of my computer’s circuit board.</p><p>When our brain focuses its attention, neuromodulators amplify its activated neural circuits. Like a spotlight on stage, the "speaking" actor is lit up. And likewise, the rest of the stage is intentionally dimmed. We actively suppress competing areas of the brain <code>"with slow waves in the alpha frequency band (between eight and twelve hertz), which inhibit a circuit by preventing it from developing coherent neural activity."</code></p><p>What part of my brain am I suppressing when I spend all day coding? The easy and obvious answer would be the opposite of logic—something to do with emotion. There’s certainly not much place for emotion in programming. This may influence why some of us gravitate more to front-end development—to be not so far from people. Or vice versa. But does programming suppress emotion? Let’s explore deeper.</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>I <a title="Click to expand">learned to code on LSD.</a><sup title="Click to expand">*</sup> Twenty-some years later, there are a few things I love about software development. But none more than the way it encourages and rewards mental plasticity through constant learning and unlearning.</p><p>We break systems apart in order to understand the imperative logic that glues them together. In the game of programming, the rules are entirely knowable… with enough digging. Somewhere, at some point in time, someone wrote them (and hopefully documented them). Debugging feels like the archeology of quirks, from programs layered atop older programs. There’s a real joy in discovery when we unlock a path forward. Over time, this clarity develops into confidence, and we approach systems knowing that yes, if needed, we could do the work to understand any part of this. Fortunately, this is far from what’s usually required; we rarely go deeper than the syntax and grammar of our immediate environment. But our environment still is always changing, and so we must always be learning.</p><p>The second joy of programming: I can build something out of nothing—or more specifically, out of logic and electricity. I’ve built with stone, wood, ink, plastic, etc. The freedom afforded by code is unique and specific—a kind of scalable mental scaffolding. Logically valid patterns can repeat ad infinitum into some functional space, limited for the most part only by their utility.</p><p>For me, programming enhances this way of seeing, which carries over into other areas of my life. My chess game improves drastically when actively coding. I see more clearly defined the risks and consequences of a position. Things seem more obvious, inevitable. I can break down an argument into its key dependencies, find flaws, and put it all back together efficiently optimized towards some solution. My mind begins to resemble the programs I work on.</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>My mind begins to resemble the programs I work on. The ability to build applications is empowering; but I lose power when I become just another program in the stack for people to input instructions and expect outputs. I’ve seen it throughout my career. No one wants to be a code monkey. And yet, it’s a natural consequence of specialization. Developers are inevitably busy writing code all day, not talking to people. Yes, we’re a strange bunch to begin with, and to follow the stereotype, likely more comfortable with computers than people anyways. But it seems our work reinforces our role as awkward, estranged mental laborers.</p><p>I’d thought I could hack life with the same ease I could hack a program. But life is not an abstract model of logic where outcomes are inevitable and predictable. From where I stand as a microscopic organism inside an unknown number of infinite universes, math can only solve for so much. Certainly, many of society’s rules can be gamed. My heightened logic serves me well in certain domains. But, I struggle too—there’s a price I pay for spending days programming.</p><p>It’s difficult to be exact talking about this, but I feel it strongly in 3 areas of my life:</p><ul><li><b><nobr>1.</nobr></b><span>As I get older, the health impacts—physical and mental—become more apparent. I sit (or sometimes stand) staring into an artificial sun. My body becomes disoriented by space and time. My mind gets wound up, locked into the gears of software. My eyes go dim and blurry. Hiking with the dogs for an hour at the end of every day helps, but it’s not enough. I still find myself reaching for an easy jolt back to reality, often in the form of a drink.</span></li><li><b><nobr>2.</nobr></b><span>Programming requires a quite specific mental model that makes it difficult to balance in parallel with other, more creative activities (making art, creative writing, cooking, etc.). They all struggle for my attention like children with divergent needs. It’s not so simple as time boxing activities and switching modalities, as I have to travel half way around my mind to get from one headspace to another. Too often, I end up stuck wasting my time commuting between <a title="Click to expand">competing mindsets.</a><sup title="Click to expand">*</sup></span></li><li><b><nobr>3.</nobr></b><span>Finally, and perhaps the most significant consequence: I find it challenging to relate to others when in the mindset of programming. After spending my day communicating with the compiler in encoded logic, writing commands, and expecting immediate responses, talking with a human feels slow and inefficient.</span></li></ul><p>This last point is a bit of a trope, so I want to expand. When my attention is zeroed in programming, it’s not emotion that my mind suppresses, but rather, my ability to listen, to really listen. I notice it when talking with my wife (with whom I have 10+ years of observed patterns). After a day of programming, I hear her “inputs” and I can “output” the appropriate answer. But I lose touch with her human experience. What’s not explicitly defined ceases to register. Unless I’m being intentional about it, programming often degrades my capacity for empathy.</p><p>Empathy requires a different relationship to the unknown. It enables us to “hold space” for the valid, yet truly unknowable experience of another person. It saves us from projecting our ideas of ourselves, filled with expectations and judgements, into that space. That’s not to say we don’t try to understand or pattern-match. Or that we don’t share our own experience in response. It’s just that there’s no equation that can solve for two peoples life, history, genetics, etc. We try, of course, with derivatives, approximations, and metaphor. But this is where logic ends and art begins.</p><h2>The Unknown</h2><p>So what? Programming supports my way of life, my family. These side-effects are collateral damage. But I know that by seeking to understand them, I can at least begin to address negative impacts.</p><p>Perhaps, this is just one man’s experience and not something I should generalize. But my curiosity beckons, if what I’m writing about is an experience at all common to programmers, what are the implications?</p><h3>1. Can we find a healthier, more sustainable balance with programming?</h3><p>This obviously applies to computer work in general; the physical constraints and proposed solutions are well-documented—good ergonomics, exercise, etc. But on the mental side, how do we ground ourselves during a day spent riding the proverbial lightning? Stretched across the course of a career, how does this contribute to programming being a “young person’s game,” where individual contributors as they get older burn out and switch to manager roles?</p><h3>2. Looking through the wide-angle lens: is our work’s suppression of empathy at the root of the tech-lash?</h3><p>Tech has a lossy view of the human experience. We are degraded to a few million data points. Emotion is gamified for attention, dollars, and worse. Human activity online can be easily modeled by a bot. It's common to marvel at how advanced bots and algorithms have become. But on the flip side, it reveals how shallow our models of the human experience online actually are, that a few automated clicks and some NLP can fool us.</p><p>As they say, we only improve what we measure. But we don’t measure what we don’t know. We don’t talk about empathy because it’s not a variable or a metric in any of our systems. So how can we make space for empathy in our programs as they continue to eat the world?</p><h3>3. A final thought on the future of programming</h3><p>We're entering the terrain of science-fiction here, but what would it mean to program for empathy, to encode it in our systems? Here's one possible requirement: can our programs ever account for unknowable truths?</p><p>Pe…</p></div></div>

Protesters have set fire to government installations and looted buildings throughout the country as clashes with security forces continue.

June 25, 2020 | https://www.mokacoding.com/blog/main-vs-master-xcode-12/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.mokacoding.com/blog/main-vs-master-xcode-12/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The short answer is yes.
It's a small change and easy to make, it won't disrupt your workflow, but has the possibility of making a group of people feel a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>But don't delude yourself that by doing this you're fighting racism.
You're not.</p>
<p>There's a <em>real</em> work to do out there.
Unless you make this the first step in the long journey, the branch name will be the only thing that changed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other night, I noticed that when the new Xcode 12 sets up the Git repo for a new project, it uses <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code> as the branch name.</p>
<p>I eagerly <a href="https://twitter.com/mokagio/status/1275403354324303873">tweeted</a> my discovery.</p>
<blockquote>— Gio 💻🔧📚 (@mokagio) <a href="https://twitter.com/mokagio/status/1275403354324303873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>I woke up to more than a hundred mentions.
People got very passionate about it, the haters and the trolls were unleashed.</p>
<p>I didn't reply to the tweets.
Twitter is not the place to have constructive conversations on difficult topics, as many of the comments show. The medium is too constrained for deep thinking.</p>
<p>I'd like to say a few words here, though.</p>
<p>Moving away from the name <code>master</code> in repositories is a recent trend it tech.
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/15/github_replaces_master_with_main/">GitHub is working on a similar change</a> and so is <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, where I work.
WordPress.org has already <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/18/proposal-update-all-git-repositories-to-use-main-instead-of-master/">opted to use <code>trunk</code> </a> instead.</p>
<p>The topic of language in software development is older, though.
For example, 6 years ago the Django web framework <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692">replaced all occurrences of "master/slave" with "leader/follower"</a>.</p>
<p>Does changing a few names in your codebase "end racism"?
No.</p>
<p>Is it going to have a meaningful impact on society or even just tech?
No.</p>
<p>Is it just theater, doing <em>something</em> just to show that something is being done? Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>Is it something worth doing?
Yes.</strong></p>
<p>It's not a matter of being politically correct.
It's a matter of building a more inclusive environment, one step at a time.</p>
<p>The words you use make a difference in the results you get.
Marketers know it well, using the right wording can make or break the sale numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/pryzant2017sigir.pdf">A Stanford study</a> shows that in Japan, products sell best if their advertising uses polite language and words that invoke cultural tradition.
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12637">Another study</a> shows that if you want to encourage girls into STEM subjects, using a statement like "girls are as good as boy at math" will actually achieve the opposite result, reinforcing the stereotype that boys are better than girls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n some ways, implicit messages might shape beliefs more powerfully than explicit messages that express the same ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Using a more inclusive language is the first step to build an inclusive world.
Not the only step, not the most impactful one, but a step nonetheless.</strong></p>
<p>And if this argument is not enough for you, what about just <del>not being an asshole</del> being kind?
<em>See how I changed my language to make the message positive there?</em></p>
<p>Rob Napier <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoaphony/status/1275494069024817155">puts it well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone tells you that a term is offensive, you should start with the assumption that they're correct, and behave accordingly, unless you have some good reason to think it's in bad faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everybody has the same background as you do.
Just because something does not affect you, it doesn't mean it does not affect other people.
How would you like it if words that are offensive to you were thrown around all the time?
Do you really think you could just <em>toughen up</em> and move on?</p>
<p>Religions across history have a common thread in the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">golden rule</a>: "<em>Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated</em>".</p>
<p>The beauty of the golden rule is that there's nothing mystical to it.
You don't need to be religious to appreciate it's effectiveness.</p>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog">Thoughtbot</a> went through something similar when they renamed their popular library from <code>factory_girl</code> to <code>factory_bot</code>.
The name was <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/pull/943/files">meant as a nod to the factory method and the object mother patterns</a>, but the female gender in such a male-dominated space as tech made some people uncomfortable.
They <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/factory_bot#why">eventually changed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We concluded that, even though not everyone agreed, lack of concern from many shouldn't prevent the name being changed.
Being clever shouldn't be favored at the expense of others feeling marginalized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If such a small change as <code>git -m main</code> can have a positive impact, even if little, in the work life of some people with a concrete reason to ask for it, why not just doing it and move on?</p>
<p>But don't pat yourself in the back just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Changing from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> doesn't mean you're fighting against racism and inequality.</strong>
It is but a single step, and an easy one, too.</p>
<p>The cynical will say that this is only theater, smoke and mirrors.
If that's as far as you'll go, than that's true, it was just theater.</p>
<p><strong>But maybe, just maybe, we can make this tiny change be the first of many.</strong></p>
<p>The next one is <a href="https://anygoodthing.com/2020/06/14/what-is-racism/">educating ourselves</a>.
Another one is trying to understand <a href="https://dev.to/afrodevgirl/replacing-master-with-main-in-github-2fjf">other people's point of view</a>.
And the one after that is changing our companies from the bottom up by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyiMathkUrQ">lending our privilege</a>.</p>
<p>Just don't go on Twitter and feed the trolls.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-20">
		
	
	<div>
		
<p>Some commenters (/u/coderintherye chain notably) on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23630201">HN post</a> of the <a href="https://thinkingagriculture.io/what-silicon-valley-doesnt-understand-about-agriculture/">original article</a> brought up good points that I wanted to expand on and provide some additional context. Also for clarification: although farming is truly global, most ‘farming’ I refer to pertains to the United States (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States">which is an agriculture juggernaut</a>), but in my experience should reasonably translate across agriculture zones (pending equivalent laws and climatic factors).</p>



<p><strong><em>There is ample VC money for Ag startups</em></strong></p>



<p>The original intention of the article wasn’t to bemoan the lack of capital available for <a href="https://agiowa.com/portfolio/">founders focused on agriculture</a> (there is actually plenty of capital–check out <a href="https://agfundernews.com/">AgFunderNews</a> for examples of successful raises). Instead, it is a recommendation for anyone entering the space to understand the industry and its history to harness existing synergies rather than try and swim upstream. Watching capital go to ‘solved’ problems is painful, because there are many opportunities for a unicorn ag startup if aimed in the correct space. Vertical farming for non-vegetables (or fruits) is likely dead-on-pitch. Yes, vertical farming <em>is</em> and <em>could be</em> successful, but those markets are very specific and probably 10x smaller than people think. Nice businesses no doubt, but not market shaping behemoths VCs are after. Agriculture is rightfully a commodity and the market will brutalize ideas/companies that can’t turn a profit. One bad year (droughts in 2011 and 2012 in the US Midwest) from external forces can absolutely put farmers out of business. Indoor farming has all of the risks of outdoor ag–and more! Indoor farming requires water (whose source can dry up and get shut off unexpectedly, just like a drought), has pests, and requires artificial lighting (power outage for 5 days? Uh oh). Herbicides (and sometimes pesticides) are actually an example of innovation pre-SV. Alternate technologies (i.e mechanical) didn’t work or were uneconomical for the time period; thus, chemical solutions seemed to thrive (glyphosate/glufosinate resistant corn/soy/wheat/cotton/sugar beets &amp; <a href="https://agrilife.org/lubbock/files/2020/02/BtTraitTable_FEB_2020.pdf">BT resistance for insects</a>). I predict in next 5-20 years we see that flip, where chemical and biological solutions fall out in favor of mechanized solutions (who wouldn’t want a semi-autonomous robot pulling weeds in fields in favor of a chemical solution that is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bayer-reaches-10-5-billion-settlement-roundup-cancer-lawsuits-n1232026">open to litigation</a>)? We just have too little understanding of 2nd and 3rd order effects of disrupting nature at this scale (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49660-6">gene drives included</a>, as promising as they appear) using these incredibly effective chemicals.</p>



<p><strong><em>Financing in the Heartland</em></strong></p>



<p>I won’t speak of financing agricultural operations in a municipality not located in the United States, as even understanding the US situation takes time and effort. Let’s be clear though: Most farmers <em>need</em> to borrow capital just to operate for a given year (hence, there is a note called an ‘operating loan’) and financing agriculture operations is more and more important as the size of farms increases. They buy seed, fertilizer, feed, chemicals, etc. to be able to produce an output to then (hopefully) sell at a profit–all to rinse and repeat. Buying big expensive new tractors ($300k+ USD), buildings to store the machines, grain storage, fencing, animal houses–all generally require a loan. Because of the huge cost to purchase these necessities, financing institutions generally need to have a <em>very</em> thorough understanding of the operation (Only farm 160 acres of corn,soy,or wheat? Good luck buying equipment). So bankers have become very good (not perfect) at evaluating and swaying farming practices to ensure maximum likelihood of repayment. Seriously, check of the used auction prices of ag machinery sometime–<a href="https://www.bigiron.com/Lots/2011JohnDeere8335RMFWDTractor-3">this tractor</a> is 10 years old and commands the price of a new Tesla. Is ag financing a place that needs disruption? Likely no because ag lending has evolved hand-in-hand in rural communities where agricultural production is the predominant industry. Because they evolved with ag, they likely have already captured the +EV that startups tend to seek because their very existence depends on it. So where <em>are</em> the value proposition? I know nothing of their founding, but the previous auction link is from <a href="https://www.bigiron.com/">Big Iron Auctions</a> and those founders likely understood ag (“hey, there is a robust secondary market for farm machinery”) and created on-line version of it–with what appears to be great success. I’d imagine these on-line secondary markets exist in Brazil and Eastern Europe given there agriculture exposure. </p>



<p><strong><em>Success Stories</em></strong></p>



<p>There are some truly incredible examples of engineering and innovation in agriculture that focus on the mechanization and scale <em>that already exists</em>. Transplanting vegetables in the Central Valley (CA) used to be labor intensive–<a href="https://www.planttape.com/">this brilliant solution solved that</a>. Auto-steer <a href="https://www.fieldbee.com/blog/fieldbee-tractor-autosteer-versus-other-systems/">systems</a> that leverage machinery that already exists. Sometimes the innovation is statistical/computation (<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-animal-021815-111422">genomic prediction has revolutionized dairy cattle</a>) Starting businesses is hard and agriculture is no different.</p>



<p>Stay away from vertical farming–unless you plan on growing saffron or figure out a way to cultivate morel mushrooms!</p>

Not moving. For hours. Why? Because YouTube influencer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA">MrBeast</a> asked them to.</p><p><strong>Wait. Can you put that in the form of a question?</strong></p><p>Sure: What would you pay to get your brand top-of-mind with hundreds of thousands of Americans?&nbsp;</p><p>MrBeast is betting $25,000 is a good round figure. On June 30th at 3 PM ET, thousands of people across the country will compete to win $25,000. The contest: Be the last person to take their finger off their phone.</p><p><strong>You’re kidding?</strong> No. I’m drop-digit serious. And so is the marketplace of ideas. &nbsp; According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/app/1508022053/">App Annie</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finger-on-the-app/id1508022053">Finger on the App</a> is the #1 free app in the iOS app store, with over 3,000 reviews. You can find articles on the contest in TechCrunch, Mashable and Forbes.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies pay in the billions to be on the top of the iOS app store. MrBeast did it for $25,000 — plus the price of the app, of course.&nbsp;</p><p>This type of press would cost millions of dollars. Companies pay billions of dollars to try to be on the top of the iOS app store. MrBeast did it for $25,000.&nbsp;</p><p>MrBeast is an outlast competition, well, beast. Last December, he gave away $1,000,000. The contest? Be the last person to take your hand off $1,000,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s pause to appreciate the irony here. In a time when everyone’s competing for people's attention via the utility of an app, MrBeast captured everyone's attention via an app that has no utility whatsoever. In fact, the app renders your phone unusable. During the contest, you can’t use your iPhone as a phone — or to text! (OMG! Is anything sacred?)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why do these contests work?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People, Americans especially, love free stuff. But don't take my word for it. Take the neuroeconomics professor’s word for it. <a href="https://cm-commerce.com/academy/what-science-says-about-discounts-promotions-and-free-offers/">In a 2012 study</a> for Coupons.com, Dr. Paul Zak discovered:&nbsp;</p><p>"Coupon recipients who got a $10 voucher experienced a 38% rise in oxytocin levels and were 11% happier than those who did not receive a coupon. Furthermore, their respiration rates dropped 32%, heart rates decreased by 5% and sweat levels were reportedly 20 times lower than their peers. Consequently, they felt more relaxed and less stressed."</p><p>People who get free stuff are happier than people who don't. (And they perspire less, which makes their friends happier.)</p><p><strong>Why do we compare ourselves to others?</strong></p><p>"Individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others,” notes <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/social-comparison-theory">Leon Festinger</a>, “in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self."&nbsp;</p><p>People don't care about public opinion polls. They care about their peers. Or, more accurately, they care about how they compare to their peers. They want to make more money, have nicer things, and be in stronger relationships than their peers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Status is a very big part of it. They want to win. That's part of the motivation. We're all competitive in our own way,” says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/your-money/inside-the-minds-of-the-ultrawealthy.html">psychologist Brad Klontz</a>, in the NY Times. “It’s part of our tribal DNA. If you think about tribal societies, the person who has the most power also has the most access to resources, and they can protect and provide for their family. The closer others are to that leader, the safer they feel. It's the pursuit that brings them happiness … The money is a side effect, but it's not what is giving them joy."</p><p>Am I alone here thinking how sweet it would be to know 15 of my friends were also in the MrBeast contest, and I won? I’d list this prize alone in the awards section of my resume.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Build Community to Capture Attention</strong></p><p>MrBeast has gamified the giveaway. <strong>The formula?</strong> Create a contest, reward your fans, go viral and repeat. Fans love the idea of being part of something bigger than themselves. On June 30th, hundreds of thousands of people will have their finger on an app all for MrBeast.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s that type of attention worth?&nbsp;</p><p>A hell of a lot more than $25,000, I assure you.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thanks to </em><a href="https://twitter.com/randaldoane"><em>Randal Doane</em></a><em> for coaching me through this essay.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

June 25, 2020 | https://snake-ci.com/blog/go2go-stream/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://snake-ci.com/blog/go2go-stream/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<div>
										
										<p>The Go team recently released a new post in the Go blog called
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">Â«The Next Step in GenericsÂ»</a> and updated the design draft on
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">Â«Type ParametersÂ»</a> (a long one).</p>

<p>In the current post I’m going to describe how to port Java’s Stream to Go 2 Generics.</p>

<p>Let’s make it straightforward â€” define the Stream:</p>

<pre><code>type Stream(type Type) struct {
	slice    []Type
	parallel bool
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we declare a new type using type parameter <code>Type</code> with underlying slice <code>[]Type</code>.</p>

<p>And let’s have a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type)(slice []Type) *Stream(Type) {
	return &amp;Stream(Type){
		slice: slice,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter <code>(type Type)</code> after name of function and in type declaration is Type Parameter.
The type parameter is required whenever we are going to use generics.</p>

<p>Now we can implement core functions of a typical stream:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Reduce</li>
<li>ForEach</li>
<li>Collect</li>

<li><p>AnyMatch/AllMatch/NoneMatch</p>

<pre><code>func (stream *Stream(Type)) Filter(predicate func(Type) bool) *Stream(Type) {
	filtered := []Type{}
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		if predicate(item) {
			filtered = append(filtered, item)
		}
	}
	stream.slice = filtered
	return stream
}

func Map(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(Type) R) *Stream(R) {
	slice := make([]R, len(stream.slice))
	for i, item := range stream.slice {
		slice[i] = predicate(item)
	}
	return Of(slice)
}

func Reduce(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(R, Type) R) R {
	var result R
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		result = predicate(result, item)
	}
	return result
}

func (stream *Stream(Type)) ForEach(predicate func(Type)) *Stream(Type) {
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		predicate(item)
	}
	return stream
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that Map and Reduce functions are not declared on <code>Stream(Type)</code>. It’s one of unsolved problems of current generics
design draft â€” parametrized methods are not permitted.</p>

<p>It means that we can have a function that receives type <code>A</code> and returns type <code>B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func foo(type A, B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<p>But we can’t declare a parametrized method on type <code>Struct(A)</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>func (s Struct(A)) foo(type B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>This design draft does not permit methods to declare type parameters that are specific to the method. The receiver may
have type parameters, but the method not add any type parameters.
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md#no-parameterized-methods">Quote from the updated design draft</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s time for the cherry on top â€” <code>Stream(Type).Collect()</code>.</p>

<p>The signature of Collect function will be pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>func Collect(type Type, Col)(
	stream *Stream(Type),
	collector collector.Collector(Type, Col),
) Col
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that now we have two type parameters â€” one for original type that was used for creating a stream and another one
for resulting collection.</p>

<p>Here is a interface for a typical collector that consists of four functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Supply()</code> â€” a function that creates and returns a new result container.</li>
<li><code>Accumulate()</code> â€” a function that folds a value into a mutable result container.</li>
<li><code>Combine()</code> â€” a function that accepts two partial results and merges them. This is going to be used only in parallel mode.</li>

<li><p><code>Finish()</code> â€” while in Java this method converts from an intermediate type to the final result type, but in order to save
the simplicity of the implementation, it will return the same type.</p>

<pre><code>type Collector(type Type, Col) interface {
	Supply() Col
	Accumulate(Col, Type) Col
	Finish(Col) Col
	Combine(Col, Col) Col
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have the interface, we need an implementation. But since we want to allow developers to add
their own implementations without declaring new types, we need a constructor that will accept functions, think of it
like <code>http.HandleFunc()</code> which is often used to wrap functions and returns <code>http.Handler</code>.</p>

<p>We will declare a new constructor for <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> like we did for <code>Stream(Type)</code> that will return unexported
implementation of <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> that will just call the given functions:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type, Col)(
	supply func() Col,
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col,
	finish func(Col) Col,
	combine func(Col, Col) Col,
) Collector(Type, Col) {
	return impl(Type, Col){
		supply:     supply,
		accumulate: accumulate,
		finish:     finish,
		combine:    combine,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we also have to specify <code>(Type, Col)</code> for <code>Collector</code> even though we specified it later <code>impl(Type, Col)</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>impl(Type, Col)</code> type is going to be a holder of functions that implements the <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>type impl(type Type, Col) struct {
	supply     func() Col
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col
	finish     func(Col) Col
	combine    func(Col, Col) Col
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Supply() Col {
	return collector.supply()
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Accumulate(collection Col, item Type) Col {
	return collector.accumulate(collection, item)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Finish(collection Col) Col {
	if collector.finish == nil {
		return collection
	}
	return collector.finish(collection)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Combine(collection1, collection2 Col) Col {
	return collector.combine(collection1, collection2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we’re good, now let’s declare a simple collector that is going to convert a <code>Type</code> to <code>Map[Key]Value</code> â€” <code>ToMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func ToMap(type Type interface{}, Key comparable, Value interface{})(
	mapper func(Type) (Key, Value),
	accumulator func(Value, Value) Value,
) Collector(Type, map[Key]Value) {
	return Of(
		func() map[Key]Value {
			return map[Key]Value{}
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value, item Type) map[Key]Value {
			key, value := mapper(item)
			now, _ := table[key]
			table[key] = accumulator(now, value)
			return table
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			return table
		},
		func(table1, table2 map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			for k2, v2 := range table2 {
				v1, _ := table1[k2]
				table1[k2] = accumulator(v1, v2)
			}
			return table1
		},
	)
}
</code></pre>

<p>An interesting thing about this function is that while it has three separated type parameters, it returns
<code>Collector(Type, map[Key]Value)</code> that uses only two type parameters.</p>

<p>Note that we need to specify Type Constraint for Key <code>comparable</code> in order to use it as key of a map otherwise it just
wouldn’t work.</p>

<p><code>ToMap</code> expects two functions on input:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mapper <code>func(Type) (Key, Value)</code> â€” receives an original element and returns two values: first one is going to be used as key
of the map, and the second one is going to be used as the value of the map[key]</li>
<li>Accumulator <code>func(now Value, update Value) Value</code> â€” receives current value of map[key] and new value <code>update</code> that have to be
somehow accumulated into <code>now</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see how it will work out on practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Declare a simple type that will describe a movie and a score that a user gave to the movie:</p>

<pre><code>type MovieVote struct {
	Name  string
	Score int
}
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Create a stream of slice of some movies and user votes:</p>

<pre><code>items := stream.Of(
	[]MovieVote{
		{Name: "A", Score: 1},
		{Name: "A", Score: 2},
		{Name: "B", Score: 9},
		{Name: "B", Score: 10},
		{Name: "B", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
		{Name: "C", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
	},
)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Now let’s convert them into <code>map[Name]SumOfScore</code>:</p>

<pre><code>result := stream.Collect(
	items,
	collector.ToMap(MovieVote, string, int)(
		func(movie MovieVote) (string, int) {
			return movie.Name, movie.Score
		},
		func(total, score int) int {
			return total + score
		},
	),
)
fmt.Println(result)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The mapper returns name as key and score as value</li>
<li>The accumulator sums total and current score</li>
</ul>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>map[A:3 B:27 C:22]
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, this collector also works in Parallel mode, check it out in the source code:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><hr><p itemprop="description">I don't use social media often, that's by design. I know if I start using it regularly, I will become addicted to it. So, imagine my surprise when on one Sunday afternoon I found out that I spent the entire day doing nothing but watching videos on YouTube.</p><p>The saddest thing is that I didn’t even remember what I was watching. It was just a clockwork for my brain at that point. Wake up, open YouTube, watch a video, continue watching videos.</p><p>I write this blog on another Sunday afternoon, almost three months after, to say that I watched YouTube for just 10 minutes this week to watch a work-related video that a colleague sent.</p><p>I’m a little proud of myself, to tell the truth.</p><p>This is a log of everything I did to overcome this addiction. If it helped me, it might help someone else too.</p><h2 id="how-and-why-i-became-addicted">How and Why I Became Addicted</h2><p>YouTube is a community where billions of people share their talents, interests and findings with you.</p><p><strong>That’s the hook.</strong></p><p>The <strong>real</strong> YouTube is a billion-dollar company where hundreds of researchers and designers manipulate an algorithm to deliver a low-quality video to you.</p><p>I thought about why I was addicted for a long time. It basically was three things,</p><ul><li>Types of videos I watch</li><li>YouTube’s Algorithm</li><li>YouTube’s Story</li></ul><h3 id="types-of-videos-i-watch">Types of videos I watch</h3><h4 id="gaming-30">Gaming (30%)</h4><p>This one was easy to justify for me, I like watching someone be good at something. Until I realized that this was a passive way of thinking about it.</p><p>I’m not raising my skill by watching this, so what’s the point? The only way I could get better at video games is to play it more, not by watching someone else play it.</p><h4 id="self-help-30">Self Help (30%)</h4><p><strong>Biggest trap of them all.</strong> Productivity, Self Help, Motivational channels might seem to have a good agenda on the onset but they can’t profit if you actually improve yourself.</p><p>Most of the YouTubers in this category are good people at heart. But they know that 90% of the people watching them won’t improve anything in their life. They just like the feeling of improving themselves.</p><p>Every time you watch one of the self-help videos, your brain plays a trick on you. It makes you think that you are actually improving yourself but when in reality you are just actually watching a video that you will forget in 40 minutes.</p><p>You will come for more when that rush is over. And YouTube tells them to create more videos quickly for us to consume.</p><p>For quick reference these are the only things they will say to you from now until eternity:</p><ul><li>Self Help YouTubers: Take care of yourself</li><li>Productivity YouTubers: Organize your life for deep work</li><li>Motivational YouTubers: Never stop the Hustle (This will lead to burnout by the way.)</li></ul><p>Ironically most of these YouTubers recommend you to read a book.</p><h4 id="design-and-development-20">Design and Development (20%)</h4><p>I’m a professional web designer, so it’s important for me to keep up with the latest developments in my field. Of course, that’s what I told myself.</p><p>Things always change but YouTube is not a place to capture it. YouTube videos seem to be the fast-food sector of the industry. Fast to the point but not impactful and everlasting.</p><p>I’ve found that written content like</p><ul><li>Blog Posts</li><li>Documentation</li><li>Best Practices</li><li>Newsletters</li><li>Case Studies</li></ul><p>are often more informative and educational. They let you,</p><ul><li>Read at your own pace</li><li>Accessible and Developer Friendly</li><li>Most of them are intended to be everlasting or updated frequently</li></ul><p>One might argue developer tutorials are inherently good and I agree, but I usually get a better flow in my work from written tutorials.</p><p>These are mostly for entertainment, but as I distance myself from these more and more I find them to be passive entertainment.</p><p>Netflix has a collection of marvelously produced entertainment that will take my entire lifetime to watch. Why should I settle for this glut?</p><h4 id="pointless-internet-drama-10">Pointless Internet Drama (10%)</h4><p>This was the cone of shame for me, I liked reality TV, YouTubers fighting with each other and mostly pointless drama. I was thinking about why I like this, and then a quote someone said came to me,</p><p>Don’t live on someone else’s life.</p><p>I was projecting. I have a simple life with no problems. So, I liked watching other people have problems. I thought I was superior to them in some way and that made me feel good.</p><p>Of course, I was the idiot watching videos while they simply got paid and went home.</p><h3 id="youtubes-algorithm">YouTube’s Algorithm</h3><p>Whenever I open YouTube, it shows me a carefully chosen list of videos that interests me. It’s a combination of what I recently liked, latest videos from the creators I like, trending videos from my location, and cute animals.</p><p><strong>It’s impossible not to click on any of these.</strong></p><p>YouTube’s algorithm is very powerful at this point, probably the most sophisticated recommendation engine in the world. You simply can’t win it.</p><p>You can, however, not participate in its game. Some steps you can take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Do not <code>smash that like button</code> on any videos.</strong></p><p>If you want to see a video again, download it to your drive. The YouTube video can be removed, blocked, or altered but you can always have what you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not <code>hit that bell icon</code>.</strong></p><p>Voluntarily having more notifications on your phone is the first step to becoming mindless and have other people dictate where you spend your time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pause Watched History and Search History.</strong></p><p>Again, download important videos. 98% of what you watch is not worth it and the other 2% can easily be searched again.</p></li></ul><p>Clear watch history, remove previously liked videos, clear out your comments. Do not give any indication to YouTube on what you like.</p><p>I even ran a puppeteer (automated script) to remove all the videos from my recommendation but it just pops back up. The <code>Not Interested</code> option is not real.</p><p><strong>Ultimately, be utilitarian on what you want.</strong></p><p>If you want to learn <em>How to Tie a Tie</em>, search for it, learn it and close it. Don’t needlessly subscribe, like or engage in any way.</p><h3 id="youtubes-story">YouTube’s Story</h3><p>A brand’s story is what you want other people to tell about your brand. YouTube’s story is,</p><p>YouTube is a community of people giving free information and entertainment.</p><ul><li><p><strong>YouTube is not a community.</strong></p><p>Individual creators may create a community. But YouTube is a company that wants nothing but profits.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube is not free.</strong></p><p>Nothing Google does is free.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube gives low-quality information and entertainment.</strong></p><p>Only 5% of its millions of videos are actually helpful. Don’t take that burden of sifting through all that to find something you might like.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-i-overcame-youtube">How I Overcame YouTube</h2><p>Here are some simple and actionable steps that I took over the months,</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cancelling YouTube Premium</strong></p><p>If you get pissed off at the ads like I do, then it’s good. You will quit the video soon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn off notifications</strong></p><p>Taylor Swift’s new music video is not that important to notify you. No one should have the right to disturb you anytime they want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reducing subscriptions</strong></p><p>Go through your subscription list and remove anyone who you don’t need in your life anymore.

<p>📘 Check our <strong>step-by-step tutorial and screencast</strong> on how to easily deploy on <strong>AWS</strong> a single-node <strong>Firecracker cloud</strong> integrated with the <strong>Docker Hub</strong> marketplace:</p>



<figure><a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045029871-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Cloud-Integrated-with-Docker-Hub-on-AWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FC_AWS.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>
</div></div>



<div><div>
<p>Application container technologies, like <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Docker (opens in a new tab)">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kubernetes (opens in a new tab)">Kubernetes</a>, are becoming the de facto leading standards for packaging, deploying and managing applications with increased levels of agility and efficiency. Kubernetes is widely used for the orchestration of containers on clusters, offering features for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>However, <strong>Kubernetes doesn’t necessarily work for every single use case</strong> nor solves all container management-related challenges an organization might face. Just to put an example, its support for multi-tenancy is actually quite limited, and it cannot guarantee perfectly secure isolation between tenants. The only way to run Kubernetes is by providing different teams with their own clusters. Upgrading clusters and patching vulnerabilities is not a quick and easy task, which in the end requires to build an <strong>expensive full-time admin team</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Moreover, Kubernetes does not offer cloud-like self-service provision features for users, nor accounting and advanced authorization features for administrators. Cloud providers and cloud management tools, like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Amazon EKS (opens in a new tab)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google Kubernetes Engine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine" target="_blank">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a>, try to bridge these gaps by offering <strong>managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service platforms</strong>. What these solutions do is to add an extra control layer that ends up <strong>increasing management complexity, resource consumption, and associated costs</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>
</div></div></div>



<h2>OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</h2>



<p>The new <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework” (opens in a new tab)" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> brings new exciting features to the container orchestration ecosystem by providing an <strong>innovative open source solution</strong> for organizations that need to build and manage a secure, self-service, multi-tenant cloud for serverless computing. Users of an OpenNebula cloud can now easily run isolated containers without the need to provision and manage servers or additional control layers, thus allowing them to focus on designing and building their applications instead of managing the underlying infrastructure. OpenNebula’s <strong>pioneering approach towards container orchestration</strong> integrates two main technologies: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AWS Firecracker (opens in a new tab)" href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" target="_blank">AWS Firecracker</a> as the VMM that provisions, manages and orchestrates micro-VMs, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Docker Hub (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> as the marketplace for application containers from which users can obtain and seamlessly <strong>deploy Docker images as micro-VMs</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>AWS Firecracker is an open source technology that makes use of KVM to launch lightweight Virtual Machines—called micro-VMs—for <strong>enhanced security, workload isolation, and resource efficiency</strong>. It is widely used by AWS as part of their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fargate (opens in a new tab)">Fargate</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Lambda (opens in a new tab)">Lambda</a> services. Firecracker opens up a whole new world of possibilities as the foundation for serverless solutions that need to quickly deploy critical applications as containers while keeping them in secure isolation. With the recent integration of Firecracker as a <strong>new supported virtualization technology</strong>, OpenNebula provides now an innovative solution to the classic dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>OpenNebula’s integration of Docker Hub as a new native marketplace provides users with immediate access to <strong>Docker Hub official images</strong>. Through this integration Docker images can be easily imported into an OpenNebula cloud, following a process similar to the way in which the OpenNebula Public Marketplace operates. The OpenNebula context packages are installed during the import process so, once an image is imported, it becomes fully functional (including auto IP configuration, SSH key management and custom scripts). The Docker Hub marketplace also creates a new VM template associated with the imported image. This template can be customized by the user (e.g. adding the desired kernel, tuning specific parameters, etc.).</p>

<h2>An Enterprise Cloud for Containerized Applications</h2>



<p>OpenNebula brings to the container world a series of unique features to <strong>build your own enterprise cloud for serverless computing</strong>. Its unique approach speeds up the deployment of <strong>containerized applications and multi-tier services</strong> within your development workflow. In particular, OpenNebula provides:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fast startup times</strong>: With OpenNebula you can start containers in seconds by deploying them as Firecracker micro-VMs, without the need to provision and maintain Dockerized hosts or complex Kubernetes infrastructures.</li><li><strong>Direct access to applications</strong>:&nbsp; Deploying a container as a micro-VM allows your container to directly access your networks through the Firecracker micro-VM’s IP address. Furthermore, the micro-VM can be accessed via SSH and VNC by providing interactive modes that help with application development and troubleshooting.</li><li><strong>Hypervisor-level security: </strong>OpenNebula guarantees that your containerized application to run within a Firecracker micro-VM which, in turn, provides VM-grade security and isolation in a multi-tenant environment while preserving the efficiency of lightweight containers.</li><li><strong>Persistent storage: </strong>OpenNebula’s datastores can be used as persistent data volumes for containers by attaching them to your Firecracker micro-VMs. Read-only configuration or data files can be provided by using the OpenNebula file datastore, which can be used by the application within the micro-VM.</li><li><strong>Network access: </strong>Virtual Networks defined within an OpenNebula cloud (i.e. IPv4, IPv6, Dual Stack, Ethernet) can be easily configured so that containerized applications get direct access to the internet without requiring additional components (e.g. ingress controllers, load balancers, etc.). With OpenNebula Virtual Routers it is also possible to connect different virtual networks, allowing applications and Virtual Machines attached to different virtual networks to communicate with each other. It is possible to use security groups for ensuring network security for containers applications.</li><li><strong>Application horizontal scaling</strong>: Application deployed as complex, multi-tier services can be scaled up and down “manually” but also (via the OneFlow component) in an automatic manner, based on user-defined metrics and pre-defined criteria. An <em>init</em> script can be defined to send application metrics to OneGate, OpenNebula’s metadata server.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Complete multi-tenant environments</strong> with ACLs, users, groups, resource UNIX-like permissions and VDCs, in which cloud admins can easily adapt OpenNebula to their organization’s infrastructure and DevOps requirements and set up independent sets of resources for specific purposes or groups of users (i.e. development, testing, integration and production).</li><li><strong>Geo-distributed applications</strong>: Thanks to its elastic cloud infrastructure feature (OneProvision), OpenNebula allows to build on-demand geo-distributed infrastructures for execution of containerized applications at the Edge.</li></ul>







<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Although many IT departments providing container execution services have decided to implement their <strong>DevOps requirements on top of Kubernetes</strong>, that doesn’t mean that betting only on one horse is the wisest thing to do. Organizations requiring container orchestration capabilities should first of all state what their main objective is, and be careful not to make apples to oranges comparisons or to fall into <strong>unexpected costs or vendor lock-ins</strong>. Kubernetes is a <strong>very complex and demanding technology</strong>, and—temporary fashions aside—other technologies may actually be the best solution for some use cases.<br></p>



<p>Some of the features provided by Kubernetes (such as its declarative model, self healing, automated rollout and rollbacks, secret and configuration management, service discovery and load balancing) make it ideal for companies that need complete container orchestration services for the deployment and management of containerized workflows in a production environment. Yet, these organizations have to be able to cope with <strong>high operational costs</strong> if what they want is to build and manage a <strong>corporate Kubernetes deployment</strong>.<br></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenNebula (opens in a new tab)" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">OpenNebula</a>, on the other hand, becomes an ideal solution for companies that need to build <strong>multi-tenant Container-as-a-Service environments</strong>, but with <strong>lower operational costs</strong>. In this way, users and business units can develop and deploy applications easily and very fast, without their organizations having to manage dockerized hosts or complex orchestration infrastructures such as Kubernetes or OpenShift. With the release of its version 5.12 “Firework”, OpenNebula has become a real alternative for implementing an <strong>agile and serverless cloud paradigm for containerized workloads</strong> in production environments 🚀</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>After 8 years of using Apple computers (mac mini and multiple MacBooks), I decided to say "Farewell" to Apple.</p>
<p>The quality of both software and hardware when it comes to their mobile computers went downhill in recent years.<br>
Butterfly keyboard issues, old CPUs (compared to what other manufacturers put in their machines), quite limited of memory (until latest iteration of 13" MacBooks Pro it was impossible to get more than 16GB of RAM), software issues with Catalina (audio glitches, random freezes, random reboots) - all of that led me to the point where I decided to sell my 2015-version of MacBook Pro (I still have one MBPro from 2019 that I'm using for work at current company, and I still need to live with this failing system)</p>
<p>When I had switched from 2012 mac mini to PC desktop three years ago (there was no reasonable alternative from Apple on the horizon) I've told myself I'm going to stick with Apple for mobile computing (and I partly do, I still don't see any alternatives to iPhone and iPad) based on my previous experiences with Linux on a laptop. But I decided to give it a try.<br>
When I previously used Linux on a laptop, it was between 2008 and 2011, and it was a mess - battery life was a joke compared to what I could achieve with Windows, constant issues with suspending and hibernation, failing wireless network card.<br>
That was when I joined Apple cult. It was quite the opposite - long battery life, beautiful UI, seamless integration between different products, quite good performance, lot of great apps. Too bad it's only partially true now.  I want to share my journey about looking for a suitable replacement for MacBook Pro in 2020, and I need to make clear that my needs for computing might not be usual. But hey, we're talking about MacBook <em>Pro</em>, and I mean this should be aimed at professionals. I'm 100% sure many people will be happy with their Macs.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-6 hours of battery life</li>
<li>As much memory as possible. I use a lot of Docker containers with memory-hungry applications. And I use Chrome, so there's no such thing as too much memory</li>
<li>Fast disks</li>
<li>Ideally - matte display</li>
<li>Screen no bigger than 14"</li>
<li>Reliably working Wi-Fi card</li>
</ul>
<p>You may think many products will meet these criteria, but you couldn't be more wrong.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
 
<center><span lang="EN-US">By Gerard ’t Hooft</span><p><img src="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/animate.gif"></p>
</center><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="6">Once upon a 
time ...</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">there was a civilization, not unlike 
ours today, that had enjoyed tremendous recent advances in technology. One of 
their remarkable achievements was the invention of a new device. It was called 
the <b><i>automobile</i></b>.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;The first automobiles had engines that 
worked on steam and coal. It took about three minutes to start the engine, and 
the automobile did not yet move very fast, having a maximum speed of 30 km per 
hour. Still, this was faster than people could walk, and so it was considered a 
real improvement. People, on average, now took only some 30 minutes to travel 
from their homes to work, and everyone was happy with this great new enrichment 
of their lives.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;Then further technological advances 
came. The new automobiles had a roof, and were equipped with windows; they now 
had lights, claxons and light signals. The fuel for the engines was replaced by 
gasoline, and the maximum speed greatly improved, to 60 km/hour. The engines 
would start much quicker. However, the machines had also become more complex, 
and, for safety reasons, it was decided that before you start riding this 
vehicle, the proper working of the lights, the claxon, the light signals, the 
steering wheel, the breaks and the transparency of the windows had to be 
checked. 
<img src="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/cars.jpg" width="378" height="151">All this checking would take about four minutes. Adding one minute to 
start the engine, this meant that after you'd step inside your automobile, you 
would not start moving before another five minutes went by. The breaks would be 
tested regularly also during the ride, and so the average time to get to your 
work had actually increased to 40 minutes.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;Then many more mighty improvements 
came. The maximum speed was increased to 200 km/hour. The engine could start up 
instantly. The automobile manufacturers made use of all these marvelous advances 
to build in many more interesting features. Your automobile would now have 
electrically adjustable windows, rear view mirrors, spare wheels, powered 
brakes, automatic gear shift, safety belts, door locks, radio and TV, a 
telephone set, an alarm clock and other gadgets, such as many automatic checking 
devices to ensure the proper working of the engines. Before starting the car 
however, all these devices had to be configured and tested. A standard feature 
was that the automobile would also check whether everybody was wearing safety 
belts, and whether there were elderly people or babies in the automobile. In 
case there were such passengers, they would receive special instructions. In 
case there were no elderly or babies in the car, this phase of checking took 
even more time: the automobile had to make <i>sure</i> that there were no 
elderly people or babies in the car. And if not, the babies could now be 
crossing the road in front of the automobile and all detectors had to be 
properly adjusted. All these procedures took time, and so after you would press 
the start button, another ten minutes would go by before you could actually 
drive your car. Very often, something went wrong. Then you had to stop the car 
and begin the starting procedure all over again.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;When you stepped <i>out</i> of your 
car, you also had to wait for a few minutes. This was because all devices that 
you were using during the ride, had to be switched off one-by-one, and the way 
you had adjusted their functioning had to be registered.&nbsp; Because of traffic 
lights, police control and other limiting factors, driving to your work would 
now take an average of 50 minutes.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;But that was not all. When you bought a
<i>new</i> automobile, all its devices were not yet properly installed.&nbsp; When, 
in your new automobile, you would try to open your window for the first time, a 
sign appeared, saying that you first had to go to the garage to have your 
window-opening device properly registered. You'd better not leave the garage 
before you also checked and registered the powered brakes, the steering wheel, 
the signal lights, the windshield wipers, the claxon, the safety belts, the baby detectors, and so on. 
Otherwise you would not be able to ride for more than a few inches. When you 
turned on the radio or TV for the first time, they both said that you first had 
to go to the electricity shop to obtain a registration number and a password for 
those. If you opened the hood to put luggage inside, you discovered that the 
hood also had to be registered first. The hood's lock had a password that you 
might have forgotten. You had to re-register the hood every six months.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;And then, you had the problem of 
gasoline poison. Some malafide gas stations purposefully put poison in the 
gasoline that you purchased, which would ruin your engine. This problem had to 
be addressed by buying antidotes for this poison at other, bonafide, gasoline stations. 
Since new brands of poison were being invented every month, automobile owners 
were forced to purchase new antidotes at gasoline stations routinely every month 
or so. All in all, it often took more than a week before the owner of a new 
automobile could drive his vehicle more or less comfortably. But, because of the 
frequent engine failures and broken cars on the highway, his journey from home 
to work would often last much longer than an hour. </span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">Only few people complained about this 
situation. After all, automobiles are complicated machines.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;By the way, the people in this 
civilization also had invented computers. When you bought one and switched it 
on, it would work instantly. </span> </span><span size="4">And they became better every year.</span></p>

        <p>Back with a post after 6 years of silence. If you had to parse a microsecond-resolution epoch timestamp as quickly as possible, how would you do it?  We’ll take a look at using compiler intrinsics to do it in log(n) time.</p>


        <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it’s json, maybe it’s a csv file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csv">timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// ???</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-native-solution">The native solution</h3>

<p>Let’s start with what’s available, and compare. We have
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/atoi"><code>std::atoll</code></a> , a function
inherited from C,
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_stringstream"><code>std::stringstream</code></a>
, the newer C++17
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/charconv"><code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code></a> header, and
by request
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi/reference/basics.html"><code>boost::spirit::qi</code></a>.
I’ll be using <a href="https://github.com/google/benchmark">Google Benchmark</a> to
measure the performance, and to have a baseline let’s compare against loading
the final result into a register - i.e. no actual parsing involved.</p>

<p>Let’s run the benchmarks! The code is not important here, it just shows what is being benchmarked.</p>

<p>Wow, <code>stringstream</code> is pretty bad. Not that it’s a fair comparison but parsing
a single integer using <code>stringstream</code> is 391 times slower than just loading our
integer into a register.  <code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code> and <code>boost::spirit</code> do a lot better by
comparison.</p>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we’re trying to parse, and we
don’t need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster?  Just how much time
is spent in validation?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-naive-solution">The naive solution</h3>

<p>Let’s write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>inline</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_naive</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>noexcept</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>digit</span> <span>:</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>digit</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure>
    <canvas id="benchmark-canvas-naive">

</figure>

<p>That’s actually not bad for a simple for loop. If such a simple solution is
able to beat a standard-library implementation, it means there’s quite a lot of
effort that goes into input validation. As a sidenote - if you know your input,
or can do simpler validation you can get some significant speedups.</p>

<p>For further solutions and benchmarks, let’s ignore the standard library
functions. We should be able to go much faster than this.</p>

<p>If we know it’s 16 bytes, why even have a forloop? Let’s unroll it!</p>

<p>Ok, that’s slightly better again, but we’re still processing a character at a time.</p>

<h3 id="the-byteswap-insight">The byteswap insight</h3>

<p>Let’s draw out the operations in the unrolled solution as a tree, on a
simplified example of parsing ‘1234’ into a 32-bit integer:</p>

<figcaption><p>Unrolled solution graph of operations for ‘1234’</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>We can see that the amount of multiplications and additions is linear with the
amount of characters. It’s hard to see how to improve this, because every
multiplication is by a different factor (so we can’t multiply “in one go”), and at
the end of the day we need to add up all the intermediate results.</p>

<p>However, it’s still very regular. For one thing, the first character in the
string is multiplied by the largest factor, because it is the most significant
digit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a little-endian machine (like x86), an integer’s first byte contains the
least significant digits, while the first byte in a string contains the most
significant digit.</p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption><p>Looking at the string as an integer we can get closer to
the final parsed state in fewer operations - see how the hex representation is
<strong>almost</strong> what we want</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Now to reinterpret the bytes of a string as an integer we have to use
<code>std::memcpy</code> (<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1307">to avoid strict-aliasing
violations</a>), and we have compiler
instrinsic <code>__builtin_bswap64</code> to swap the bytes in one instruction. The
<code>std::memcpy</code> will get optimized out, so this is a win so far.</p>

<p>But now that we have an integer that kind of, sort of looks like what we want,
how do we get it across the finish line without too much work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-divide-and-conquer-insight">The divide and conquer insight</h3>

<p>From the previous step, we end up with an integer whose bit representation 
has each digit placed in a separate byte. I.e. even though one byte can
represent up to 256 values, we have values 0-9 in each byte of the integer.
They are also in the right little endian order. Now we just need to “smash”
them together somehow.</p>

<p>We know that doing it linearly would be too slow, what’s the next possibility?
<strong>O(log(n))</strong>! We need to combine every adjacent digit into a pair in one step,
and then each pair of digits into a group of four, and so on, until we have the
entire integer.</p>

<p>After I posted the first version of this article, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gr18ig/faster_integer_parsing/frx9agb">Sopel97 on
reddit</a>
pointed out that the byteswap is not necessary. Combining adjacent digits works
either way - their order doesn’t matter.  I realized that it helped me with the
next insight, but could be omitted for the final code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key is working on adjacent digits simultaneously. This allows a tree of
operations, running in O(log(n)) time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This involves multiplying the even-index digits by a power of 10 and leaving the
odd-index digits alone. This can be done with bitmasks to selectively apply
operations</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-mask-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>By using bitmasking, we can apply operations to more than one digit at a time, to combine them into a larger group</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Let’s finish the <code>parse_8_chars</code> function we started earlier by employing this
masking trick. As a neat side-effect of the masking, we don’t need to subtract
<code>'0'</code>, since it will be masked away.</p>

<h3 id="the-trick">The trick</h3>

<p>Putting it all together, to parse our 16-digit integer, we break it up into two
chunks of 8 bytes, run <code>parse_8_chars</code> that we have just written, and benchmark it!</p>

<p>Not too shabby, we shaved almost 56% off of the unrolled loop benchmark! Still,
it feels like we are manually doing a bunch of masking and elementwise
operations. Maybe we can just let the CPU do all the hard work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-simd-trick">The SIMD trick</h3>

<p>We have the main insight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combine groups of digits simultaneously to achieve O(log(n)) time</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a 16-character, or 128-bit string to parse - can we use SIMD? Of
course we can! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple
Data</a>, and is exactly what we are looking
for. SSE and AVX instructions are supported on both Intel and AMD CPUs, and
 they typically work with wider registers.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Intrinsics
Guide</a> to find
the right compiler intrinsics for the right SIMD CPU instructions.</p>

<p>Let’s set up the digits in each of the 16 bytes first:</p>

   <!-- Title -->
   
   <p><img src="https://cheapskatesguide.org/pics/gopher-240.jpg" alt="Gopher">
      I first had access to the early Internet--what there was of 
      it--through the university I attended.  I remember how different 
      the Internet was back in the mid-to-late 1980's.  We had 
      electronic mail, but almost no one used it.  We logged onto 
      remote computers with telnet and transferred files with FTP.  
      All this was done at the command line.  If I remember correctly, 
      very few graphical user interfaces existed then.  Those that 
      did were composed of ASCII characters.  The first web browser was 
      not released until 1991.  Remembering causes me some sadness, 
      though in some ways the Internet is better now.  It certainly 
      has many more users, and that is a good thing.  I just wish it had 
      more Internet-savvy users.</p>

   <p>I remember that many of the early computer networks and websites on 
      the Internet were run by imaginative people with great senses of 
      humor.  For example, the computer network that I used at the second 
      engineering company for which I worked in the late 1980's had seven 
      sun workstations named after the seven dwarves.  As you may imagine, 
      that provided us with no end of entertainment.  "Dopey is down, 
      AGAIN!"  "Grumpy is acting up."  "Sneezy died yesterday.  When is 
      the funeral?"</p>

   <p>Back then, computers were something special.  They were wondrous.  
      Individuals who owned them were mavericks in a sense.  Buying a 
      personal computer then was the same as painting the word "nerd" in big 
      red letters across your forehead, and being known as a nerd back then was 
      not something you wanted.  One of my highschool friends built a 
      Heathkit computer.  The only display it had was in the form of 
      one-inch, red LED digits on the front.</p>

   <p>Now, that computers permeate our society, no one bothers giving them 
      interesting names.  They've nearly become fungible commodities that we 
      use up and then throw away when they have outlived their usefulness.  
      Nearly everyone uses the Internet at least occassionally.  And, 
      strangely enough, being called a nerd is seen as a good thing.</p>
   <h2>Gopherspace</h2>
   <p>The Gopher protocol was released by the University of Minnesota in 
      1991.  Gopher servers provided users with access to various types 
      of files, including text, binary, image, sound, and GIF.  But the 
      milieu of gopherspace was text.   Text was mostly what Gopher users 
      saw.  Users could also access FTP, telnet, and 
      Usenet servers.  Back in the 1990's, Veronica search engines
      tied together the network of Gopher servers in a similar way as 
      modern search engines do today with the webservers of the
      modern Internet.  In the 1990's, Jughead search engines were designed 
      to search individual Gopher servers.  And, Archie was an FTP search 
      engine.  Archie, Veronica, and Jughead search engines were named 
      after characters in the Archie comics that first appeared in print in
      1941.  Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, when people who loved 
      computers still ran much of the Internet, it reflected their 
      personalities.  Now, the Internet is more a beige and gray  
      reflection of the corporate world.</p> 
  
   <p>Today the Gopher protocol has been supplanted almost completely 
      by the HTTP protocol upon which the World Wide Web is based.
      Though the Internet has changed considerably, Gopher servers are 
      still around.  Text is still mostly what users see 
      in gopherspace, and it can still be navigated with 
      gopher-capable Internet browsers.  Sadly, only one Veronica search 
      engine appears to operate today.  Now, When a user navigates through
      gopherspace with the Veronica search engine, by following links, or
      by entering URL's into his browser, he has an experience in many 
      ways similar to surfing the modern Internet.</p>
   
   <p>Though about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)"> 
      two dozen Internet browsers</a> can still access gopherspace, either 
      natively or with plugins, I will only talk about one.  I'll focus on the 
      Lynx browser, because it is readily available, easy to use, and 
      powerful.  The Lynx browser also runs on all the major 
      operating systems.  I'll show readers how to use the Lynx browser 
      to get into gopherspace and have a look around.</p>
   <h2>Installing and Using the Lynx Browser</h2>
   <p>The Lynx browser is a text-only Internet browser that has native 
      support for gopherspace.  Lynx allows a user to seamlessly navigate 
      around the Internet and gopherspace using only the keys on his computer's 
      keyboard.  Lynx does not use a mouse or touchpad.  Windows computer 
      users can download the Lynx browser from the 
      <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx website</a>.</p>
 
   <div><p>Most Linux users can install Lynx simply by opening a Linux 
      terminal window and typing:
   </p></div><div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install lynx
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>

   Then, type "lynx" (without the quotes) at the command line to start 
   the Lynx browser.</p>

   <p>To go to a Gopher address using the Lynx browser, hit the "g" 
      key on your keyboard.  Near the bottom of the Lynx window, the 
      prompt "URL to open:" will appear.  Now, begin typing the Gopher 
      address.  Gopher URL's can also be copied and pasted from other 
      applications.  First, copy the URL from the other application, 
      then select the Lynx window, hit the right mouse button, and 
      select "paste".  Try going to this Gopher address for practice: 
      gopher://infinitelyremote.com/0/books/Internet_Gopher_Users_Guide.txt.  
      After you hit the "Enter" key, the text file entitled "Internet 
      Gopher Users Guide" should be visible in your Lynx window.</p>

   <p>Lynx has three user modes.  At this point, you are in the novice 
      user mode, so at the bottom of the page, the following instructions 
      should be visible: "-- press space for next page --  Arrow keys: 
      Up and Down to move.  Right to follow a link; Left to go back.  
      H)elp O)ptions P)rint G)o M)ain screen Q)uit /=search 
      [delete]=history list".</p>

   <p>At a basic level, Lynx is very easy to use, so a user does not 
      have to know much to navigate around gopherspace and read text 
      files.  I will go over the basic commands, and leave it to you 
      to learn more later.  To navigate around inside a text file that 
      contains no hyperlinks, press the space bar or the down arrow on 
      your keyboard to move down one page and the up arrow to move back 
      up one page.  The left arrow is like the back button in a modern 
      Internet browser; it takes you to the previous text file that you 
      visited.  In a text file with hyperlinks, pressing the up or down 
      arrow moves the cursor to the hyperlink above or below the 
      cursor's present position.  When the cursor is on a hyperlink, 
      pressing the "Enter" key or the right arrow takes you to the 
      document pointed to by the hyperlink.</p>

   <p>Some Gopher pages contain forms similar to HTML forms.  For 
      example, links to search engines may appear as a search line.  Use 
      the left or right arrow to move the cursor to the search line.  
      Then, type the key words you want to search for and hit the 
      "Enter" key.  This will take you to a search results page.</p>

   <p>To display the Gopher URL of the file you are currently reading, 
      hit the "=" key.  Then, hit the left arrow key to get back to the 
      file you were just reading.</p>

   <p>Exit from Lynx by hitting the "q" key.  By the way, most 
      command-line Linux programs that take control of a terminal 
      window can be exited by hitting either the "q" key or by typing 
      ":q".</p>

   <p>This is all the information you need to know to navigate around 
      in gopherspace (or on the rest of the Internet) using the Lynx 
      browser.  For additional instructions on the use of Lynx, bring 
      up Lynx and hit the "h" key.</p>
   <h2>Exploring Gopherspace</h2>
   <p>Now the fun begins.  Perhaps the best place to enter gopherspace 
      is gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/world.  There you will find 
      links to dozens of Gopher servers.  Floodgap claims that it 
      hosts the last Veronica search engine in existence.  So, from 
      Floodgap you can use the Veronica search engine to search 
      gopherspace by key words, or you can go to individual Gopher 
      user sites by following links to the Gopher servers that host them.</p>

   <p>One of the largest collections of Gopher user sites can be found 
      by following the Link on Floodgap labeled "'Greatest hits': most 
      recently verified Gopher servers".  From there, follow the link 
      labeled "sdf.org:70" to the Super-Dimensional Fortress (URL: 
      gopher://sdf.org/1).  There you will find many interesting phlogs 
      and files.  Gopher blogs are called phlogs.  One interesting 
      phlogger is Tomasino (gopher://sdf.org/1/users/tomasino/).  
      Another is solderpunk (gopher://sdf.org/1/users/solderpunk/).  
      There are also may others.  So, have fun and explore!</p>

With no need to remember a password or prove email ownership, <a href="https://medium.com/@kelvinvanamstel/should-we-embrace-magic-links-and-leave-passwords-alone-c73db7007fc4">many</a> <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/your-passwordless-future-make-it-sooner-rather-later">people</a> have hailed "Magic Link" as the perfect authentication solution.</p><p>How it works on SnapHabit? After a user enters their enter email address, we direct them to their inbox to tap a link to sign in. Before diving into what went wrong, here's a snapshot of our authentication funnel:</p><ul><li><strong>11% of users</strong> required at least 4 magic-link emails before completing signing up.</li><li><strong>18% of users never finished signup (clicked the magic link)</strong>. On average, these users attempted signup twice, with several users submitting &gt; 10 times.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="-why-would-you-use-magic-link-anyways">... why would you use magic link, anyways?</h2><p>Friends are core to SnapHabit, so the functionality to send a friend request is critical. Phone number or email felt like the cheapest way to support a unique identifier — as it could be used for both authentication and finding a friend.</p><p>Like most services, we first looked at using "Sign in with Google/Facebook". However, Apple recently adjusted App Store Guidelines... starting June 30, <strong>"apps that use a social login service ... must also offer Sign in with Apple"</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-3.47.00-PM-2.png"><figcaption>App Store Guidelines, June 17, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Apple Sign In supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">"Hide My Email"</a>, so many users who sign in with Apple would not have a meaningful email attached to their account. Asking for a user's email after they chose to "hide it" would be a poor user experience.</p><p>So in summary, we had 4 options for account creation:</p><ol><li><strong>Email + Password</strong> ... requires forgot password and users to prove email ownership</li><li><strong>Support all third-party (Apple, Google, Facebook)</strong> ... and add a new unique identifier to allow friends to find each other, given email will not be sufficient</li><li><strong>Phone number magic link</strong> ... we were relying on Expo (previously did not support phone-number auth), and we also felt emails would be a good/cheap tool for communication</li><li><strong>Email magic link</strong> </li></ol><p>Email magic link felt... perfect! &nbsp;We built the login flow, complete with a custom email, instructional webpage, and deep linking. <strong>Hurrah, we had cracked the authentication funnel!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QoS2-mIuOZw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="what-went-wrong-and-how-we-tried-to-solve">What went wrong and how we tried to solve</h2><p><em>If you're interested in the technical details of how we implemented some of these fixes, let me know and we'll consider publishing.</em></p><h3 id="1-users-clicking-the-link-on-another-device-">1. Users clicking the link on another device.</h3><p>Of 10 users we chatted with who had issues, 4 tried to click the link on another device. There are two routes to solving this:</p><ul><li>technical solution to support this behavior (clicking the link on desktop will authenticate the user on mobile)</li><li>better instructional text</li></ul><p><strong>The latter was simpler, so we started with that:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/firstattempt.png"></figure><p><strong>And again.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/email.png"></figure><p><strong>And more.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/landingpage.png"></figure><h3 id="2-user-confusion-about-clicking-a-link-to-login">2. User confusion about clicking a link to login</h3><p>At least 2 people mentioned they simply did not understand that they needed to authenticate with email. &nbsp;To solve this, we added</p><ul><li>call-to-action to open Apple Mail or Gmail</li><li>disabled the "resend" button for 10 seconds, to encourage users to tap the mail CTA before attempting login again</li></ul><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/buttons.png"></figure><h3 id="3-users-entering-the-wrong-email">3.

<p>You’ve probably seen the little surveys that pop up on this site from time to time. These are a way of discovering what visitors to the site care about, so I can write on topics that are directly helpful.</p>



<p>One of the biggest things that people want help with is “changing the wider organisation”. How might we approach this?</p>



<p>Our role might allow us to make sweeping changes, but it’s more likely that we have no control over the bigger picture. However, we can control what we say to our boss so they use their influence to make a difference.</p>



<p>The question then becomes: <em>“I want to change my boss’s mind – how do I do it?”</em></p>



<p>Conversations with our boss can be the hardest conversations of all. Let’s step through why it’s hard, and what we can do through a good conversation that can make a difference in our organisation.</p>



<h2>Step #0: If you have a nightmare boss, fire them if you can</h2>



<p>Firstly, let me lay it out straight for an unlucky few. There are some bosses who are narcissistic, self obsessed, and tend to claim credit for the hard work of others. They never listen, don’t acknowledge reality or others’ points of view, and treat everything as a power game. These bosses will eventually grind every employee they have into the ground.</p>



<p>If you’re in this position, you already know it. None of what I’m about to outline will work for you.</p>



<p>If you can, I suggest you fire your boss by changing your job as soon as possible. Reach out to me on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/chrismdp" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and I’ll share your resume for you.</p>



<p>If you’re not able to change your job that easily, then there are things you can do to manage difficult situations. I plan to write more about this in the future. In the meantime, here are <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up">some great articles</a> for dealing with difficult bosses. I’m lucky never to have had a boss like this, but I have come across them whilst consulting.</p>



<p>However, most bosses are not in this category. Nobody’s perfect, but your boss may well be trying to do the right thing, and shows some signs of listening to reason and humility. If that’s the case then you have enough to move on to the next step.</p>



<h2>Step #1: Confront your fear</h2>



<p>Even if we don’t have a nightmare boss, the fear factor is a powerful hidden problem for many of us. Plenty of people harbour irrational fears about their boss. This is sometimes because they don’t know them well, or they assume they’re going to be awful because of a bad previous experience. This fear saps our confidence, and makes it very difficult to get anything of consequence done at all.</p>



<p>It’s time to be honest with ourselves for a moment. Let’s confront any fear we have about being candid and building genuine relationship with our boss.</p>



<p>This is something I have had to come to terms with personally. I’ve struggled with placing too much value on people’s approval my entire life. Because of this, I have a tendency to change my behaviour to match what I think are others’ expectations or desires of me. I have to be careful not to sugar-coat difficult topics. I have to push into taking the right decision even if it means people aren’t going to be happy. </p>



<p>If this is an area of struggle for us, we are only going to have good conversations with our boss with a similar amount of self-reflection. I’d <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverydoubled.com/agile-conversations-why-this-is-a-must-read-for-agile-leaders/" target="_blank">recommend you start with the Agile Conversations book</a> to help unpick your own communication triggers and patterns.</p>



<p>As an aside: if you’re managing people, you need to spend time intentionally dispelling a fear culture. I spent a <em>lot</em> of my time carefully crafting intentional messages to my team to get their honest feedback, so that I’m not that boss that allows fear to propagate in their team. Make sure you explicitly ask for feedback from people about how things can be better, and explicitly invite disagreement. If you don’t, you won’t get it.</p>



<h2>Step #2: Start to talk</h2>



<p>Now you’ve dealt with the fear, it’s time to talk. If you’re not having <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverydoubled.com/how-to-use-one-to-ones-to-level-up-your-agile-team-communication/" target="_blank">regular one-to-ones</a> with your boss, then ask for them. It’s important to spend at least some time with your boss at least once a week.</p>



<p>By regularly catching up with your boss, you can slowly build relationship and goodwill with them. That way, when a tricky conversation comes around, or you need something to happen in the wider organisation, you’ll have the ability to push back. You may even be able to reserve a bad decision if you need to.</p>



<p>Try and understand their motivations. Don’t complain. Empathise with their position if you can, and restate their arguments to check your understanding.</p>



<p>For more help in checking you understand their train of thought, I’d recommend Douglas Squirrel’s “TDD for people” technique. It’s detailed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/o2im0xkvfwu3/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5LmFjYXN0LmNvbS9zL3Ryb3VibGVzaG9vdGluZy1hZ2lsZS90ZXN0LWRyaXZlbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1mb3ItcGVvcGxl" target="_blank">in this podcast</a>.</p>



<h2>Step #3: Ask for feedback</h2>



<p>Perhaps you have a boss who is always offering constructive feedback. However, if you have a boss who is more laissez-faire in their approach to you, it’s important to ask for feedback on your performance. Ask them to be honest with you. Let them know you’re happy to receive any kind of constructive comments on how to improve.</p>



<p>I’m always pleased when a team member asks me for feedback, as it shows that they respect my opinion, and it gives me an opportunity to help them. Your boss will likely feel the same.</p>



<h2>Step #4: See their side</h2>



<p>When talking to your boss, ask searching questions to help you to understand your boss’s point of view. Ask what your boss wants to see happen. If it’s it’s all surface level changes they’d like to see, make sure you take the time to understand <em>why</em> they want those changes.</p>



<p>Mary Abbajay, in her book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2YO06PS" target="_blank">Managing Up</a>, talks about how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2018/05/26/why-managing-up-is-a-skillset-you-need/#7548a65937fd" target="_blank">people will often resist the idea</a> of managing up (taking charge of one’s workplace experience) through their own ego – our own need to be right. We become obsessed with “my boss should” or “my boss needs to” without considering their needs or perspective. We get trapped in our own views, needs and wants.</p>



<p>Ideally you want their honest answers to questions like these:</p>



<ul><li>Is there anything you would like me (or my team) to be doing more of?</li><li>What makes you stressed?</li><li>How much freedom do I have to change our processes or practices?</li><li>What needs to stay the same? Why?</li></ul>



<p>Listen carefully to how they see things, and strive to understand their context and their point of view. Use all the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverydoubled.com/how-to-use-one-to-ones-to-level-up-your-agile-team-communication/" target="_blank">one-to-one listening techniques on this post</a>.</p>



<h2>Step #5: Be patient</h2>



<p>As Abbajay points out, your boss might change their mind, but your boss won’t fundamentally change who they are. You can only manage your reaction and interaction.</p>



<p>The only way that you’ll be able to change your boss’s mind when it matters is through good prep work. This takes time. Don’t rush it. When the moment comes where you need to change your boss’s mind, if you don’t have that relationship, you might as well not bother trying.</p>



<p>Even then, you may not succeed. They’re an individual with their own concerns, and may have context you don’t know anything about. However, by doing the prep work you’ve given yourself the best chance of having influence and a chance to spend that influence when it matters.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you want to change your boss’s mind, don’t try and do it without building relationship first. That can have the opposite effect to what you intend. Take time now to earn goodwill, so that you can use it when you need to. Then you’ll be able to change your boss’s mind when it matters, unblock your organisation’s delivery bottlenecks and allow your team to flourish.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In a rush?</strong> You <em>could</em> jump to <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a>, but I highly recommend reading the introductory sections first. <strong>Foam</strong> isn’t obvious.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/vercel">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage">
        <div><p><img src="https://dev.p.ota.to/images/5670392840585216/" alt="Image"></p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Two of my favourites things are React and dinosaurs.
In this article I will show how I’ve put them together to develop a server side rendering <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application with <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a>.</p>
<h2>Project Setup</h2>
<p>I will assume that we are all familiar with React and Deno. Knowing that Deno is pretty new, if you don’t know how to install it and how it works, I would highly suggest you to have a read at this great <a href="https://dev.p.ota.to/post/an-introduction-to-deno-4u3suut77w6/">introduction</a> before diving into this article.</p>
<p>Now let’s start creating the project structure and the files needed for this tutorial, I’m using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> but any editor will do.
Open your terminal and type:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir deno-react-ssr &amp;&amp; cd $_
code .
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new folder called <code>deno-react-ssr</code> and will open it with vscode.
In this folder we will need to create three files, <code>app.tsx</code> that will contain the code of the React component, <code>server.tsx</code> for the server code and <code>deps.ts</code> will contain all our dependencies. Think of it as our version of a <code>package.json</code>.
You will end up with a structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── app.tsx
├── deps.ts
└── server.tsx
</code></pre>
<h2>Setting up the dependencies</h2>
<p>In <code>deps.ts</code> we will have to export all the dependencies needed for this application to run.
Copy the following code and add it to your file.</p>
<pre><code>// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react/v16.13.1/react.d.ts"
import React from 'https://jspm.dev/react@16.13.1';
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react-dom/v16.13.1/server.d.ts"
import ReactDOMServer from 'https://jspm.dev/react-dom@16.13.1/server';
export { React, ReactDOMServer }
export { Application, Context, Router } from 'https://deno.land/x/oak@v4.0.0/mod.ts';
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in Deno you import the modules directly from a url. 
I’ve decided to import React and ReactDOMServer from <a href="https://jspm.org/">jspm</a> as suggested in the <a href="https://deno.land/#third-party-modules">documentation for third party modules</a> but you can use any other CDN that provides the same modules.</p>
<p>One unusual thing that may stand out to you could be this:<br>
<code>// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react/v16.13.1/react.d.ts"</code><br>
Since we are using typescript, this line of code will inform Deno of the location of the types it needs to import and will affect the <code>import</code> statement that follows. A more exhaustive explanation can be found in the <a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/typescript#compiler-hint">Deno Type Hint</a> manual.</p>
<p>I’ve also decided to use <a href="https://github.com/oakserver/oak">Oak</a>, a middleware framework for <a href="https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/http/mod.ts">Deno's http server</a> that also provides a router, so I’m importing all the modules we will use in the server in addition to the <code>Context</code> type that typescript requires.</p>
<h2>Create your React component</h2>
<p>This is how our <code>app.tsx</code> component will look:</p>
<pre><code>import { React } from "./deps.ts";

const App = () =&gt; {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const garden = {
    backgroundColor: 'green',
    height: 'auto',
    fontSize: '30px',
    maxWidth: '400px',
    padding: '20px 5px',
    width: '100%'
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="pure-g pure-u"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;My DenoReact App&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;button className="pure-button" onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Add a 🦕 in your garden!&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;p style={garden}&gt;
      { Array(count).fill(&lt;span&gt;🦕&lt;/span&gt;) }
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>As with any standard React component, we start by importing React from our <code>deps.ts</code> file.</p>
<p>Then we are going to declare our App component that uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a> to implement a simple button counter that allows you to add as many dinosaurs as you want in your personal garden!</p>
<h2>Setting up the Server</h2>
<p>For the server I’m using <a href="https://github.com/oakserver/oak">Oak</a> and the code in <code>server.tsx</code> will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import {
  Application,
  Context,
  React,
  ReactDOMServer,
  Router,
} from './deps.ts';

import App from "./app.tsx";

const PORT = 8008;

const app = new Application();
const jsBundle = "/main.js";

const js =
`import React from "https://jspm.dev/react@16.13.1";
 import ReactDOM from "https://jspm.dev/react-dom@16.13.1";
 const App = ${App};
 ReactDOM.hydrate(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('app'));`;  


const html =
  `&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css"&gt;
      &lt;script type="module" src="${jsBundle}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;main id="app"&gt;${ReactDOMServer.renderToString(&lt;App /&gt;)}&lt;/main&gt;  
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;`;

const router = new Router();
router
  .get('/', (context: Context) =&gt; {
    context.response.type = 'text/html';
    context.response.body = html;
  })
  .get(jsBundle, (context: Context) =&gt; {
    context.response.type = 'application/javascript';
    context.response.body = js;
  });

app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());

console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}...`);

await app.listen({ port: PORT });
</code></pre>
<p>As always we need to import all the dependencies we will use in our server. 
We will also import our App we created earlier, as you can see the extension <code>.tsx</code> is required in Deno so don’t forget it!<br>
Next step is to create our Oak server application and we’ll also need to define some routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'/'</code> will serve our HTML page that contains the rendered app.  </li>
<li><code>'/main.js'</code>  will serve our application code that is needed to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydrate</a> the client side React application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally we tell our application to use the route we just created and start listening on port <code>8008</code>. You can notice I’m also using <code>router.allowedMethods()</code>, it’s a middleware that lets the client know when a route is not allowed.</p>
<h2>Run the application</h2>
<p>Running the SSR React application we just created is extremely simple, you just need to use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>deno run --allow-net ./server.tsx
</code></pre>
<p>Deno is built secure by default, that means that a Deno application will not be able to access your network, to overcome this we'll just need to use Deno's <code>--allow-net</code> flag.<br>
Now the only thing missing is to open <code>http://localhost:8008/</code> and enjoy your new App!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the brief tutorial illustrated in this article and I’m looking forward to seeing what will happen next and how more complex applications can be built with this stack.</p>

</p>

<p>Below, we use the <a href="https://github.com/adalca/tipiX">tipiX</a> interactive visualization tool for some time lapses. The first row shows real time lapses created by artists, the second row shows videos synthesized by the <i>visual deprojection</i> baseline, and the third row shows videos synthesized by our method. To use the tipiX tool, click on the image to pause/start the autoplay feature, and move your mouse from left to right to move through each time lapse.</p>

	<section>
		<p>A LOT has been said (written) about how COVID-19 has enforced "remote revolution" in software development companies (&amp; not only). About the benefits, challenges and risks. Tools, techniques &amp; processes. Almost everything remote-related one could think about.</p><p>Except for leadership. <strong>Remote leadership.</strong></p><hr><p><em>Disclaimer #1: pretty please - do NOT confuse 'leadership' with 'management' - these are two completely different topics. </em><em>I intend to focus on 'leadership' only.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer #2: this is not a blog post about the top 5% of the market - companies that excel in a distributed model, have practiced it for years, etc. It's a consideration about everyone else - companies where unicorns do not poop rainbows.</em> </p><hr><p>On one hand: the true leader is always a leader, regardless of circumstances. Remote-first (hub-less) distributed teams are (by definition) fully symmetrical: everyone shares the same constraints - a candidate for a genuine leader suffers the same difficulties her/his associates do.</p><p>But on the other hand, let's consider the nature of leadership. No, I'm not going to (re-)define what leadership is (again) - I assume you do know it at this point. Instead, let's focus on "the medium" of leadership.</p><p>What's "the protocol" that true leaders do influence (positively) others through? How do "the leadership particles transmit"? Do you need continuous physical proximity and maybe it's OK to have a video call once a week?</p><p>Apart from purely individual traits (like charisma, professional credibility, authority, having an inspiring vision, being able to communicate it, etc.), there's a need for <strong>CONNECTION</strong> (between a leader and her/his followers).</p><p>I'd define <strong>CONNECTION</strong> as a function of <strong>PRESENCE</strong>, <strong>BANDWIDTH</strong> &amp; established, mutual <strong>TRUST</strong>.</p><ol><li>What's the <strong>PRESENCE</strong>? It's being around. Making an example (impersonating some principle). Exchanging a glance and nodding respectfully. It's comforting for your team-mates to know that you're always close and with every small interaction you express that you (personally) care. It's also inspiring for them to see you in action, personally involved, when they notice details of your behavior (derivatives of your experience) you find absolutely mundane.</li><li>While the presence is one thing, the <strong>BANDWIDTH</strong> (of communication) is the other one. To make an impact, one has to have clarity, which comes out of awareness and indirectly: data (information). It's not just the range of information, but also its accuracy and timeliness. It's thanks to sufficient bandwidth that you're capable of properly assessing the situation (e.g., commitment, burden, stress &amp; risk level) - which is crucial to make decisions about where to aim for leverage.</li><li>What about <strong>TRUST</strong>? The trust is very interesting, because a leader's efforts to increase presence and bandwidth may imply the actual luck of trust (a team is afraid that leader doesn't trust the team, so (s)he tightens the apparatus of control). In distributed scenarios, such efforts are, by default, much more obtrusive.</li></ol><p>What's my point?</p><p>Team distribution works like a charm in mature, mesh-like org structures. With very small, autonomous, highly engaged and truly entrepreneurial teams. Where people do understand the meaning of all three pillars of agility: autonomy, transparency &amp; discipline. Those teams will perform superbly regardless of the scenario. In such organizations, everyone is (some sort of) a leader.</p><p><strong>But scaling such teams is very difficult.</strong> And it requires top-notch, carefully selected people on board. Even the positive effects are frequently highly unstable (depend on a particular composition which will not last forever, then they lose their <em>"magick"</em>).</p><p>In the majority of scenarios I've ever encountered, the org structure doesn't really resemble an autonomous, self-catalyzing mesh:</p><ul><li>there's an "old guard" and the "new guard"</li><li>there are people who are very engaged and ones who ... care less</li><li>some have company-aligned priorities, while many do not</li><li>while some feel accountable for the outcomes of their work, many others just follow the instructions (do what they are told to)</li><li>knowledge silos are solidified by the never-ending urge to go fast, which causes various asymmetries within teams</li></ul><p>I'm not implying anyone's bad will. Not at all - it's just the reality. And still - all those "non-exceptional", unbalanced, flawed teams can also do decently (at least). But they need dedicated, strong <strong>LEADERS</strong> to set (&amp; keep) the direction, be the catalysts and simple drive things. And the ability of those (especially new) leaders to develop and maintain a strong <strong>CONNECTION</strong> will be from now on significantly more challenged. I'm not saying it's not possible to make a decent impact as a leader remotely, but I believe that it will nearly always take more time &amp; effort (with a bigger part of energy consumed by "friction" and inertia).</p><hr><p>My thesis is that many of hitherto leaders are not prepared for the pivot (of everyone around going remote). Most of them are currently <em>"traveling with momentum"</em> (based on what was developed in the days before the pandemic). But they are from now on playing a completely different kind of sport - and the difficulty bar has been significantly raised.</p><p>I can't help being curious about what kind of long-term effects (of the situation described above) we'll observe in the next year or two. At this point it's nothing but a wild guess:</p><ul><li>a new generation of "distributed era leaders" will arise, with skill-sets more suited to how the situation has evolved?</li><li>fragmentation will increase - companies, services and products will gravitate towards smaller, more independent teams &amp; offerings?</li><li>getting a taste of the remote model will prove to be a temporary fashion - a new wave of highly efficient co-located challengers will out-compete their rivals struggling with effective distribution?</li><li>we'll all just get used to lower efficiency and higher inertia, because the benefits of distributed work models are still a fair compensation for the price?</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<p>One of my favorite games of all time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption" target="_blank">Red Dead Redemption</a>
returned with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2" target="_blank">prequel</a> for consoles in 2018. Then it came for PCs in 2019.
I finally managed to play the game and amazed by its graphics immediately.
But I got upset because I can barely play the game on medium settings at 25 FPS with a 1050Ti laptop GPU.
I know that I don't have a good rig but 25 FPS on medium settings?</p>

<p>Today, we are going to look at some frame captures from the game and try to analyze graphics techniques used in the game.</p>

<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>This isn't an official breakdown of the game. It just me analyzing <a href="https://renderdoc.org/" target="_blank">RenderDoc</a> frame captures.
If you want to learn from the actual developers,
you can check the slides from a SIGGRAPH talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/globbbe" target="_blank">Fabian Bauer</a>.
<a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2019/index.htm" target="_blank">Slides</a> (At the bottom of the page), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3305366.3335036" target="_blank">Video</a> (starts at 1:58:00)</p>

<p>You can also read a graphics analysis of GTA5 by Adrian Courrèges <a href="https://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/" target="_blank">here</a>.
Since both RDR2 and GTA5 are from the same company and uses the same engine, some of the techniques from GTA5 present here as well.</p>

<p>Another important thing is that, I am not a senior graphics programmer or anything like that.
I am still a junior in this field.
So, there will be plenty of things that I don't understand. If you find any mistakes or things that can be improved, please reach out to me. Here we go!</p>

<h2 id="dissecting-a-frame">Dissecting a frame</h2>

<p>Here is the main frame for dissecting:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/mainframe.jpg" alt="MainFrame">
<em>Captured on PC, medium settings.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to a game like RDR2, it's almost impossible to see all the techniques in one frame.
It amortizes its work across multiple frames.
Because of that, I captured more than a single frame but this is the main one we are going to be focusing on.
It contains a lot of properties like; spot and point lights, directional light (it's very subtle but it's there), buildings, NPCs, a horse, trees, vegetation, clouds, etc. It should demonstrate most of the rendering techniques used in the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RDR2 is an open-world game that streams data constantly. Because of that, the frame starts with a bunch of tasks like creating and deleting textures, shader resource views, unordered access views, updating descriptors, buffers, etc.</p>

<h3 id="mud-map">Mud map</h3>

<p>Mud plays a big role in the game. Beside being a game mechanic, it makes envrionments more realistic. The game renders footprint textures of humans and horses into a displacement map along with trail textures of horse wagon wheels. This accumulated texture is used for <a href="https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/Tatarchuk-POM.pdf" target="_blank">Parallax Occlusion Mapping</a> when rendering terrain.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/mudmap.png" alt="MudMap">
<em>Mud map: 2048x2048 <code>R16_UNORM</code></em></p>

<h3 id="sky-and-clouds">Sky and clouds</h3>

<p>After the mud pass, the game does a lot of work on GPU compute. Most of them related to sky and clouds.
Clouds, fog, and volumetrics are RDR2's prominent effects.
You can find more information about this stage on Fabian's slides. He explains in far more detail than I could ever explain.</p>

<h3 id="environment-map">Environment map</h3>

<p>Environment maps are the main source of reflections in RDR2 as well as GTA5.
<a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#environment-cubemap" target="_blank">Like the GTA5</a>, RDR2 generates an environment cubemap from the camera position.
It generates a thin GBuffer for the envrionment map, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD6KcxcCl_8" target="_blank">Far Cry 4</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envalbedo.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapAlbedo">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Albedo): <code>RGBA8_SRGB</code></em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envnormal.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapNormal">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Normal): <code>RGBA8_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envdepth.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapDepth">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Depth): <code>D32S8</code></em></p>

<p>Environment cubemap generation in every frame can be a heavy task. RDR2 does some optimizations to reduce the cost.
For example, the game only draws static and opaque objects, does <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/frustum-culling-r4613/" target="_blank">frustum culling</a> before rendering each face, and draws lower LOD versions of models.
Although, I've found that poly count of the terrain is still very high for environment maps.</p>

<p>After the G-Buffer pass, a sky environment cubemap is generated using a sky paraboloid map and cloud-related textures.
The next step is convolution. RDR2 uses <a href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf" target="_blank">split sum approximation</a> for Image Based Lighting.
That method uses a pre-filtered environment cubemap along with an environment BRDF LUT.
For filtering, the game convolutes an environment cubemap and stores convoluted versions in the cubemap's mipmap levels.</p>

<p>Before executing a lighting pass for the environment cubemap, RDR2 renders baked large-scale ambient occlusion into another cubemap texture.
The game uses screen space ambient occlusion but SSAO can help you on a small scale.
Baked ambient occlusion helps to darken on a large scale such as darkening in patios and interiors.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envao.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapBakedAO">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Baked AO): <code>R8_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p>The game uses <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023510/Advanced-Graphics-Techniques-Tutorial-Day" target="_blank">tile-based deferred rendering</a> path for calculating the lighting of environment maps.
The light culling and the lighting are calculated together in one compute pass for each environment map face. (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/benoitvimont" target="_blank">@benoitvimont</a> for pointing that out)
The game also uses the "top-down world lightmap" technique, <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017710/Rendering-Assassin-s-Creed" target="_blank">similar to Assassin's Creed III</a>, for baked lighting.</p>

<p>For each cubemap face, RDR2 renders the final color on top of the sky environment texture.
Then it filters the environment cubemap same as the sky environment cubemap.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envfinal.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapFinal">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Final): <code>R11G11B10_FLOAT</code></em></p>

<p>RDR2 also loads envrionment maps that located in building interiors when the player is near a building.
These are also cubemap G-Buffers streamed from the disk.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvalbedo.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapAlbedo">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Albedo): <code>BC3_SRGB</code> (Baked AO stored in alpha channel)</em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvnormal.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapNormal">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Normal): <code>BC3_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvdepth.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapDepth">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Depth): <code>R16_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p>The game calculates the lighting of these maps and filters them like the previous ones.
It only calculates one baked environment map at a time and only recalculates them when the time of day changes.
All of the environment maps are stored in a texture cubemap array. There isn't any <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#cubemap-to-dual-paraboloid-map" target="_blank">cubemap to dual-paraboloid map conversion</a>.</p>

<h3 id="g-buffer-pass">G-Buffer Pass</h3>

<p>This stage starts with terrain depth prepass and then the game renders scene into G-Buffers.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>D32S8</code>: Like the GTA5, RDR2 is also using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/content/depth-precision-visualized" target="_blank">reversed-z</a> for depth and using the stencil buffer to assign certain values to certain group of meshes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is another target is generated from baked data:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This buffer contains baked ambient occlusion in the red channel, the same as in the environment map stage.
But there are other channels in this texture. The green channel contains some data that looks like the data in GBuffer 3's blue channel.
Again, I don't know what is this data used for. And I can't find any data in blue and alpha channels on my captures. I will investigate this further.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-map-generation">Shadow Map Generation</h3>

<p>After the G-Buffer stage, the game starts to render shadow maps.
It uses 2D texture arrays for point light shadow maps and texture cube arrays for point light shadow maps.</p>

<p>Some games use big shadow atlas texture for shadow maps (<a href="http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2016/Siggraph2016_idTech6.pdf" target="_blank">e.g DOOM</a>).
One of the advantages of that method is shadow map size can vary based on distance.
When you use texture arrays, you lose that flexibility because all of the textures in texture arrays must be the same size.
RDR2 has 3 different texture arrays for different quality.
For example, spotlights have:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>512x768 D16</strong> for distant lights</li>
<li><strong>1024x1536 D16</strong> for medium distance(and closer distance on medium setting) lights</li>
<li><strong>2048x3072 D16</strong> for closer lights (on high/ultra settings)</li>
</ul>

<p>Point lights cast shadows in all directions. To deal with that problem, games use a technique called <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Point-Shadows" target="_blank">Omnidirectional Shadow Mapping</a>
where you render the scene into a depth cubemap from the camera position. Campfire shadows and shadows from Arthur's lantern are rendered using this technique.
Point light shadows have 3 different arrays for different quality settings same as spotlights.</p>

<p>Most of the static point lights in the game have baked shadow cubemaps.
So, the game uses baked shadows whenever it can and only generates shadow maps when the player is near a light-volume.
But things get more interesting than that.</p>

<p>Most of the lights on walls are spotlights but the game doesn't generate an omnidirectional shadow map for them.
Instead, it generates a spotlight shadow map and copies that shadow map's memory into pointlight shadow map cube array.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img width="512" height="768" src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/spotshadow.jpg"></td>
<td><img width="128" height="768" src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/pointshadow.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Left image is a 1024x1536 spotlight shadow map, right image is the same image data in 512x512 texture cube format</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that local light shadow maps stores linear z.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That explains why they are not using a square sized shadow map for spotlights.
Pixel count for spotlight shadow and point light texture cubemap should be the same.
I am sure you noticed some slice pattern in the right image.
That happens because the width of spot and point light shadow map is different.</p>

<p>Also note that this texture doesn't cover 360 degrees.
But luckily, lights on buildings generally have a wall on their backside and baked shadow maps cover it.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that this process is vice-versa.
For example, in Saint Denis -one of the biggest cities in the game- the game generates omnidirectional shadow maps for spotlights
and copies that data into spotlight shadow map array.
I don't know why RDR2 doing shadow mapping like this. I couldn't find any similar technique on the internet.</p>

<p>Directional light shadow mapping in RDR2 is pretty much the <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#shadows" target="_blank">same as in GTA5</a>. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/cascaded-shadow-maps" target="_blank">Cascaded Shadow Mapping</a> with 4 cascades.

In honour of my past self and to help all fellow startup founders! </p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>Here are a few basic tips you should get started with. They will pay off in the coming months. </p>
<h3 id="start-with-seo">Start with SEO</h3>
<p>SEO will not get you users overnight, but it's an amazing long term investment. Do it. 
Obviously, don't try to rank for super general keywords, instead, focus on niche keywords your audience is interested in. Here are a few examples from our own startup: </p>

<h3 id="quora-twitter-answer-to-questions">Quora &amp; Twitter: Answer to questions</h3>
<p>Create a company account and start replying to questions related to what you're doing. Twitter has a really good advanced search feature and Quora will suggest you more than enough questions you can reply to.

<p>That's where stuff gets exciting. Use these growth hacks with moderation, there is a fine line between marketing and spamming. </p>
<h3 id="product-hunt-phantombuster-twitter">Product Hunt + PhantomBuster + Twitter</h3>
<p>If there are already a few apps on ProductHunt that are similar to what you're building, consider using  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-growth-hacked-my-way-to-500-waiting-list-subscribers-9612933fd3">this growth hack</a>. I've used it extensively myself. </p>
<h3 id="buy-targeted-email-lists">Buy targeted email lists</h3>
<p>I've built a tool myself that lets me scrape email addresses from founders on Indie Hacker. What's powerful is that you can filter by every filter available on Indie Hacker (revenue, location, business model, ...). You can use it to buy an email list here and use a tool like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gmass.com/">Gmass</a> or Streak to reach out.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scrapeindiehacker.app/">Buy a list here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't recommend just sending the same email to everyone as this will impact your reputation. Instead, send personalized mass emails. It does take a bit longer, but it's worth every second considering the impact it will have on response rate and trust.</p>

<p>There are many chrome extensions out there that have tons of users but that are not maintained anymore. You can buy one for very cheap that is related to what you do and advertise your business on there. I bought  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-contacts-opener/pjpambjkhcilibnmeihhfgdkhfelbdkj">Google Contacts Opener</a>  and it's been generating significant traffic to our website ever since. </p>

<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>It will cost you too much. Just don't think about it. In the early days, ads are not the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="launch-on-product-hunt">Launch on Product Hunt</h3>
<p>You've got only one shot at this, it better be big. You don't want to launch on Product Hunt before having built a mature product. Product Hunt is not for the launching phase, it's for the growth phase.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a> is a better place to start.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ew PHP, right? High-fives all around. Except that for my generation, the first cool web app you’d create would be written in PHP, often coupled with MySQL. Not only it is a language you can use object-oriented principles if used well but also it is free to use. There is a reason that massive platforms such as Shopify, Facebook or even WordPress still use PHP to this day. Today,  I will show you how to set up your WordPress development environment in about 10 minutes with the power of Docker.</p><h2>Before we start you will need</h2><ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Desktop</a>, available on Windows 10 (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.codingnagger.com/2020/06/20/install-docker-desktop-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even Home</a>), OS X. Not sure about the option for Linux but you can definitely set up docker and docker-compose. It will come with the tools we will use here:<ul><li>Docker, because we will be using containers</li><li>Docker-compose will make it easier to orchestrate our WordPress and DB container without too much overhead.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I am using VSCode but feel free to use any IDE or text editor you feel comfortable with.</p><h2>Create your root development folder</h2><p>In my case, I created a wordpress-dev folder which is will be my workspace where all the plugins and themes will go. Assume that from now on, I will refer to files and actions to execute will be relative to the wordpress-dev path.</p><p>The first file we will create is a docker-compose file. This file will contain the base information to spin up our docker and MySQL containers for use. I copied it from the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress">WordPress docker page</a> and made a minor change for now. I fixed the WordPress version to make sure that this tutorial will still work regardless of when you go through it.</p>  <p>Save the file as<strong> <em>docker-compose.yml</em></strong> and execute the following command:</p><pre>docker-compose up</pre><p>After a few seconds, maybe minutes depending on your setup, you should see this:</p><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="210" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?w=1383&amp;ssl=1 1383w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-old-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?w=1383&amp;ssl=1 1383w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><h2>Checking your default setup is good</h2><p>Your WordPress instance would be working and accessible at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8080</a>.

Personally, I store the dev credentials in a text file in the folder so I don’t need to ever bother about these. Plus if someone actually gets hold of my machine all they have is a local setup password unused anywhere else. After filling the fields and pressing “Install WordPress” you land on the installation confirmation page.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?w=844&amp;ssl=1 844w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?w=844&amp;ssl=1 844w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><h2>Completing your WordPress development workspace</h2><p>Now you’re all set with a local installation of WordPress that is ripe for local experimentation, you need an easy way to plug the useful stuff. You know, the plugin and themes folders you’re here for.</p><p>First, go to your workspace folder and create the <em><strong>themes </strong></em>and <em><strong>plugins </strong></em>sub-folders. Now we will add volumes for the WordPress container to map the workspace plugins and themes to the WordPress installation. This is how the <em><strong>docker-compose</strong></em> file will look like:</p>  <p>Once you updated the docker-compose file, use the kill shortcut, Ctrl-C or Cmd-C depending on your platform.</p><p>Now there is a gotcha. Since your theme folder is empty, if you try to bring the containers back up you will have an error message about the <strong><em>twentytwenty </em></strong>folder gone missing. In order to avoid that, you will need to install the TwentTwenty theme manually. To do so, download it here and extract it. You should have a twentytwenty folder with the theme files inside. Copy that folder to your workspace themes folder.</p><p>Finally, bring back up your containers with the compose up command.</p><pre>docker-compose up</pre><p>Now if you go back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8080</a> you should see your install is still there.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?w=1752&amp;ssl=1 1752w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1536%2C848&amp;ssl=1 1536w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-old-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?w=1752&amp;ssl=1 1752w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1536%2C848&amp;ssl=1 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><h2>Validating your WordPress development setup with a dummy plugin</h2><p>Now that environment is set, time to create a plugin through it.

You now have a working development setup to create and contribute to open-source WordPress plugins. For the open-source plugins, you may clone them directly in your workspace plugin repository as long as the root folder matches the released plugin in shape. As you can see on the screenshot above, the Podlove plugin I cloned in my workspace plugins folder is there too. One thing to be careful about though, if you delete the plugin in WordPress, it will delete the folder so make sure it is actually what you want.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed that tutorial, and feel free to share it with your friends, colleagues, family and pets.

  <h2>My Personal Digital transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/7756/9635/files/Smartphone_addiction_Burnout_Balance_relationship_1024x1024.png?v=1591043209" alt="Smartphone Addiction, Burnout and Balance Relationship Technology dependency"></p>
<p><strong>When do we start focusing on the digital transformation that is going on in the lives of each of us, individually? When did any of us make a conscious choice about how we want digital tech to add to our lives? A story about&nbsp;<a href="https://lifebeyond.one/?ref=hackernoon.com">smartphone addiction</a>, maximizing human potential and releasing a new book from a state of near-burnout.</strong></p>
<div><p>My name is Erwin, and I am addicted to my smartphone.</p></div>

<div><p>And I’m climbing out of a state of near-burnout. Let’s figure out what the two have to do with each other exactly, and what that could mean for you. If you're someone who is active in the world of tech, this will be of special relevance to you. At least I think it will.</p></div>


<p>I have been going through a very personal digital transformation. And I think in a sense we all are. Meanwhile the world is talking about “digital transformation” as something that happens<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>us, that is driven by tech companies and IT departments.</p>





<div><p>But what about the digital transformation that is going on in the life of every individual human on the planet right now?</p></div>

<h2>Has Tech Been Creeping Up On&nbsp;Us?</h2>
<p>Tech seeped into our lives almost like a silent virus over the course of the last four or five decades. And it is changing us. For better or for worse.</p>
<p>I feel as though tech is something that dripped into our lives little by little, as human beings born before around 1990.</p>





<p>The tech companies created these awesome functionalities. The nerds, the cool kids, the smart business men — they started using them. Our friends started using them. So we decided we’d give them a try as well.</p>





<p>For those of us born after 1990, using digital tech was the norm pretty much since the day they arrived on the planet. The process of cool kids and nerds using new stuff first is still a thing, mind you. Can you say TikTok?</p>





<p>Governments and major companies started expecting us to be digital. We started to expect each other to be digital.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/life-beyond/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-a715b119b8db?ref=hackernoon.com">It became the social norm to be online and connected at all times</a>. It became the social norm to check work email at all times and to share whatever you’re doing or thinking on social networks.</p>




<p>It even became a social norm to be almost compulsively catching up with people digitally, ignoring the people you were present with.</p>




<p>But when did any of us make a conscious choice?</p>





<h2>A Conscious Choice for Our Use of Our Digital Technology</h2>
<p>When did any of us say: “Wow, these new tools and capabilities are really cool. I’m going to try my utmost to use these tools in such a way that I can…”?</p>
<p>I feel very strongly that we never did. I feel that we subconsciously chose to start using email, Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify, SnapChat, AirBnB, Booking, Uber, Netflix etc. etc. until it got to a point where it’s no exception for a human being to unlock and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/millennials/ebooks/Millennials_And_Tech_At_Home_eBook_All_AK.pdf?ref=hackernoon.com">check their smartphone 150 times a day.</a>
</p>


<p>To spend two to three hours of your waking day stroking a glass rectangle.</p>
<p>Do you reach for your lover 150 times a day? Do you reach for your children, your family, your loved ones 150 times a day? Do you reach for your dreams? For the best possible version of you that you could ever hope to be?</p>


<p>Do you reach for your maximum potential for happiness 150 times a day?</p>

<p>I know I don’t. I’m addicted. But I’m changing that as we speak.</p>

<p>I’d like to share my story with you.</p>


<h2>My Personal Digital Transformation and Near-Burnout</h2>
<p>I’m in the middle of a near-burnout. And I think it started when I was in the middle of my five-year run with Motion10, the IT company that I used to work for as a digital marketing strategist.</p>


<p>You see at that time, I was — obviously — working as many knowledge workers nowadays, behind a screen for large parts of the day. The main skill I use in my line of work is gathering information, analyzing and structuring that information using a thought process that is known to most of us as writing.</p>


<p>I would say that I was probably looking at a screen for at least four to five hours per workday, just to get my basic writing work done.</p>


<p>But then, I’d also write for me. You see I am obsessed with writing, marketing and digital tech — the latter especially in relation to maximizing human potential. I find these all incredibly interesting and loved putting work into them.</p>


<p>So I wrote blogs, or sometimes poems, at times a mean of two or three per week.</p>
<p>And I wrote books. I published a book around two years ago, it was my debut novel,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://publish.sweek.com/shop/index.php/face-value-135450-publish-sweek-com.html?ref=hackernoon.com">Face Value</a>, and after that I’ve written two more books and have started on another.</p>


<p>Two years ago, while I was writing for my work for about five hours a day, I guess I was probably writing somewhere between two to three hours per day for my own little side projects. And I don’t know how many hours I was reading online.</p>
<div><p>And then I had social media.</p></div>

<h2>The Tsunami of Social&nbsp;Media</h2>
<p>I had my own personal accounts. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn, that I was reasonably active on at that time.</p>


<p>But then I was also the so-called social media manager for Motion10, as a natural part of my job. This meant managing a company account for LinkedIn, a LinkedIn group; a few Yammer (by Microsoft) accounts, two Facebook accounts, two Instagram accounts and two Twitter accounts, all for my day job.</p>


<p>And then I published my book, so I was promoting that — you guessed it — on social media.</p>


<p>I was managing all of these social media accounts and campaigns, and at the time I was very active about it so that we wouldn’t miss any interaction on any of these platforms. I was checking my mail pretty much 24/7 in case someone was trying to contact me .</p>


<p>I don’t think I’m very special for checking my mail around the clock, but just to be sure — does anybody else here have the tendency to do that?</p>


<p>Someone from work or a client of Motion10 might be trying to get in touch with me. Anyone could be trying to contact me regarding my book and/or its promotion. I didn’t want to miss anything.</p>


<p>And lastly, I was checking stats. I don’t know if you know any digital marketers but checking web analytics can become like a plague to us, a mental disease that gets you hopped-up on dopamine and adrenaline, and that leaves you distracted and exhausted.</p>


<p>I was not a fun person to be around.</p>


<p>I honestly think that our smartphones or our digital tech arelike a glass mirror, much like “<a href="https://medium.com/@limawrites/black-mirror-new-season-black-mirror-book-coming-soon-5363c04ef079?ref=hackernoon.com">Black Mirror</a>”, that is reflecting or making visible the things that work underneath the surface; the things that drive us. I think digital tech and the way we use it can be a perfect mirror for our personal transformation. It can help us elevate our consciousness.</p>


<h2>What I started noticing about&nbsp;myself</h2>
<p>It was around this time that I began noticing some things. In random order;</p>
<ul>
<li>I was starting to get really, really tired. Where I’d been used to not needing much more than 7,5 hours of sleep and feeling quite energetic, around this time I started having ‘exhaustion’ as a baseline energy level.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Was I taking good enough care of myself?</em>
</li>
<li>I was distracted all of the time. I was not present at all, when I was supposedly present with my fiancé, my children, my family or friends. My son who was about 8 or 9 at the time would routinely ask me or sometimes tell me to put the phone down when I was talking to him.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Was I getting my priorities in life straight?</em>
</li>
<li>I was unhappy, maybe due to lack of clear focus but definitely also because of lack of rest. I think there might be a limit to how much information a human being can naturally process over the course of a set amount of time.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I think I may well have been exceeding my limit.</em>
</li>
<li>I was lonely. Or I felt lonely. I had halfway chosen, consciously, to kind of scale down my social life as I realized working a full-time job, promoting a self-published book and being a husband and father was already probably a pretty heavy load. But my social life took a much more serious hit than I was expecting.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>What is the link between social connection and addiction?</em>
</li>
<li>I started feeling less and less motivated, focused and concentrated. First at work, then in doing my own projects, and then in pretty much everything I did in life.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>What do I really need to be happy?</em>Is there Life Beyond the Touch&nbsp;Screen?</li>
</ul>



<p>Because apart from noticing these things in myself, I started really noticing them in people around me as well. Digital distraction, in my fiancé or my own children; friends — the screen distracts from the conversation we are having right now, doesn’t it? Research indicates it even distracts when it’s just near you, even lying on a table, face down.</p>


<p>I started seeing the <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/smartphone-addiction-technology-dependency-science-and-statistics" target="_blank" title="Smartphone Addiction Statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer">true effects of digital tech addiction everywhere.</a> On the train, on the sidewalk, in cars, restaurants, bars, family get-togethers, meetings at work. I remember having conversations with people about it and they wouldn’t understand what I was saying — then check their smartwatch for messages.</p>


<p>My whole working life revolved around the relationship people had with tech at that time, and my own natural curiosity coupled with what I had started to notice in myself, had got me thinking. This is when I started writing the aphorisms, in social post-format;</p>
<blockquote>“Is there Life Beyond The Touch&nbsp;Screen?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Work mail can&nbsp;wait.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Touch Humans, not Screens.”</blockquote>
<p>This, coupled with some fragments of blog articles and a few poems together were the start of my newest book.</p>


<h3>Publishing and promoting a new book from a half-a-burnout</h3>

<p>Fast forward to just a couple of months ago.</p>


<p>I was sitting at the kitchen table with my fiancé, having coffee the morning after I had taken sick leave due to a splitting headache. We got to talking, and she cornered me. In a good way.</p>


<p>Hadn’t I been incredibly tired over the last two years? So much so that I had been saying for about two years now that I should go to the doctor’s for a check-up, to see if there wasn’t anything weird going on physically?</p>


<p>And wasn’t I kind of gloomy, slightly depressed, for a long time already? And wasn’t I also a bit edgy, easily irritated — with her, with the kids? …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div>

<p>If you have used <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bountysource.com/">Bountysource</a> in the past, you may have received an email announcing new terms of service that included a clause that would forfeit unclaimed bounties. On June 16, Bountysource sent this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are receiving this email because we are updating the Bountysource Terms of Service, effective 1st July 2020.</p>

  <h4 id="whats-changing">What’s changing?</h4>
  <p>We have added a Time-Out clause to the Bounties section of the agreement:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>2.13 Bounty Time-Out.</em></p>

    <p><em>If no Solution is accepted within two years after a Bounty is posted, then the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource. For Bounties posted before June 30, 2018, the Backer may redeploy their Bounty to a new Issue by contacting <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@<wbr>bountysource.com</a> before July 1, 2020. If the Backer does not redeploy their Bounty by the deadline, the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource.</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>…</p>
  <h4 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h4>
  <p>If you agree to the new terms, you don’t have to do anything… Or, if you do not agree with the new terms, please discontinue using Bountysource.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave open source projects and their bounty hunters just two weeks to act; oftentimes it would take <em>longer than that</em> to even get a response from the support team. The controversial terms have since been withdrawn—at least for now. On June 17, Bountysource sent the following message (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re receiving this because we updated our Terms of Service.</p>

<p>In December, 2017, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008103840/https://blog.canya.com/2017/12/20/canya-acquires-majority-stake-in-bountysource-adds-over-46000-users/">Bountysource was acquired</a> by a cryptocurrency company called CanYa who redesigned the Bountysource site and service with a new cryptocoin focus. In addition to the general friction we’ve experienced with using the service since to get developers paid, we feel like this policy change–even withdrawn–is concerning. It calls into question the future of Bountysource as a platform and the stability of their business model. While we understand that operating a platform incurs costs, we want to make sure that funds are primarily going to developers, not being automatically scooped up by corporate stakeholders.</p>

<p>These events have led us to re-think our recommendation and use of Bountysource. As such, we’ve removed Bountysource from our website, removed any Bountysource integration with elementary repos on GitHub, withdrawn our funds, and closed our account. For backers and bounty hunters on Bountysource, your bounties on elementary projects will automatically be returned to you. You may also wish to withdraw any funds and close your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@<wbr>bountysource.com</a>.</p>



<p>As an alternative, we recommend checking out <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">GitHub Sponsors</a>. We recently launched a few tiers on Sponsors, and have been very pleased with it.</p>

<p>You can directly sponsor <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">organizations like elementary</a>, as well as individual contributors. For elementary specifically, we have a new $50/month tier that offers the closest equivalent to a bug bounty program: each month, backers at this tier can comment on any elementary issue to get at least an hour of our investigation time. This is a great way to help steer development in the direction you see fit while also directly supporting us.</p>



<p>GitHub also covers payment processing and doesn’t charge any fees for GitHub Sponsors; this means <strong>100% of your sponsorship goes to elementary</strong> to help fund our work.</p>

<p>If GitHub Sponsors isn’t your cup of tea, you can also check out the funding section on our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding">Get Involved</a> page to see other ways you can help support elementary OS.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	
<p>It seems that coding skills are becoming less and less of a barrier to building and launching a successful application.</p>
<p>No-code tools have offered everyone from small businesses to enterprises the opportunity to achieve digital transformation both simply and sustainably. In the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johneverhard/2019/01/15/what-really-is-low-codeno-code-development/#61935a6f2a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words of Forbes contributor John Everhard</a>, no-code, as well as often-associated low-code, solutions help “build powerful applications that can scale for any organization—without writing any code.”</p>
<p>Everhard further discussed in his article the powerful impact that no-code tools, also known as codeless tools, can have. With these types of software, IT teams no longer need to spend 60% of their time keeping their current systems working. Instead, no-code solutions help companies maintain a competitive edge over their peers with up to a 75% improvement on time to market.</p>
<p>Industry analysts have taken note of the “no-code movement” as well, with <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/08/gartner-lcap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner predicting</a> that low-code application platforms (LCAP) will account for 65% of application development activity by 2024. Enterprises seem to be taking note as well, whether by <a href="https://www.testcraft.io/testcraft-joins-perforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring codeless tools</a> or by releasing no-code capabilities of their own.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is a list of different tools to keep on your radar in the no-code space. These tools cover every stage of application development, although there are other solutions that are not covered here, such as industry-specific solutions and payment applications.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>If you’re reading this wondering if you should stop using AES-GCM in some standard protocol (TLS 1.3), the short answer is “No, you’re fine”. </p>



<p>I specialize in secure implementations of cryptography, and my years of experience in this field have led me to dislike AES-GCM.</p>



<p>This post is about why I dislike AES-GCM’s design, not “why AES-GCM is insecure and should be avoided”. AES-GCM is still miles above what most developers reach for when they want to encrypt (e.g. <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin">ECB mode</a> or <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/">CBC mode</a>).</p>



<p>To be clear: This is solely my opinion and not representative of any company or academic institution.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-aes-gcm">What is AES-GCM?</h2>



<p>AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that uses the AES block cipher in counter mode with a polynomial MAC based on Galois field multiplication.</p>



<p>In order to explain why AES-GCM sucks, I have to first explain what I dislike about the AES block cipher. Then, I can describe why I’m filled with sadness every time I see the AES-GCM construction used.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-aes">What is AES?</h3>



<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specific subset of a block cipher called Rijndael.</p>



<p>Rijndael’s design is based on a substitution-permutation network, which broke tradition from many block ciphers of its era (including its predecessor, DES) in not using a Feistel network.</p>



<p>AES only includes three flavors of Rijndael: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. The difference between these flavors is the size of the key and the number of rounds used, but–and this is often overlooked–not the block size.</p>



<p>As a block cipher, AES always operates on 128-bit (16 byte) blocks of plaintext, regardless of the key size.</p>



<p>This is generally considered acceptable because AES is a secure pseudorandom permutation (PRP), which means that every possible plaintext block maps directly to one ciphertext block, and thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem">birthday collisions</a> are not possible. (A pseudorandom function (PRF), conversely, does have birthday bound problems.)</p>



<h3 id="why-aes-sucks">Why AES Sucks</h3>







<h4 id="side-channels">Side-Channels</h4>



<p>The biggest reason why AES sucks is that its design uses a lookup table (called an S-Box) <a href="https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding#avoid-table-look-ups-indexed-by-secret-data">indexed by secret data</a>, which is inherently vulnerable to cache-timing attacks (<a href="https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>



<p>There are workarounds for this AES vulnerability, but they either require hardware acceleration (AES-NI) or a technique called <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/tree/1.0.14/src/libsodium/crypto_stream/aes128ctr/nacl">bitslicing</a>.</p>



<p>The short of it is: With AES, you’re either using hardware acceleration,<em> or </em>you have to choose between performance and security. You cannot get fast, constant-time AES without hardware support.</p>



<h4 id="block-size">Block Size</h4>



<p>AES-128 is considered by experts to have a security level of 128 bits.</p>



<p>Similarly, AES-192 gets certified at 192-bit security, and AES-256 gets 256-bit security.</p>



<p><strong>However, the AES block size is only 128 bits!</strong></p>



<p>That might not sound like a big deal, but it severely limits the constructions you can create out of AES.</p>



<p>Consider the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)">AES-CBC</a>, where the output of each block of encryption is combined with the next block of plaintext (using XOR). This is typically used with a random 128-bit block (called the initialization vector, or IV) for the first block.</p>



<p>This means you expect a collision after encrypting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> (at 50% probability) blocks.</p>



<p>When you start getting collisions, you can break CBC mode, as this video demonstrates:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0IsYNDMV7A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>Their attack on CBC mode completely hand-waves away the block size detail that the demo depends on, but so long as you keep that in mind, their attack is valid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is significantly smaller than the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> you expect from AES.</p>



<h4 id="aes-post-quantum">Post-Quantum Security?</h4>



<p>Cryptographers estimate that AES-128 will have a post-quantum security level of  64 bits, AES-192 will have a post-quantum security level of 96 bits, and AES-256 will have a post-quantum security level of 128 bits.</p>



<p>This is because Grover’s quantum search algorithm can search <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="n" title="n"> unsorted items in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="\sqrt{n}" title="\sqrt{n}"> time, which can be used to reduce the total number of possible secrets from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{n}" title="2^{n}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="\sqrt{2^{n}}" title="\sqrt{2^{n}}">. This cuts the security level, expressed in bits, in half.</p>



<p><strong>But remember, even AES-256 operates on 128-bit blocks.</strong></p>



<p>Consequently, for AES-256, there should be approximately <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> (plaintext, key) pairs that produce any given ciphertext block.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there will be many keys that, for a constant plaintext block, will produce the same ciphertext block despite being a different key entirely. (n.b. This doesn’t mean for <em>all</em> plaintext/ciphertext block pairings, just some arbitrary pairing.)</p>



<p><strong>Concrete example:</strong> Encrypting a plaintext block consisting of sixteen NUL bytes will yield a specific 128-bit ciphertext exactly once for each given AES-128 key. However, there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> times as many AES-256 keys as there are possible plaintext/ciphertexts. Keep this in mind for AES-GCM.</p>



<p>This means it’s conceivable to accidentally construct a protocol that, despite using AES-256 safely, has a post-quantum security level on par with AES-128, which is only 64 bits.</p>



<p>This would <em>not</em> be nearly as much of a problem if AES’s block size was 256 bits.</p>



<h4 id="aes-signal-protocol">Real-World Example: Signal</h4>



<p>The Signal messaging app is the state-of-the-art for private communications. If you were previously <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">using PGP</a> and email, you should use Signal instead.</p>



<p>Signal aims to provide private communications (text messaging, voice calls) between two mobile devices, piggybacking on your pre-existing contacts list.</p>



<p>Part of their operational requirements is that they must be user-friendly and secure on a wide range of Android devices, stretching all the way back to Android 4.4.</p>



<p>The Signal Protocol uses <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/4f5e1ff299cea22cc75bb97249020a7da67b816d/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/SessionCipher.java#L395-L413">AES-CBC</a> + <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/4f5e1ff299cea22cc75bb97249020a7da67b816d/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/protocol/SignalMessage.java#L111-L139">HMAC-SHA256</a> for message encryption. Each message is encrypted with a different AES key (due to the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">Double Ratchet</a>), which limits the practical blast radius of a cache-timing attack and makes practical exploitation difficult (since you can’t effectively replay decryption in order to leak bits about the key).</p>



<p>Thus, Signal’s message encryption is still secure even in the presence of vulnerable AES implementations.</p>

<p>However, the storage service in the Signal App uses <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/c24d285cd3e93f32fbcd94c7296aa6ac3a6967d0/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/storage/SignalStorageCipher.java">AES-GCM</a>, and this key has to be reused in order for the encrypted storage to operate.</p>



<p>This means, for older phones without dedicated hardware support for AES (i.e. low-priced phones from 2013, which Signal aims to support), <strong>the risk of cache-timing attacks is still present</strong>.</p>

<p>What this means is, a malicious app that can flush the CPU cache and measure timing with sufficient precision can siphon the AES-GCM key used by Signal to encrypt your storage without ever violating the security boundaries enforced by the Android operating system.</p>



<p>As a result of the security boundaries never being crossed, these kind of side-channel attacks would likely evade forensic analysis, and would therefore be of interest to the malware developers working for nation states.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re on newer hardware (i.e. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835), you have hardware-accelerated AES available, so it’s probably a moot point.</p>



<h3 id="aes-gcm-worse">Why AES-GCM Sucks Even More</h3>



<p>AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that also supports additional authenticated data. Cryptographers call these modes <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">AEAD</a>.</p>



<p>AEAD modes are more flexible than simple block ciphers. Generally, your encryption API accepts the following:</p>



<ol><li>The plaintext message.</li><li>The encryption key.</li><li>A nonce (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bonce%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="n_{once}" title="n_{once}">: A number that must only be used once).</li><li>Optional additional data which will be authenticated but not encrypted.</li></ol>



<p>The output of an AEAD function is both the ciphertext and an authentication tag, which is necessary (along with the key and nonce, and optional additional data) to decrypt the plaintext.</p>



<p>Cryptographers almost universally recommend using AEAD modes for symmetric-key data encryption.</p>



<p>That being said, AES-GCM is possibly my least favorite AEAD, and I’ve got good reasons to dislike it beyond simply, “It uses AES”.</p>

<h4 id="ghash">GHASH Brittleness</h4>



<p>The way AES-GCM is initialized is stupid: You encrypt an all-zero block with your AES key (in ECB mode) and store it in a variable called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="H" title="H">. This value is used for authenticating all messages authenticated under that AES key, rather than for a given (key, nonce) pair.</p>

<p>This is often sold as an advantage: Reusing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="H" title="H"> allows for better performance. However, it makes GCM brittle: Reusing a nonce allows an attacker to recover H and then forge messages forever. This is called the “forbidden attack”, and led to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475">real world practical breaks</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s contrast AES-GCM with the other AEAD mode supported by TLS: ChaCha20-Poly1305, or ChaPoly for short.</p>



<p>ChaPoly uses one-time message authentication keys (derived from each key/nonce pair). If you manage to leak a Poly1305 key, the impact is limited to the messages encrypted under that (ChaCha20 key, nonce) pair.</p>



<p>While that’s still <em>bad</em>, it isn’t “decrypt all messages under that key forever” bad like with AES-GCM.</p>



<h4 id="short-nonces">Short Nonces</h4>



<p>Although the AES block size is 16 bytes, AES-GCM nonces are only 12 bytes. The latter 4 bytes are dedicated to an internal counter, which is used with AES in Counter Mode to actually encrypt/decrypt messages. </p>



<p>(Yes, you can use arbitrary length nonces with AES-GCM, but if you use nonces longer than 12 bytes, they get hashed into 12 bytes anyway, so it’s not a detail most people should concern themselves with.)</p>



<p>If you ask a cryptographer, “How much can I encrypt safely with AES-GCM?” you’ll get two different answers.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Message Length Limit: </strong>AES-GCM can be used to encrypt messages up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B36%7D+-+32&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{36} - 32" title="2^{36} - 32"> bytes long, under a given (key, nonce) pair.</li><li><strong>Number of Messages Limit: </strong>If you generate your nonces randomly, you have a 50% chance of a nonce collision after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B48%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{48}" title="2^{48}"> messages.<p>However, 50% isn’t conservative enough for most systems, so the safety margin is usually much lower. Cryptographers generally set the key wear-out of AES-GCM at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> …</p></li></ol></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Deutsch’s Algorithm is the simplest quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a slightly contrived problem. Suppose we have a black-box function $f(x)$ which maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. It is easy to speculate that there are four possible mappings for $f(x)$. We call the function $f(x)$ constant if $f(0) = f(1)$, otherwise we call the function $f(x)$ balanced.</p>



<p>With a classical computer, we would have to run the black-box $f(x)$ twice to evaluate $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ and compare the values of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ to see if they are equivalent or not. With a quantum computer, because we could take advantage of superposition, probably we could do better with fewer runs and operations.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the Deutsch’s Algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="separable-and-entangled-states">Separable and Entangled States</h4>

<p>States that can be broken into the Kronecker product of states from the constituent subsystems are called separable states, whereas states that are unbreakable are referred to as entangled states.</p>



<p>For example, we have the following two states $| \psi \rangle$ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>$| \psi \rangle$ is separable and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ is entangled.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-quantum-operator">Unitary Quantum Operator</h4>

<p>Every quantum operator $U$ is unitary and thus reversible. Because $UU^{\dagger} = U^{\dagger}U = I$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Hardmard operator is a special quantum operator.</p>



<p>Notice that $H^{\dagger} = H$, therefore</p>











<h4 id="an-equation">An Equation</h4>

<p>If $f(x)$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$, we have</p>



<p>Where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>

<h3 id="deutschs-algorithm">Deutsch’s Algorithm</h3>

<p>The black-box $f(x)$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$. Just like the classical gate for $f(x)$, it has four possible candidates. Our job is to determine whether the $f(x)$ corresponding to the $U_f$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/Uf.png">
    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle$ to $| x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$, namely $U_f (| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$, for $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$. When $y = 0$, $| y \oplus f(x) \rangle = | 0 \oplus f(x) \rangle = | f(x) \rangle $, $| y \oplus f(x) \rangle$ is just $| f(x) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is only valid when $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are basic qubit states $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. When $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, the mapping does not necessarily hold.</p>



<p>Let’s further check when $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, what the outputs from $U_f$ will be. Perhaps we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h4>

<p>In the first attempt, we made the first qubit input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the input basic state $|0\rangle$. The superposition is</p>



<p>The second qubit input to $U_f$ is just a normal  basic state $|0\rangle$.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>First Attempt</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>If $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, one of the balanced cases,</p>



<p>Note that this $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is entangled and could be be expressed as the Kronecker product of two qubits. The first qubit output from $U_f$ is not $H|0\rangle$ either. In fact it could not be described using single qubit! The two qubits must be described as a whole due to quantum entanglement. When we observe either the first qubit output or the second qubit output, we immediately know the observation of the other qubit. For example, if we observed the second qubit is 0, we know the observation of the first qubit must be 0. There are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for both the first qubit and the second qubit.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 0$, one of the balanced cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is entangled and there are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for both the first qubit and the second qubit.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 0$, one of the constant cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is separable. Although we are not sure the exact state the two qubit outputs would be in, due to the phase is not defined, we are sure that the observation of the bottom qubit must be 0.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 1$, one of the constant cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is separable. Although we are not sure the exact state the two qubit outputs would be in, due to the phase is not defined, we are sure that the observation of the bottom qubit must be 1.</p>



<p>However, all of these are not helpful if we are only allowed to run once. After running once, no matter what we observed from the first qubit and the second qubit, we are not sure whether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second Attempt</h4>

<p>In the second attempt, we made the second qubit input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the input basic state $|1\rangle$. The superposition is</p>



<p>The second qubit input to $U_f$ is a variable and it could be either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/attempt-2.png">
    <figcaption>Second Attempt</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>Because $\frac{|f(x)\rangle - |\overline{f(x)}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ is either $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\frac{|1\rangle - |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|\varphi_2\rangle $ could be further simplified as</p>



<p>The observation from the first qubit output is always the same to the first qubit input, whereas there are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for the second qubit.</p>



<p>This provides no information of determining whether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced either.</p>

<h4 id="third-attempt">Third Attempt</h4>

<p>In the third attempt, we made the both qubit inputs to $U_f$ superpositions. The superpositions for the first qubit and the second qubit are $H|0\rangle$ and $H|1\rangle$, respectively.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/deutsch-algorithm.png">
    <figcaption>Deutsch's Algorithm</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>Note that if $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$, $f(x)$ is constant; if $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$, $f(x)$ is balanced. This information is encoded in the phase of the first qubit. How could we extract this key information?</p>



<p>We noticed that in the first qubit output $|0\rangle + (-1)^{f(0) \oplus f(1)} |1\rangle$ is either $|0\rangle + |1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$ or $|0\rangle - |1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$. Applying a Hadamard operator to it results in $|0\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$ or $|1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$.</p>



<p>This means if $f(x)$ is constant, we must observe 0 for the first qubit whereas if $f(x)$ is balanced, we must observe 1 for the first qubit. Therefore, we are able to determine if $f(x)$ is constant or balanced using such quantum circuits.</p>



<p>Conventionally, we compare algorithms on the same platform, either it is a classical computer or a quantum computer. However, in our case, it is a little bit weird that the classical algorithm is using classical gate whereas the quantum algorithm uses quantum gate, yet we still have to compare the two algorithms. Therefore, in my opinion, such comparison is not fair.</p>

<pre>#======= THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 4.2.0, 31 JAN 2000 =======#
</pre>

<p>This is the Jargon File, a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang
illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.

</p><p>This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely
used, shared, and modified.  There are (by intention) no legal
restraints on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about
its proper use to which many hackers are quite strongly attached. 
Please extend the courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File,
ideally with a version number, as it will change and grow over time. 
(Examples of appropriate citation form: "Jargon File 4.2.0" or
"The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 4.2.0, 31 JAN 2000".)

</p><p>The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture. 
Over the years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable
time to maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large
as editors of it.  Editorial responsibilities include: to collate
contributions and suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating
information; to cross-reference related entries; to keep the file in a
consistent format; and to announce and distribute updated versions
periodically.  Current volunteer editors include:

</p><p>	Eric Raymond 	<a href="mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</a>

</p><p>Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good
form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published work
or commercial product.  We may have additional information that would be
helpful to you and can assist you in framing your quote to reflect
not only the letter of the File but its spirit as well.

</p><p>All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
public-domain file.

</p><p>From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,
and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the
volunteer editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to
have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to
purchase one of these.  They often contain additional material not
found in on-line versions.  The two `authorized' editions so far are
described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the
future.

<p>This document is a collection of slang terms used by various
subcultures of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is
included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;
what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for
fun, social communication, and technical debate.

</p><p>The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,
it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional
culture less than 40 years old.

</p><p>As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold
their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's
places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences. 
Also as usual, <em>not</em> knowing the slang (or using it
inappropriately) defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of
all in hackish vocabulary) possibly even a <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>.  All human
cultures use slang in this threefold way -- as a tool of
communication, and of inclusion, and of exclusion.

</p><p>Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps
in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard
to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are
code for shared states of <em>consciousness</em>.  There is a whole
range of altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to
high-level hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic
reality any better than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's
`trompe l'oeil' compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and
hacker slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a
simple example, take the distinction between a <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> and an
<b><a href="#elegant">elegant</a></b> solution, and the differing connotations attached to each. 
The distinction is not only of engineering significance; it reaches
right back into the nature of the generative processes in program
design and asserts something important about two different kinds of
relationship between the hacker and the hack.  Hacker slang is
unusually rich in implications of this kind, of overtones and
undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche.

</p><p>But there is more.  Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very
conscious and inventive in their use of language.  These traits seem
to be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine
we are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of
most of us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic invention in most
subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious
process.  Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a
game to be played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus
display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of
language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful
intelligence.  Further, the electronic media which knit them together
are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination
of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated
specimens.  The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely
intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.

</p><p>Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and
anthropological assumptions.  For example, it has recently become
fashionable to speak of `low-context' versus `high-context'
communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level
of their languages and art forms.  It is usually claimed that
low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and
completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures
which value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by
contrast, high-context communication (elliptical, emotive,
nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures
which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.  What
then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely
low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
"low-context" values, but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context
slang style?

</p><p>The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a
compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the
surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version
of an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File', maintained by
hackers themselves for over 15 years.  This one (like its ancestors)
is primarily a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect
background or sidelight information on hacker culture that would be
awkward to try to subsume under individual slang definitions.

</p><p>Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that
the material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should
find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is
amusingly thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use
humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements
about what they feel.  Some of these entries reflect the views of
opposing sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this
is deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these
disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that <em>everyone's</em>
sacred cows get gored, impartially.  Compromise is not particularly a
hackish virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints
is.

</p><p>The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt
it either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences
-- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will benefit
from them.

</p><p>A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included
in <b><a href="#Appendix%20A">Appendix A</a></b>. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly
directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in <b><a href="#Appendix%20B">Appendix B</a></b>. 
Appendix C, the <b><a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a></b>, lists some non-technical works
which have either influenced or described the hacker culture.

</p><p>Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between …</p></div>

		<p>Between roughly 1975 and 1995, access to computers accelerated much more quickly than access to computer networks. First in the United States, and then in other wealthy countries, computers became commonplace in the homes of the affluent, and nearly ubiquitous in institutions of higher education. But if users of those computers wanted to connect their machines together – to exchange email, download software, or find a community where they could discuss their favorite hobby, they had few options. Home users could connect to services like CompuServe. But, until the introduction of flat monthly fees in the late 1980s, they charged by the hour at rates relatively few could afford. Some university students and faculty could connect to a packet-switched computer network, but many more could not. By 1981, only about 280 computers had access to ARPANET. CSNET and BITNET would eventually connect hundreds more, but they only got started in the early 1980s. At that time the U.S. counted more than 3,000 institutions of higher education, virtually all of which would have had multiple computers, ranging from large mainframes to small workstations.</p>
<p>Both communities, home hobbyists and those academics who were excluded from the big networks, turned to the same technological solution to connect to one another. They hacked the plain-old telephone system, the Bell network, into a kind of telegraph, carrying digital messages instead of voices, and relaying messages from computer to computer across the country and the world.</p>
<p>These were among the earliest peer-to-peer computer networks. Unlike CompuServe and other such centralized systems, onto which home computers latched to drink down information like so many nursing calves, information spread through these networks like ripples on a pond, starting from anywhere and ending up everywhere. Yet they still became rife with disputes over politics and power. In the late 1990s, as the Internet erupted into popular view, many claimed that it would flatten social and economic relations. By enabling anyone to connect with anyone, the middle men and bureaucrats who had dominated our lives would find themselves cut out of the action. A new era of direct democracy and open markets would dawn, where everyone had an equal voice and equal access. Such prophets might have hesitated had they reflected on what happened on Usenet and Fidonet in the 1980s. Be its technical substructure ever so flat, every computer network is embedded within a community of human users. And human societies, no matter how one kneads and stretches, always seem to keep their lumps.</p>
<h2>Usenet</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Tom Truscott was living the dream life for a young computer nerd. A grad student in computer science at Duke University with an interest in computer chess, he landed an internship at Bell Labs’ New Jersey headquarters, where he got to rub elbows with the creators of Unix, the latest craze to sweep the world of academic computing.</p>
<p>The origins of Unix, like those of the Internet itself, lay in the shadow of American telecommunications policy. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs decided in the late 1960s to build a leaner, much pared-down version of the massive MIT Multics system to which they had contributed as software developers. The new operating system quickly proved a hit within the labs, popular for its combination of low overhead (allowing it to run on even inexpensive machines) and high flexibility. However, AT&amp;T could do little to profit from their success. A 1956 agreement with the Justice Department required AT&amp;T to license non-telephone technologies to all comers at a reasonable rate, and to stay out of all business sectors other than supplying common carrier communications.</p>
<p>So AT&amp;T began to license Unix to universities for use in academic settings on very generous terms. These early licensees, who were granted access to the source code, began building and selling their own Unix variants, most notably the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix created at the the University of California’s flagship campus. The new operating system quickly swept academia. Unlike other popular operating systems, such as the DEC TENEX / TOPS-20, it could run on hardware from a variety of vendors, many of them offering very low-cost machines. And Berkeley distributed the software for only a nominal fee, in addition to the modest licensing fee from AT&amp;T.<sup id="fnref-13802-fee"><a href="#fn-13802-fee">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Truscott felt that he sat at the root of all things, therefore, when he got to spend the summer as Ken Thompson’s intern, playing a few morning rounds of volleyball before starting work at midday, sharing a pizza dinner with his idols, and working late into the night slinging code on Unix and the C programming language. He did not want to give up the connection to that world when his internship ended, and so as soon as he returned to Duke in the fall, he figured out how to connect the computer science department’s Unix-equipped PDP 11/70 back to the mothership in Murray Hill, using a program written by one of his erstwhile colleagues, Mike Lesk. It was called <em><span>uucp</span></em> – Unix to Unix copy – and it was one of a suite of “uu” programs new to the just-released Unix Version 7, which allowed one Unix system to connect to another over a modem. Specifically, <em>uucp</em> allowed one to copy files back and forth between the two connected computers, which allowed Truscott to exchange email with Thompson and Ritchie.</p>

<p>It was Truscott’s fellow grad student, Jim Ellis, who had installed the new Version 7 on the Duke computer, but even as the new upgrade gave with one hand, it took away with the other. The news program that was distributed by the Unix users’ group, USENIX, which would broadcast news items to all users of a given Unix computer system, no longer worked on the new operating ssytem. Truscott and Ellis decided they would replace it with their own 7-compatible news program, with more advanced features, and return their improved software back to the community for a little bit of prestige.</p>
<p><span>At this same time, Truscott was also using <em>uucp</em> to connect with a Unix machine at the University of North Carolina ten miles to the southwest in Chapel Hill, and talking to a grad student there named Steve Bellovin.<sup id="fnref-13802-bellovin"><a href="#fn-13802-bellovin">2</a></sup> Bellovin had also started building his own news program, which notably included the concept of topic-based <em>newsgroups</em>, to which one could subscribe, rather than only having a single broadcast channel for all news. Bellovin, Truscot and Ellis decided to combine their efforts and build a networked news system with newsgroups, that would use <em>uucp</em> to share news between sites. They intended to distributed provide Unix-related news for USENIX members, so they called their system Usenet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Duke would serve as the central clearinghouse at first, using its auto-dialer and <em>uucp</em> to connect to each other site on the network at regular intervals, in order to pick up it local news updates and deposit updates from its peers. Bellovin wrote the initial code, but it used shell scripts that operated very slowly, so Stephen Daniel, another Duke grad student, rewrote the program in C. Daniel’s version became know as A News. Ellis promoted the program at the January 1980 Usenix conference in Boulder, Colorado, and gave away all eighty copies of the software that he had brought with him. By the next Usenix conference that summer, the organizers had added A News to the general software package that they distributed to all attendees.</p>
<p>The creators described the system, cheekily, as a “poor man’s ARPANET.” Though one may not be accustomed to thinking of Duke as underprivileged, it did not have the clout in the world of computer science necessary at the time to get a connection to that premiere American computer network. But access to Usenet required no one’s permission, only a Unix system, a modem, and the ability to pay the phone bills for regular news transfers, requirements that virtually any institution of higher education could meet by the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Private companies also joined up with Usenet, and helped to facilitate the spread of the network. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) agreed to act as an intermediary between Duke and UC Berkeley, footing the long-distance telephone bills for inter-coastal data transfer. This allowed Berkeley to become a second, west-coast hub for Usenet, connecting up UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, and others, including Sytek, an early LAN business. The connection to Berkeley, an ARPANET site, also enabled cross-talk between ARPANET and Usenet (after a second re-write by Mark Horton and Matt Glickman to create B News). ARPANET sites began picking up Usenet content and vice versa, though ARPA rules technically forbid interconnection with other networks. The network grew rapidly, from fifteen sites carrying ten posts a day in in 1980, to 600 sites and 120 posts in 1983, and 5000 sites and 1000 posts in 1987.<sup id="fnref-13802-sitesandposts"><a href="#fn-13802-sitesandposts">3</a></sup></p>

However they left the system entirely open for expansion. Anyone was free to create a new group under “net”, and users very quickly added non-technical topics such as <em>net.jokes</em>. Just as one was free to send whatever one chose, recipients could also ignore whatever groups they chose, e.g. a system could join Usenet and request data only for <em>net.v7bugs,</em> ignoring the rest of the content. Quite unlike the carefully planned ARPANET, Usenet self-organized, and grew in an anarchic way overseen by no central authority.</p>
<p>Yet out of this superficially democratic medium a hierarchical order quickly emerged, with a certain subset of highly-connected, high-traffic sites recognized as the “backbone” of the system. This process developed fairly naturally. Because each transfer of data from one …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>June 24, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Sometimes, you will hear the view that Unix's design is without
significant issues, especially the 'pure' design of Research Unix
(before people who didn't really understand Unix like Berkeley and
corporate AT&amp;T got their hands on it). Unfortunately that is not
the case, and there are some areas where Research Unix made decisions
that still haunt us to this day. For reasons beyond the scope of
this entry, today's example is that part of the file attributes
that you get from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/stat.2"><code>stat()</code></a> system
call and its friends is the 'device number' of the filesystem the
file is on.</p>

<p>(To be specific, this is the <code>st_dev</code> field of the <code>struct stat</code>
that <code>stat()</code> returns, which has been since <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/include/sys/stat.h">V7's stat.h</a>.
The <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/man/man2/stat.2">V6 stat()</a> was
even more explicit about what it was returning.)</p>

<p>In Unix, the user level file attributes you get back need some kind
of locally unique identifier for the filesystem that the file is
on, so the presence of some identifier is not a mistake. The
identifier being different between two files is how you detect
things like that you're at a filesystem mount point, that you can't
use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/link.2"><code>link()</code></a>, or that two otherwise
identical looking files are not actually hardlinked together because
they're on different filesystems. It's also useful to have an
identifier that can be matched up with things like a list of mounted
filesystems.</p>

<p>However, early Unixes didn't make this merely some identifier, they
made this specifically the device number of the underlying disk
device that the filesystem was mounted from (hence its name as
'<code>st_dev</code>'). This had the unfortunate consequence of permanently
joining two logically separate identifier namespaces, the namespace
of (mounted) filesystems and the namespace of block devices.</p>

<p>Now, 40 odd years later, we have plenty of Unix filesystems that
don't have underlying block devices (especially singular ones).
Anything mounted using one of these filesystems needs to somehow
make up a 'device number' for itself, and this device number can't
be the same as any real block device. This generally requires Unixes
to carve out a section of their overall block device numbers that's
reserved for filesystems to do this with, in other words things
that aren't actually block devices. Fortunately modern Unixes have
generally made the namespace of device numbers be much larger than
it used to be.</p>

<p>(Then because device numbers for block devices are generally stable,
a certain amount of software expects the 'device number' returned as
part of file attributes to also be stable, for any arbitrary filesystem.
When the kernel and a filesystem has to make this number up on the fly,
this is not always the case.)</p>

<p>At the same time, this is a good design for V7 itself, in the time and
the context. V7 and its kernel were intended to be a small system, and
in a small system you don't want to go doing extra work unless you
absolutely have to, especially in the kernel. V7 could reuse the device
number to be the filesystem identifier essentially for free, so that's
what it did.</p>

<p>(V7's kernel took any number of shortcuts in the interests of having
a simple implementation. For instance, a lot of things were stored
in small fixed-sized arrays, because you would never have more than
a modest number of processes, open files, or so on.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Many laptop users choose to undervolt their machines. This decreases thermal output, which, in turn, can increase program performance, since modern CPUs will automatically adjust their operating frequency depending on the available thermal headroom. Undervolting tools exist for all major operating systems; they typically require administrator rights, but otherwise are easy to use. In Linux, however, things aren't quite so simple: recent versions of the kernel prohibit the mechanism used for undervolting Intel CPUs when SecureBoot is enabled. The most common way around this, unsurprisingly, is just to disable SecureBoot. With a bit of work, though, it is possible to keep SecureBoot enabled, but allow controlled access to the undervolting mechanism.</p>
<p>The next sections will go into some background information on undervolting, SecureBoot, and why newer versions of Linux prevent the former while the latter is enabled. You can skip any of these if you're already familiar with the topic.</p>

<p>Some laptops today are well-known for having thermal issues. A common culprit is that these laptops ship with voltage settings that are higher than actually required. This is a good default behavior, since chips' performance can vary significantly, even within a SKU. High-end chips that are put into more expensive models of these laptops, however, tend to be better binned, and often work without errors at substantially lower voltage. Since all modern chips implement some sort of "auto-overclock" when there is enough thermal headroom, this can translate into increased clock speeds, and thus, better performance.</p>
<p>My current laptop is a Dell XPS 15 7590, with an 8-core Intel® i9-9980HK. This particular model performs better compared to its predecessors, but there is still room for improvement. Unfortunately, Dell's UEFI provides no way to control the voltage settings, so any adjustments must be done after booting up.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F">Debian Wiki</a> has a great explanation of SecureBoot and Machine Owner Keys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UEFI Secure Boot (SB) is a verification mechanism for ensuring that code launched by a computer's UEFI firmware is trusted. It is designed to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating system has been loaded. SB works using cryptographic checksums and signatures. Each program that is loaded by the firmware includes a signature and a checksum, and before allowing execution the firmware will verify that the program is trusted by validating the checksum and the signature. When SB is enabled on a system, any attempt to execute an untrusted program will not be allowed. This stops unexpected / unauthorized code from running in the UEFI environment.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A key part of the shim design is to allow users to control their own systems. The distro CA key is built in to the shim binary itself, but there is also an extra database of keys that can be managed by the user, the so-called Machine Owner Key (MOK for short).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Large distros, like Ubuntu, ship with kernels signed by the same CA key used by Microsoft for Windows. This lets them be installed onto systems with SecureBoot without making the user go through the hassle of registering their own MOK and signing the kernel manually. If you want to run any custom kernel modules, however, you must create and register a MOK with the UEFI, and sign the driver(s) with it, or the kernel will refuse the load them.</p>

<p>Intel CPUs have had MSRs—<em>model-specific registers</em>—for quite some time. All sorts of tracing and debugging functionality is available through them, but, importantly for this topic, this is also how they provide a way to dynamically adjust voltages applied to the core and caches of the CPU. More troubling, though, is that these registers can also be used to violate protection rings, allowing user applications to read <em>and write</em> over kernel memory, including kernel code. This is why applications that use the MSRs have always required some sort of elevated privileges.</p>
<p>Previously, programs that wrote to the MSRs only required the <code>SYS_RAWIO</code> capability in Linux. Recent version of the kernel, however, don't allow any writes to the MSRs whatsoever when SecureBoot is enabled. (In kernel parlance, this is called "lockdown mode.") The motivation here is sound: the entire purpose of SecureBoot is to have a trusted environment that runs only the exact code that's been authorized, so any mechanism that potentially allows modification of kernel code at runtime flies in the face of that goal.</p>
<p>There has been at least <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/38d18a24-c580-d56b-f0cd-91e8184e1f0d@gmail.com/T/">one recent proposal</a> to open up the subset of MSRs used for undervolting, even when the kernel is locked down. A consensus hasn't yet been reached, though, so for the time being, we must come up with our own solutions.</p>

<p>tl;dr: the easiest way to allow undervolting in Linux while using SecureBoot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate your own MOK and register it with the UEFI.</li>
<li>Patch the <code>msr</code> module to remove the checks for lockdown mode.</li>
<li>Build, sign, and install the patched module.</li>
<li>Install an undervolting tool, like <code>intel-undervolt</code>, and give it the
<code>RAW_IO</code> capability.</li>
<li>Rejoice!</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, Ubuntu 20.04 uses kernel v5.4.0, and the patch looks like this:</p>

                        err = -EFAULT;
                break;
</span></pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward: look for all instances of <code>LOCKDOWN_MSR</code> in this file,
and comment-out the lockdown check &amp; error-handling code.</p>

<p>For all tests, these are the undervolt settings:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>ΔmV</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CPU Core</td><td>-99.6mV</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPU Cache</td><td>-99.6mV</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The first test is running Prime95 with default settings. Starting with the undervolt applied, I let the CPU frequency and temperature settle. Then, I set the voltage to stock settings, and let the system settle again. Measurements were done using the <code>intel-undervolt</code> tool. Here's the averaged &amp; rounded results:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Voltages</th><th>CPU Core (W)</th><th>CPU Core (°C)</th><th>CPU Core (Hz)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Stock</td><td>38 W</td><td>92 °C</td><td>2350 Hz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Undervolted</td><td>34 W</td><td>92 °C</td><td>2950 Hz</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To see how this change would affect a realistic workload for myself, I compiled the latest trunk branches of Firefox and alacritty. Both of these runs were done with the same settings, and with a clean build tree.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Voltages</th><th>Firefox Time (s)</th><th>alacritty time (s)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Stock</td><td>1401 s</td><td>139 s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Undervolted</td><td>1273 s</td><td>129 s</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These are only brief, non-rigorous tests, but the results suggest that undervolting can provide tangible benefits.</p>

<p>The obvious objection to this solution, of course, is that it makes SecureBoot useless. Or does it? If your system has multiple tenants, some of whom require the ability to grant programs the <code>SYS_RAWIO</code> capability, then this objection holds water. For the vast majority of laptop users, though, this isn't a threat. The owner decides which programs are allowed to perform raw I/O, and is responsible for their own security.</p>
<p>As for the common solution to this problem—disabling SecureBoot entirely—the drawbacks are pretty clear: you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, abandoning any sense of security and peace-of-mind that comes from cryptographic verification of your operating system. Users shouldn't have to sacrifice critical security features for acceptable performance.</p>
<p>The best solution would satisfy the needs of both server and desktop use cases. If the kernel had an interface to control undervolting, without providing access to the raw MSRs, then we could have the best of both worlds: no way to violate the SecureBoot contract from userspace, and laptop users can get better performance. Designing a good, reusable interface for this would undoubtedly take some time; we don't want it to be married specifically to one vendor, architecture, or platform. Until such an interface gets made and merged, we'll have to stick to workarounds.</p>

<p>Undervolting can provide noticeable benefits for many laptop configurations. Unfortunately, some OEMs prevent adjusting these settings in their UEFI, requiring the use of runtime mechanisms. Even <em>more</em> unfortunately, the mechanism for Intel CPUs also comes with potential security holes, which make it a challenge to provide this functionality in a way that completely complies with protocols like SecureBoot. Linux, in particular, takes the most conservative approach, absolutely forbidding access to undervolting mechanisms when running under a secure context. That is a sane starting point, but it would certainly be worthwhile to figure out an acceptable solution.</p>

<p>I have twice migrated large JavaScript apps to PureScript. At CitizenNet we replaced Angular with Halogen, and at Awake Security we’ve replaced most of a React application with PureScript React. Both companies have seen a dramatic drop in bugs in production.</p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to replace React due to PureScript’s <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> libraries. The React mental model fits well with a strongly-typed, pure functional language like PureScript (or Reason), and using the same underlying library means that components can be shared between languages with little modification.</p>

<p>At Awake Security we share internationalization, a Redux store and middleware, and much more in an code base where PureScript regularly imports JavaScript and JavaScript regularly imports PureScript.</p>

<p>The best way to rewrite a significant app from one language to another is incrementally, while it runs. At first the new language can take over logically isolated parts of the app: the management dashboard, or the chat window, or a form. But eventually you must mix components from both languages together – for example, to support shared global state.</p>

<p>At this point you can’t just let the new language take over a DOM node. You need to support simple, clear features for intermixing the languages. Fortunately, you can transform the interface of idiomatic PureScript code into idiomatic JavaScript (and vice versa). With <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> you can write business logic in PureScript but easily interoperating with the larger React ecosystem and your existing code.</p>

<p>In this article I will demonstrate how to replace part of a React application with simple components written in PureScript. Along the way, I’ll share best practices for making this interop convenient and dependable. The examples will be simple, but the same techniques also apply to complex components.</p>

</ol>

<p>I encourage you to code along with this article; no code is omitted and dependencies are pinned to help ensure the examples are reproducible. This code uses Node <code>v11.1.0</code>, Yarn <code>v1.12.0</code>, and NPX <code>v6.5.0</code> installed globally, and PureScript tooling installed locally.</p>

<p>Peter Murphy has <a href="https://github.com/ptrfrncsmrph/purescript-react-tutorial">implemented the ideas in this article using React Hooks</a> if you’d like to see this in action.</p>




<h2 id="let-s-write-a-react-app-in-javascript">Let’s write a React app in JavaScript</h2>

<p>We are going to write a tiny React application which shows a few counters, and then we’re going to replace its components with PureScript. The resulting JavaScript code will be indistinguishable, aside from imports, from the original, and yet it will all be PureScript under the hood.</p>

<p>Let’s follow the official React docs in using <code>create-react-app</code> to initialize the project and then trim our source code to the bare minimum.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Create the app</span>
npx create-react-app my-app <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> my-app</code></pre></div>
<p>At the time of writing, <code>create-react-app</code> produces these React dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"react"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-dom"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.0.1"</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a handful of source files under <code>src</code>, but our application will need just two of them: <code>index.js</code>, the entrypoint for Webpack, and <code>App.js</code>, the root component of our application. We can delete the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Delete all the source files except for the entrypoint and</span>
<span># root app component</span>
find src -type f -not <span>\(</span> -name <span>'index.js'</span> -or -name <span>'App.js'</span> <span>\)</span> -delete</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, let’s replace the contents of those two files with the bare minimum we’ll need for this article. From here on out I’ll supply diffs that you can supply to <code>git apply</code> to apply the same changes I did.</p>

<p>First, our entrypoint:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ReactDOM</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-dom"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>App</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./App"</span><span>;</span>

<span>ReactDOM</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(&lt;</span><span>App</span> <span>/&gt;,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>));</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then our main app component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>My</span> <span>App</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>App</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="writing-a-react-component">Writing a React component</h3>

<p>Let’s write our first React component: a counter. This is likely the first example of a React component you ever encountered; it’s the first example in the PureScript React libraries as well. It’s also small and simple enough to be replaced twice over the course of this article.</p>

<p>The counter will be a button which maintains the number of times it has been clicked. It will accept, as its only prop, a label to display on the button.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/Counter.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Counter</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>);</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>render</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{()</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>({</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>})}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span>
      <span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Counter</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we’ll import our new counters into our main application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,9 +1,13 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";
<span>+import Counter from "./Counter";
</span><span></span>
 function App() {
   return (
     &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;
<span>+      &lt;Counter label="Count" /&gt;
</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Clicks" /&gt;
</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Interactions" /&gt;
</span><span></span>     &lt;/div&gt;
   );
 }
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>yarn start</code> we can run the dev server and see our app in action.</p>

<p><img src="https://thomashoneyman.com/images/2019/running-app.gif" alt="running app"></p>



<p>We’ve written entirely too much JavaScript. Let’s support PureScript in this project as well. Our goal is to write code in either language and freely import in either direction without friction. To accomplish that, we will install PureScript tooling, create a separate PureScript source directory, and rely on the compiler to generate JavaScript code.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-compiler-and-package-manager">1. Install the compiler and package manager</h3>

<p>First we must install PureScript tooling. I recommend installing versions of the compiler and Spago (a package manager and build tool) which match those used in this article. I’ll use NPX to ensure all commands are run using local copies.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Install the compiler and the Spago package manager however you prefer;</span>
<span># since we're already in a React project I'll use Yarn</span>
yarn add -D purescript@0.13.2 spago@0.8.4</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="2-initialize-the-project-and-package-set">2. Initialize the project and package set</h3>

<p>We can create a new PureScript project with <code>spago init</code>. As of version 0.8.4, Spago always initializes with the same package set, which means you should have identical package versions to those used to write this article. I’m using the <code>psc-0.13.0-20190607</code> package set.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># npx ensures we're using our local copy of Spago installed in node_modules.</span>
npx spago init</code></pre></div>
<p>Spago has created a <code>packages.dhall</code> file which points at the set of packages which can be installed and a <code>spago.dhall</code> file which lists the packages we’ve actually installed. We can now install any dependencies we need and we’ll know for sure the versions are all compatible.</p>

<p>Before installing anything, let’s update the existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to cover PureScript. For a Spago-based project this will work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>echo</span> -e <span>"\noutput\n.psc*\n.purs*\.spago"</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3-adjust-the-directory-structure">3. Adjust the directory structure</h3>

<p>Finally, let’s organize our source code. It’s typical to separate JavaScript source from PureScript source except when writing an FFI file for PureScript. Since we aren’t doing that in this project, our source files will be entirely separated. Let’s move all JavaScript code into a <code>javascript</code> subdirectory and create a new <code>purescript</code> folder next to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir src/javascript src/purescript
mv src/App.js src/Counter.js src/javascript</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we’ll adjust <code>index.js</code> to the new location of our root component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";
 import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
<span>-import App from "./App";
</span><span></span><span>+import App from "./javascript/App";
</span><span></span>
 ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"));
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’ve just one task left. The PureScript compiler generates JavaScript into a directory named <code>output</code> in the root of the project. But <code>create-react-app</code> disables importing anything outside the <code>src</code> directory. While there are fancier solutions, for this project we’ll get around the restriction by symlinking the <code>output</code> directory into the <code>src</code> directory.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># we can now import compiled PureScript from src/output/...</span>
ln -s <span>$PWD</span>/output <span>$PWD</span>/src</code></pre></div>
<p>Your <code>src</code> directory should now look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">src
├── index.js
├── javascript
│ ├── App.js
│ └── Counter.js
├── output -&gt; ../output
└── purescript</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="replacing-a-react-component-with-purescript-react">Replacing a React component with PureScript React</h2>

<p>I like to follow four simple steps when replacing a JavaScript React component with a PureScript one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the component in idiomatic PureScript.</li>
<li>Write a separate interop module for the component. This module provides the JavaScript interface and conversion functions between PureScript and JavaScript types and idioms.</li>
<li>Use the PureScript compiler to generate JavaScript</li>
<li>Import the resulting code as if it were a regular JavaScript React component.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll start with the <code>react</code> library, which we use at Awake Security. It’s similar to <code>react-basic</code> but maps more directly to the underlying React code and is less opinionated. Later, we’ll switch to <code>react-basic</code>, which will demonstrate some differences between them.</p>

<p>As we take each step in this process I’ll explain more about why it’s necessary and some best practices to keep in mind. Let’s start: install the <code>react</code> library and prepare to write our component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># install the purescript-react library</span>
npx spago install react

<span># build the project so editors can pick up the `output` directory</span>
npx spago build

<span># create the component source file</span>
touch src/purescript/Counter.purs</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="1-write-the-react-component-in-idiomatic-purescript">1. Write the React component in idiomatic PureScript</h3>

<p>Even though we are writing a component to be used from JavaScript, we should still write ordinary PureScript. As we’ll soon see, it’s possible to adjust only the interface of the component for JavaScript but leave the internals untouched. This is especially important if this component is meant to be used by both PureScript and …</p></div></div>

<p>I have been toying with a theoretical idea for the past 18 months off-and-on in my head and I have not fully articulated it aloud yet. It is regarding the concept of <em>Ownership Semantics</em> (OS) or <em>Move Semantics</em> in programming languages. Fundamentally this article is a criticism of the concept and states that the concept is a duality of traditional OOP but applied to a different area.</p>
<h2 id="general-definitions-of-terminology">General Definitions of Terminology</h2>
<p>A general list of definitions of terminology used within this article in order to minimize confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>Value</em> is a datum with an associated type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>(Data) Type</em> is an attribute of a value which encodes information about how the data value can be operated upon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Object</em> is a value with associated behaviour, and thus implies it has <em>agency</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Class</em> is the data type of an <em>Object</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hierarchy of value ownership is a hierarchy of responsibility of values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Owned-Value</em> is a value which belongs to a hierarchy of value ownership, which implies it is governed by an <em>agent</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Agent</em> is an actor with the capacity to act within a given environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Model of Interpretation</em> is a way to view and analyse a subject</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Paradigm</em> is a way of classifying models of structure of programming languages; a <em>Paradigm</em> is a <em>model of interpretation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> - A paradigm of structuring a program around the sole concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ownership/Move Semantics (OS)</em> - Orientation around responsibility of values in a hierarchical fashion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-object-orientation-paradigm">Foundations of the Object Orientation Paradigm</h2>
<p>Though the original conception of the term coined by Alan Kay<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was never used as he intended it to be, the term <em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> has been commonly understood to be a paradigm of structuring a program around the concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit. Many languages support multiple paradigms, including aspects for the OOP paradigm, but I would class those as multiparadigm rather than being <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most languages implement <em>Objects</em> and <em>Classes</em> in the Simula tradition; most of the notable OOP languages have a similar form by defining methods (member functions) within the class definition. Traditionally languages such as Java can be classed as <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most traditional OOP languages are based around the concept of <em>inheritance</em>, a mechanism of deriving a class data type from another class data type and retaining similar information. Most people generally view inheritance as a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtyping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a> through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables (vtables)</a>. This has lead to many discussions asking whether a language can be called as OOP if it does not support inheritance<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent times, <em>inheritance</em> has been falling out of fashion in favour of <em>composition</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This is mostly due to the issue of conforming a <em>class</em> to a strict (singular) hierarchy of agency when in reality, things can belong to many (if not infinite) categories and hierarchies, as well as another aspect which I will be discussing throughout this article.</p>
<p>There are many criticisms of OOP<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> but my general criticism is that by placing emphasis on trying to solve problem in the type system, it shifts focus from the data structures and algorithms, <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/#the-concept-of-programming">the core of what a program fundamentally is</a>.</p>
<p>Since objects themselves are being treated <em>as if</em> they have behaviour (not just type properties), they are effectively being treated as if they were <em>agents</em> in the program. This mental model has many conclusions, many of which cause issues.</p>
<p>In my article <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/"><em>Pragmatism in Programming Proverbs</em></a>, I state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object orientated programming is a form of misinterpreted and misapplied Aristotelian Metaphysics applied to a domain it was never meant to model</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this statement is that <em>artificially</em> conforming any/all relationships between data and types to an artificial hierarchy of <em>agency</em> is a form of naïve-Aristotelian metaphysics. Since there is no actual <em>agency</em> in the programming objects, it is a partial fallacy. When trying to conform a program to have a particular structure when it does not naturally, the absence of a structure in a program is more useful than a bad structure.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>The concept of adding methods to classes/objects has proven useful to many. The real questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>And how do people actually conceptualize methods on a day-to-day basis?</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people, I am going to bet that methods, in languages with an emphasis on inheritance rather than composition (such as C++ or Java), are treated as a way of categorizing and associating functions/procedures with a data record. There are a few reasons for this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to organize and search for procedures by a data type</li>
<li>Allowing methods as a form of syntactic sugar for writing calls in a <em>subject verb object</em> manner e.g. <code>foo_do_thing(x, y)</code> vs <code>x.do_thing(y)</code></li>
<li>Mental model of behaviour for objects</li>
</ul>
<p>From experience, I have found that long time users of “OOP” languages eventually start treating methods primarily in the first two approaches.</p>
<p>I will not go into depth about the other main aspects of OOP such as encapsulation, local retention, forms of polymorphism, etc, as the hierarchical nature is the fundamental aspect of focus for this article. The (linear) hierarchy of agency is the main problem. The reason why people argue for <em>composition over inheritance</em> is that it flattens this linear hierarchy, reducing its effect. It is the transition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal typing</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural typing</a>, which is more flexible because many data structures and problems have a <em>non-linear</em> nature to them, which <em>linear</em> approaches <strong>cannot</strong> handle. When trying to adhere to the the strict hierarchical type system approaches, it leads to numerous issues because data is more commonly graph-like (non-linear) than tree-like (linear) for most problems. This strict hierarchy does occur with encapsulation at the object level too, a strict hierarchy of messages/references; this hierarchical nature arises from the concept agency itself, inheritance is not the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> Inheritance is not all bad and does have many real life practical uses, but these costs must be known before using them, like with any tool.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> The linearity is with regards to the data structures themselves and not the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-ownership-semantics-paradigm">Foundations of the Ownership Semantics Paradigm</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++11</a> introduced the concept of <em>move semantics</em> or <em>ownership semantics</em> (OS), a way to minimize the copying of data through copy constructors. It utilizes the added concept of r-value references (<code>T &amp;&amp;</code>) as a means to do this. However, the concept began to be used for a lot more than its basic purpose. The concept adds the high level abstraction of “moving” objects rather than “copying” objects. Physically, a computer only ever copies and this high level abstraction, to treat objects <em>as if</em> they were “real objects”, is not what actually happens. It is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake">category error</a> to treat them as “real objects” since “real objects” and “programming objects” have little connection with each other ontologically. When a value or object is “moved”, this means is that the <em>responsibilities</em> of the resources of that object have been transferred to another object or environment—<em>agents</em>. In this case, ownership/move semantics is fundamentally based around the <em>responsibilities of values</em> by tracking value usage.</p>
<p>In this model of agency, the arena of agency can take on many forms, such as blocks, procedure bodies, or aggregate values. Therefore some <em>owned-values</em> also <em>own</em> other values, and thus a value could have agency.</p>
<p>If we were to call Ownership Semantics a paradigm, it would be the orientation around the <em>responsibility of values</em> in a hierarchical fashion, placing emphasis on this system of responsibility, shifting focus from data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>responsibility</em> and <em>ownership</em> is similar to the real world counter parts in that to own something means to have exclusive use and full responsibility over it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a multi-paradigm programming language but at its core is an Ownership-Orientated language. Everything in Rust has a concept of <em>“ownership”</em> and <em>lifetime</em> associated with it. Rust is designed around trying to be first and foremost “safe”, especially with regards to concurrency. Rust derives from the C++ family in terms of philosophy and style, but uses a more <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2018/03/12/on-the-aesthetics-of-the-syntax-of-declarations/">qualifier-focused</a> declaration syntax and many concepts from functional languages from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML family</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lifetimes</em> are theoretically orthogonal to <em>ownership</em> but in practical, they usually are intrinsically coupled. I will not discuss the problems with object-based lifetimes in this article.</p>
<p>The following Rust code can be used to demonstrate this responsibility transfer between different capturing things such as <code>let</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Foo {
	value: i32,
}

fn main() {
	let foo = Foo{value: 123};
	let bar = foo; // the responsibility of `foo` is transferred to `bar`

	println!("{}", foo.value); // error: use of moved value: `foo.value`
	println!("{}", bar.value);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Rust is an immutable-by-default language, with the option to opt into mutability with <code>mut</code>. Immutability helps a lot with mathematical proofs for logic since things things can be “flattened” quite easily, however virtually all computers are fundamentally mutable things, even if the abstraction of immutability is a useful tool. As a result, the ownership semantics system requires a few more rules to take into account mutability, by adding the concept of “borrowing” through references. The general rules for the borrow checker are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value may have as many immutable borrows as you want</li>
<li>Each value may only have one mutable borrow at a time</li>
<li>Each value may not borrow immutably and mutably at the same time</li>
<li>Values will be “dropped” when the owning connecting goes out of scope</li>
<li>Taking a value by <code>self</code> <code>Drop</code>s the original value</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Rust (or move semantics to their full extent in C++11), most people will fight the borrow …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Life before a software engineering career is commonly a series of time-bound efforts to gain competency in a new area. This semester you learn geometry. That semester you learn history. Next semester you learn calculus. And so on.</p>

<p>As a result, most people entering the software engineering workforce equate learning with learning a brand new topic. I didn’t know ruby, I learned ruby. I didn’t know SQL, now I know SQL.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking leads people to 2 year cycles. On most modern software teams, it takes roughly one year to really feel like you have your feet under you. By that time the kind of learning novelty people are used to isn’t there. By 16 months they’re restless. By 24 months they’re gone.</p>

<p>This is a problem. It’s a problem because the majority of durable and transferable knowledge comes after achieving basic competency. Mastery of a skillset, understanding and learning from the outcomes of decisions made years ago, architecture and design, leading projects - these all come well after basic competency.</p>

<p>Not only does a life of cyclic learning work against reaching these next levels, but your ego and willpower also work against you. Those next-level skills are harder to learn. And once you’ve gained competency you lose the excuse of “I’m onboarding” or “still ramping up” when something goes wrong.</p>

<p>I always challenge engineers that want to make big changes in what they’re working on to consider whether they’re simply at the end of a novelty cycle. I always encourage them to go after those next level skills.</p>

<p>On the hiring front, I see a lot of people who have a career’s worth of 2-year stints. You can do that successfully for an entire career, and there are even some people that’ll tell you it’s a way to optimize earnings over time. If it does, I believe it only optimizes earnings for people who can’t get to those next level skills. The biggest earnings come from building and growing with a winning company.</p>

<p>24-monthers never deeply learn how things work. They’ll typically add value to a new company by carrying a collection of things they’ve seen before and shallowly applying them to similar problems. But when faced with a new problem that doesn’t map easily to the solutions they’ve seen, things start to break down.</p>

<p>The end-games for both careers are very different.</p>

<p>24-monthers eventually can get into C-level positions where it’s not uncommon to bring in someone who can just apply the common solutions to the similar task at hand. Their stints usually end right around the time where they’ve upleveled the company in some way and don’t know how to grow their team or evolve their strategy or deal with the short-comings of some of their decisions.</p>

<p>People who learn next level skills and how to deeply understand and react to the tasks at hand lead companies to uniquely successful outcomes. The best CEOs, the best CTOs, the best C-level anything - their careers are often a small handful of long-duration roles where they didn’t apply rote practices but innovated and reacted to change and created novel solutions based on deep understanding.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m not saying you should stay with any given job. There are bad roles and bad bosses and everything in between. And skill diversification is important. But every job has problems. If you’re leaving because you’re chasing novelty or avoiding tackling your company’s challenges, you’ll start over in the cycle. Leave enough places for these reasons and you’ll find you’ve seriously limited your opportunities and earnings over time.</p>

Cloud native applications are increasingly distributed, evolving faster and failing in new ways, making it harder to monitor, troubleshoot and resolve incidents. Traditional approaches such as dashboards, carefully tuned alert rules and searches through logs are reactive and time intensive, hurting productivity, the user experience and MTTR. We believe machine learning can do much better – <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/blog/using-machine-learning-to-detect-anomalies-in-logs" rel=" noopener">detecting anomalous patterns</a> automatically, creating highly diagnostic incident alerts and shortening time to resolution.</p>

<h3>What do you imagine when you see "Anomaly Detection"?</h3>
<p>When you think about anomaly detection, you probably visualize it for metrics: detection of outlier values like peaks, dropouts, or other deviations from normal. <img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=303&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png" alt="anomaly detection" width="303" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=152&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 152w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=303&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 303w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=455&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 455w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=606&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 606w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=758&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 758w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=909&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 909w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px">In the realm of application monitoring metrics are a scheduled measurements of a large set (thousands) of system health attributes – such as CPU, memory, latency and throughput. So metrics anomaly detection can be a useful tool to detect application health incidents, with the metrics anomalies serving as symptoms of the incident. A challenge with traditional time series anomaly detection is that it is noisy – applications can generate thousands of metrics, and in any given day it’s common to see many of them deviating from their historical ranges. Alerting on all of these would be a noisy mess,so users need to do more work to avoid alert fatigue. They must handpick which ones really matter, carefully tune thresholds, make adjustments for seasonality and trend lines, plus be thoughtful about algorithm selection.</p>
<p><br>This approach is untenable to detect new failure modes (unknown failure modes with as yet unknown symptoms). And it does not take advantage of the fact that when software incidents occur, they almost never impact just one metric. For example, memory contention on a node impacts multiple containers. Similarly, network bottlenecks impact latency for many operations which show up in metrics.</p>

<p>To be useful for incident detection, anomaly detection has to work autonomously across all time series, but also separate the signal from&nbsp;the noise by picking out the hotspots of correlated anomalies that are indicators of real problems. And to be even more useful, it should automatically correlate these metric anomaly hotspots with something that is even harder to build rules for – anomalies in log events. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span><strong>Anomaly detection applied to logs is very different</strong></span></h3>

<p>Log events are generated synchronous with execution of specific software paths. This makes them incredibly granular (micro-second or even finer resolution). They are also rich: since log events are only generated when specific conditions are encountered, they can selectively output data with almost unbounded cardinality (such as labels and IDs). Most significantly, events provide the best indication of causality. Where metrics measure aggregate symptoms about the application, log events are closely linked to specific code paths or error conditions in the software. For all of the above reasons, logs are an invaluable trove of information, so troubleshooting invariably involves digging through logs to find out root cause of an incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What if you didn’t have to do this reactively? Why couldn’t anomaly detection also be applied to events, with the goal of detecting highly unusual patterns of code execution, or rare errors or conditions. In other words, patterns that are diagnostic of a software problem, an infrastructure issue that impacts the application, or even security incidents. This is a bit harder to conceptualize than anomaly detection for metrics, but here is how it works.</p>
<h3>Learn what to track</h3>
<p>Metrics are explicitly tagged with labels and IDs – so it is clear what is being measured. Unfortunately, the link between a specific log event and the corresponding line of code is not explicit – most log events don’t contain references to source code, and they are typically unstructured, free form outputs coded by developers to help them troubleshoot. As a result, many of them look similar to the human eye because they contain similar keywords or strings.</p>

<p>Luckily machine learning can do far better than a human in this regard – it only needs to see a few variants of each message type to fully extract the fixed and variable parts of each message type – rapidly learning all the unique message types. This essentially constitutes the “dictionary” <strong><em>of all unique event types generated by the application stack</em></strong> – all that’s</p>

<p>Note that this event type dictionary is not as big as you might think – an entire Atlassian suite has fewer than 1,000 unique event types.</p>

This includes things such as its frequency, periodicity, severity, and even the values of metrics embedded within each event type. Now when a log event breaks pattern significantly, it is anomalous.</p>

<p>Particularly important variants include the first occurrence of a very rare event, and the sudden stoppage of a normal event (e.g. a system heartbeat).</p>

<p>s, with hundreds if not thousands of instances (many of them ephemeral), scaling operations and frequent updates. Good anomaly detection can be very selective - picking out the one in a million event that is truly anomalous. However, one in a million would still be too many things to focus on in an environment that generates billions of messages a day. Once again, machine learning to the rescue – it takes advantage of the fact that a single anomaly in one event type is rarely alert worthy – but when tightly clustered group of anomalies pops up across multiple event streams – that IS almost always alert worthy. What constitutes “unusually tight cluster” depends on the specific deployment of an application, so it needs to be learned on the fly.</p>
<h3>See a complete narrative</h3>
<p>This type of anomaly clustering doesn’t just improve signal to noise by several orders of magnitude. It also constructs an automatic summary of the incident – picking out the sequence of anomalous events and the related anomalous metrics, as well as highlighting the hosts and log types that fully describe the incident.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Done right, anomaly detection can <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/blog/is-autonomous-monitoring-the-anomaly-detection-you-actually-wanted" rel=" noopener">enable autonomous incident creation</a>, making it an incredibly powerful pillar of a monitoring strategy. It detects previously unknown problems the first time they occur, and reduces MTTR by automatically surfacing the unusual events and anomalies in metrics that describes an incident. But doing it right means understanding unique event types, learning the patterns and correlations of log events and metrics, and detecting anomaly clusters with good signal to noise. And for this to be practical, all of this has to work without extensive configuration, manual tuning, or impractical training windows.</p>
